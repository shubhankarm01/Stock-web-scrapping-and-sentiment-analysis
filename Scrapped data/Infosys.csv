Simple. To tell current and potential investors about how the company fared and the road ahead. One does not expect CEOs to be gifted writers like Gabriel García Márquez or Ernest Hemingway. But a good letter can be a promising pointer to realistic management. Understandably, some investors, like Warren Buffett, use a CEO’s letter as one guidepost to know if they want to invest in a company. “Over the years, there have been multiple times reading the annual letter has been a factor in my deciding to do something or not to do something,"" Buffett has said in the past. Twich+ read the CEO letter at each of the ten largest IT services companies to understand if investors are getting any wiser.                              "
Updated: 05 Jul 2022,IT services firms likely to report strong revenue in Q1,https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/it-services-firms-likely-to-report-strong-revenue-in-q1-11657042305039.html,"BENGALURU :   Top Indian IT services companies are expected to report strong revenue growth of 2.3-4.3% quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q) in constant currency during the fiscal first quarter ended June, according to analysts. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) will kick off the earnings season on Friday. However, the peak revenue growth of these companies is likely to be behind them and the momentum is expected to start softening from H2 FY23 due to absence of large deal wins and clients postponing their technology spends. While the long-term demand environment remains unaltered, elevated inflation and an economic slowdown in the US and Europe is likely to impede growth in the second half of the fiscal. “We anticipate Infosys to lead on organic revenue front with growth of 4.3% QoQ in constant currency, followed by TCS at 3.6% QoQ in constant currency. Growth in Tech Mahindra, Wipro and HCL Technologies is expected to be soft due to seasonal weakness and moderation in demand,"" ICICI Securities said in a pre-earnings note. Margins are likely to be under pressure due to wage hikes, higher backfilling costs, increase in travel/visa/other discretionary costs with the easing of travel restrictions, and back-to-office trends, said Emkay Research. “Due to cross-currency headwinds, benefits from rupee depreciation will be marginal in Q1."" The brokerage firm expects Infosys to retain its annual revenue growth guidance of 13-15% in constant currency and EBIT margin guidance of 21-23% for FY23. HCL Technologies is also likely to retain its 12-14% revenue growth and 18-20% EBIT margin guidance range. Wipro should guide for a 2.5-4.5% sequential growth in constant currency with Rizing adding about 1% incrementally for Q2 FY23. In the absence of large deal wins, smaller deals will drive deal intake in the June quarter. “ACV (annual contract value) of signed deals to remain strong. We expect the deal intake to remain healthy across companies in Q1, with an uptick in smaller deals (led by clients’ urgency to execute digital transformation deals quickly) driven by increased demand for cloud adoption, digital transformation and customer experience transformation deals,"" Emkay Research said."
Updated: 05 Jul 2022,Indices erase all gains to end in red; Sensex falls over 700 pts from day's high,https://www.livemint.com/market/live-blog/share-market-live-updates-sensex-nifty-bse-nse-stock-market-today-05-07-2022-hdfc-bank-hdfc-11656985662464.html,"Nifty and Sensex jumped over 1% around mid-session trade on Tuesday but turned negative later in the day amid weakness in global markets as concern over the possibility of a recession outweighed optimism over US-China talks aimed at tariff reductions. Markets will take cues from US Fed minutes of meeting on Wednesday and the June quarter earnings season going forward.  Benchmark indices erased all gains made in the first half of trade on Tuesday as US futures and European markets fell. Sensex slipped 732 points from intra-day high to close 100 points lower at 53,134 . Nifty failed to hold the 16,000 level, ending 215 points from highs to end 25 points lower at 15,811. Infosys, ITC and HDFC were the biggest contributors to the fall on Sensex. ITC, Wipro, HDFC Life, Britannia Industries and Maruti Suzuki were among the laggards on Nifty. Barring Nifty Metal and Pharma, all sectoral indices ended in the red. The BSE midcap index fell 0.4%, while BSE Smallcap index rose 0.2%. The Indian rupee plunged 41 paise to a record low of 79.36 against US dollar.   Inflation-targeted monetary and liquidity tightening, along with hardening rates, generally comes bundled with a system-level GDP/credit growth sacrifice. For banks, it also seems reasonable to expect a rise in borrower segment-specific risk aversion. As we state in our sector initiation Shaken, not stirred, the signature impact of rising rates is not the small boost to margins, but the acceleration of prime credit market share gain for high-CASA large private banks. We do not foresee major asset-quality incidents and adequate provisioning/capitalisation raises insulation. Too soon for a rate hike impact, too late for Covid surprises However, (i) slowing credit growth, (ii) small boost in margins and (iii) mix shift toward prime credit are unlikely to manifest in 1QFY23 results, we think. Even in an accelerated timeline, the earliest print impact should not predate 2QFY23. On the other hand, Covid-driven “irregular"" assets have settled in “restructured"" or “GNPA"" buckets with a clear line of sight on provisioning and credit costs. Problems are known and their quantum more or less crystallised. We expect 21% NII growth, 17% PPoP growth and 49% PAT growth y-y in our coverage aggregate. Commentary key to finer nuances of sector strategy This is the first quarter during which banks will discuss inflation and material interest rate hikes as baseline expectations, not possibilities. They will have even more clarity on their provisioning trajectory for restructured and other “irregular"" assets and lay out their segment preferences and pricing strategy in relation to the evolving macro situation. For us, this holds the key to gauging their earnings trajectory over the next 12-15 months and should set the yardstick against which performance will likely be evaluated by the stock market. Early disclosures offer no major surprises Of the banks under our coverage that have made early disclosures on 1QFY23 fundamentals – HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank and AU Small Finance Bank – none have delivered surprises that necessitate re-evaluation of our sector stance. AU and IndusInd have shown a strong set of numbers that are marginally ahead of expectations, while HDFCB has disappointed a bit on CASA (2.2% y-y decline), but with a higher-than-expected (5% y-y) retail loan growth as a silver lining.   Britannia Industries' shareholders have voted against a resolution to authorise the board to make investments, give loans and provide guarantees of up to ₹5,000 crore in the AGM concluded last week. The special resolution for approval to increase limits for making investments, loans, Special guarantees and security was ""not Passed with requisite majority,"" said a regulatory filing from Britannia Industries on June 29, 2022.   US index futures and European equities fell as concern over the possibility of a recession outweighed optimism over US-China talks aimed at tariff reductions. The euro slipped to a 20-year low.

The issue has a base issue size of ₹150 crore with an option to retain an oversubscription of up to ₹150 crore, aggregating to ₹300 crore.

(Reuters)   Automobile retail registration data reported by FADA indicates total vehicle retail for Jun’22 increased by 27% YoY with growth across categories i.e. 2W, 3W, PV, Tractors and CV were. However, compared with Pre-Covid level of Jun’19, total vehicle retail was down by -9% with sharper decline in 2W and 3W which de-grew by 16% and 6% respectively. Though few categories are consistently showing recovery, full recovery is yet to be witnessed when compared to pre-covid times. Increased wholesale reflects ease in semi-conductor availability thus reducing supply side constraints going ahead. We expect strong bounce back in 2HFY23 with rural recovery post favourable monsoon and further ease on semiconductor availability. We expect YoY volume growth across categories in FY23E with M&HCVs and 3Ws expected to record 30%+ growth.   Passenger vehicle retail sales in the country rose 40 per cent in June indicating an improvement in semiconductor supplies even as demand, especially for SUVs, remained robust, auto dealer' body FADA said on Tuesday.

This is according to the Asia Insights of The State of Cyber Resilience, published Tuesday by Marsh, the world’s leading insurance broker and risk advisor, and Microsoft Corp., a leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world.   Shares of Marksans Pharma rallied more than 17% to ₹50 apiece on the BSE in Tuesday's trading session after the company informed its plans to consider the issue of bonus shares.

Gold rates in India continued their recent uptrend with futures on MCX hitting over two-month high of ₹52261 per 10 gram, up 0.2% from previous close. Silver futures rose 0.5% to ₹58,780. Despite inflation and growth worries, gold has been under pressure in the past few months amid rate hikes by central banks to tame runaway inflation.   India's dominant services industry expanded at the fastest pace in over eleven years in June amid strong demand but stubborn inflation remains a concern as prices charged rose at the sharpest rate in almost five years, a private survey showed no Tuesday. The S&P Global India Services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 59.2 in June from 58.9 in May, its highest since April 2011 and above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. A Reuters poll had predicted a dip to 58.7.   Nifty has shown a strong follow-up buying post the favorable previous trading session that could be seen as an encouraging sign for the bulls of D-street. On technical parameters, the 15700-sub zone has once again proved its mettle, and till the time index manages to sustain above the same, any minor correction could be seen as a buying opportunity in the near term. On the contrary, the 15950-16000 zone is likely to act as a sturdy wall, and only a breakthrough could ascertain the bullish momentum to continue in the coming sessions. The market has seen some strong traction by the fag end favoring the bulls. However, the global market could act as a catalyst in either propelling the bullish sentiments or putting a halt to the same. Hence, keeping a tab on the developments across the global bourses is advisable. Meanwhile, our index is likely to stay within the mentioned range until any decisive breakthrough on either of the sides is not seen. Hence considering the recent price action, we advocate utilizing any dip towards the support zone and continuing with a stock-specific approach for better trading opportunities.   India’s trade deficit widened to a record in June, adding further pressure on the Indian currency, which has hit new lows against the dollar in the past weeks. Merchandise exports growth slowed for the third straight month in June to touch a four-month low of $37.94 billion, while imports surged by 51% to a record $63.58 billion from a year earlier      Tata Steel Long Products up 3% as company has completed the acquisition of state-owned Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd for ₹12,100 crore, the Centre said.

Demand softness witnessed towards end of the quarter, due to commodity price correction (~10-15% in June month) and offset of summer season. Overall companies have been reluctant in taking price hikes. Although commodity cost correction has begun, our channel check indicate that further price hike will be inevitable going forward. Rural demand remains weak. We expect our consumer durables universe to register sales growth of 70% YoY (low base due to COVID 2nd wave). With sustained RM inflation, inability to increase prices due to weak demand and return of some discretionary costs, we expect margins to remain under pressure (+10bps QoQ) for our coverage universe. We expect EBITDA/PAT growth of 98%/ 103% YoY (low base due to COVID 2nd wave) across our coverage universe. Although we remain structurally positive on long term prospects, we see demand headwinds due to high inflation in near term We maintain our positive stance on Consumer Durables because of low penetration and market consolidation. Butterfly acquisition will further strengthen its positioning in kitchen appliance market. We rate CROMPTON as our top pick. We believe Voltas’s re-rating depends upon market share rebound in room AC segment which we expect to happen by year end. Havells’s is benefitting from Lloyd’s ramp-up but profitability is yet to improve which would further re-rate the stock. Weak rural demand is not favorable for Bajaj Electrical in near term. KEI/Polycab wil continue to benefit from industrial uptick.   U.S. equities were closed on Monday for Independence Day holiday. Recession fears are likely to dominate the markets going forward.

The primary reason for this has been the strength of the US dollar. At the beginning of the year, one US dollar was worth ₹74. Today, the same is worth ₹78. This means for every dollar you spend; you will have to pay ₹4 more.  This sharp move is attributable to numerous factors such as geopolitical tensions, rising inflation, and rising crude oil prices.  After a decade of historically low-interest rates and loose monetary policy, global central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, have hiked interest rates.  This move signals the end of accommodative policies, whose impact has trickled down to economies across the globe. As US interest rates rise, investors everywhere, flock to invest in the safe-haven dollar. This increased demand boosts the value of the dollar, weakening the rupee.                                                         "

Recession fears leading to possible reductions in IT spending by clients has also dampened the sentiment of the investors. Recently, various global brokerage and research firms have downgraded Indian IT sector, and also trimmed earnings estimates for FY23. Domestic brokerage and research firm Edelweiss in its latest report on IT said that it prefers HCL Tech, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) among the large-caps and Coforge, LTI and Mindtree among midcap IT stocks. Among small caps, it prefers Zensar Tech, Birlasoft and Firstsource Solutions. Accenture’s strong performance and solid commentary supports brokerage Edelweiss' thesis of a robust tech upcycle. “Its outsourcing growth remains high and bookings also remain strong, which bodes well for Indian IT services companies,"" it said in a note. Analysts at brokerage JM Financial said that Accenture’s results confirm the ‘All’s well for now’ thesis for Indian techs despite increasing concerns of hit on IT spending given a weak macro set up. “Our channel checks also suggest that demand is holding up well for Indian techs for now with the likely macro set up expected to benefit offshore techs, albeit with a lag."" Infosys and HCL Tech are the brokerage's top stock picks amongst Tier I techs, while Mphasis, Persistent Systems amongst Tier II ‘s and Zen Tech and Firstsource amongst small caps. “While supply-side challenges remain a point of concern, with elevated attrition and lower headcount addition, Accenture's margin guidance implies a stable margin performance in FY23. While strong revenue growth and commentary on the pipeline is positive for the IT Services sector, weak employee addition (lowest in the last six quarters) and moderation in deal bookings (-13% QoQ) should dampen the demand outlook,"" said another brokerage Motilal Oswal. The brokerage has maintained its positive stance on the IT sector as it expects sustained growth with stable margin.

Shares were higher in Europe and Asia on Friday despite data suggesting some economies are slowing. Shares rose in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and South Korea.  Indian indices on Friday closed higher, led by good buying support in telecom, financial and auto stocks. The Sensex gained 462.26 points, or 0.88%, to close at 52,727.98, while Nifty50 added 142.60 points to end at 15,699.25. Sectorally, telecom, bank, auto, and financial stocks performed well, while IT stocks dragged. On the 30-stock index, M&M, Bajaj Finance, IndusInd Bank, and HUL were the top performers, while TechM, Infosys, TCS, and HCL were among the biggest losers. On the Nifty50 index, M&M, Hero MotoCorp, and IndusInd Bank registered the biggest gains, while TechM, Infosys, and Apollo Hospitals were the biggest laggards.   The US dollar slipped on Friday and headed for its first weekly decline of June as traders dialled down bets on where interest rates might peak and brought forward the timing of rate cuts to counter a possible recession. A significant shift this week has been the fall in oil and commodity prices, which has eased inflation fears and allowed equity markets to rebound. This has eroded the safe-haven bid that's been boosting the greenback against major currencies.   Crude oil futures on Friday declined by 0.54 per cent to ₹8,178 per barrel as participants trimmed their positions on low demand. On the Multi Commodity Exchange, crude oil for July delivery fell by ₹44 or 0.54 per cent to ₹8,178 per barrel with a business volume of 3,881 lots. Globally, West Texas Intermediate crude oil was trading 0.09 per cent lower at USD 104.36 per barrel and Brent crude was 0.04 per cent down at USD 110.09 per barrel in New York.   Gold prices on Friday fell by ₹46 to ₹50,548 per 10 grams in futures trade as speculators reduced their positions. On the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold contracts for August delivery traded lower by ₹46 or 0.09 per cent at ₹50,548 per 10 grams in a business turnover of 12,159 lots. Analysts attributed the fall in gold prices to the trimming of positions by participants. Globally, gold was trading 0.32 per cent lower at USD 1,823.90 per ounce in New York.   Cottonseed oil cake prices on Friday declined by ₹3 to ₹2,597 per quintal in futures trade as participants reduced their bets tracking a weak trend in spot market. On the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange, cottonseed oil cake for July delivery fell by ₹3 or 0.12 per cent to ₹2,597 per quintal with an open interest of 78,700 lots. Analysts said sell-off by participants at existing levels amid subdued trend in market mainly weighed on cottonseed oil cake prices.   Copper futures on Friday fell by ₹4.85 to ₹693.40 per kilogram as participants cut their positions amid muted demand in domestic market. On the Multi Commodity Exchange, copper contracts for July delivery eased by ₹4.85 or 0.69 per cent to ₹693.40 per kg in a business turnover of 5,507 lots. Analysts said trimming of positions by speculators amid muted demand in spot market mainly dragged down copper prices in the futures trade.   Shares were higher in Europe and Asia on Friday despite data suggesting some economies are slowing. U.S. futures also advanced after a rally Thursday on Wall Street, where the market is headed for its first weekly gain after three weeks of punishing losses. Market players are looking ahead to U.S. inflation data due next week and hoping that the moderation in prices of oil and some other commodities this week is a sign inflation might be abating.   Rating: BUY | CMP: Rs354 | TP: Rs435 LIC Housing Finance (LICHF) saw a good quarter with a positive surprise on PAT led by beat on all fronts barring loan growth, that was a miss as volumes were impacted due to third covid wave. The company guided that disbursals could grow by 15% in FY23 and builder loans could see an uptick that might contribute 5-10% to credit flow. NII was ahead due to higher NIM driven by lower funding cost. Benefit of borrowing cost could continue, that might cushion NIM considering that fixed rate liabilities contribute 53% and interest rates could harden. Asset quality improved with GNPA/NNPA reducing QoQ by 40bps each led by better recoveries. LICHF performed well in H2FY22 while valuation at 0.8x is attractive. We maintain multiple at 1.0x FY24 ABV but slightly raise TP to Rs435. Upgrade from ACCUMULATE to BUY.   Global equity investors may be excited to see green on their screens this week but stock gains seem to be a function of a stronger shift toward defensives rather than a full-throated risk-on roar. A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. index of defensive stocks including megacap tech and healthcare names has climbed to more than an 18-month high relative to the MSCI AC World Index, as fears of a global recession outweigh concern over sky-high inflation. The gauge has jumped over 4% this week, double the rise in the global stocks benchmark -- itself on track for its first weekly gain in four. Investors are beginning to consider the consequences of a Federal Reserve that seems willing to hike the world’s largest economy into recession to defeat inflation. Chair Jerome Powell has called his commitment to curbing price rises “unconditional,"" giving a boost to havens like Treasuries this week and providing a fresh impetus for defensives to outperform.   India's retail inflation is likely to breach the mandated inflation target band of 2-6% for three straight quarters but is showing indications of peaking, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) deputy governor Michael Patra said on Friday.   A day after the central government revised its fiscal deficit target for FY2023 and stated it will limit it to the current year's numbers Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram criticised the government over the state of the Indian economy, asking if it was in the ""pink of health"" over high fiscal deficit, inflation, and the depreciating value of the rupee.   Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Michael D Patra on Friday said the Central Bank will not allow ""jerky movements"" of Rupee and stressed that the Indian currency has witnessed least depreciation in recent times.   Once seen as an attractive inflation hedge due to its limited supply, the ongoing turmoil in cryptocurrencies is likely to make investors sceptical about it.   Multibagger stocks: Adani Green Energy shares have delivered stellar 6,200 per cent return in last 10 years   Stocks rose in Asia on Friday following another rally on Wall Street as investors try to process central bank moves to fight soaring inflation and the growing possibility that those measures will induce a recession. Global markets have been thrown into turmoil for months by a perfect storm of crises that have left observers predicting a sharp contraction, including the Ukraine war, China's lockdown-induced economic troubles, supply chain snarls and spiking energy costs. Expectations that the Federal Reserve and other central banks will have to keep lifting rates have left many traders fretting that the pain could go on for some time, with sovereign bond yields -- key gauges to future rates -- continuing to climb.   Oil prices edged higher amid a volatile trading session on Friday, as supply uncertainty outweighed fears of slower demand from cooling U.S. economic activity. Brent crude futures climbed 31 cents, or 0.3%, at $110.36 a barrel by 0630 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 59 cents, or 0.6%, at $104.86 a barrel.   European stocks rebounded at the open Friday following another week of heavy losses for markets, including oil, on heightened fears of a global recession. London's benchmark FTSE 100 index gained 0.4 percent to 7,047.11 points, with investors brushing aside bruising defeats for Britain's ruling Conservatives in by-elections Thursday. The pound was little changed against the dollar and euro, also despite data showing a drop in UK retail sales volumes as inflation soars. In the eurozone, Frankfurt's DAX index won 0.3 percent to 12,947.75 points and the Paris CAC 40 gained 0.7 percent to 5,922.45.   The Central government is reportedly going to become the biggest shareholder of debt-ridden Vodafone Idea Limited, according to CNBT-TV18. The Centre may hold 33% around in the company and become the single largest shareholder in the third-largest telco in the country, as per the business news channel.   Jet Airways began its operational hiring and asked its former cabin crew members to rejoin the airline.   As surging inflation and the end of global easy-money policies send Indian stocks spiraling down from all-time highs, three charts show the pain is unlikely to end anytime soon.. The selloff comes as climbing costs and a record plunge in the rupee have forced the nation’s central bank to join global peers in raising interest rates.   The US dollar slipped against its major peers on Friday, on course for its first weekly decline this month as investors continue to assess the path for Federal Reserve policy and whether aggressive rate hikes would trigger a recession. The safe-haven currency also lost support amid improved market sentiment, which saw regional stock markets rise and buoyed riskier currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rivals, sank 0.2% to 104.19 in Asia. That undid the previous day's 0.19% rise, which was driven mostly by a decline in the euro after weak European factory data reduced bets for European Central Bank tightening.   Shares of Nazara Technologies rallied about 20% to ₹623 apiece on the BSE in Friday's trading session as the stock started trading ex-bonus ahead of its record date for the bonus shares issue. Bonus shares are fully paid additional shares issued by a company to its existing shareholders.   Dividend paying stock REC Ltd is going to consider issuance of bonus shares on 30th June 2022. In its meeting on 30th June 2022, board of directors of REC Limited will consider the proposal for issue of bonus shares to the equity shareholders of the company. The board is expected to decide ratio of bonus shares in this meeting as well. Bonus shares, if approved, will be another good news for shareholders as the company has already given interim dividend of ₹6 per equity share for the financial year 2022.   The selling in Nifty has shown signs of slowing down this week, with the index consolidating within a 500-point range since Monday. In doing so, Nifty is now forming an inverse Head and Shoulder pattern on the hourly chart, which is a bullish pattern. The neckline of this pattern is placed near 15630-15650 levels. If the index sustains above this zone, the recovery could extend towards 15900-16170 in the next few sessions. On the downside, 15400-15370 now becomes the immediate support zone for Nifty.   Gold and silver prices in India struggled today amid weak global cues. On MCX, gold futures declined to near two-week lows of ₹50,510 per 10 gram. Silver futures were marginally higher at ₹59,510 per kg. In global markets, gold rates were flat at $1,824.72 per ounce and remained on course for their second straight weekly decline. So far this week, gold prices have dropped about 0.9%, on worries of aggressive rate hikes by global central banks to counter runaway inflation. Among other precious metals, spot silver rose 0.4% to $21.02 per ounce but is set for weekly loss.   In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin price today rose above $21,000 mark. The world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency rose more than 4% and was trading at $21,083. The global cryptocurrency market cap today was below the $1 trillion, and was up over 4% in the last 24 hours to $977 billion, as per CoinGecko.   As the saying goes, there is no easy money in this world, you must make effort to make money. In real estate investments too, it is possible to make money via smart tools and instruments.   Recovering from its record low, the rupee opened 12 paise up at 78.20 against the US dollar on Friday, tracking a pullback in crude oil prices.

Global oil benchmark Brent crude futures fell 0.21 per cent to USD 109.82 per barrel.   Financial stocks led Indian shares higher early on Friday, setting the blue-chip indexes on course for their first week of gains in three, as a slide in commodity prices tempered inflation fears. The NSE Nifty 50 index rose 0.85% to 15,689.65, while the S&P BSE Sensex climbed 0.77% to 52,668.26. If gains hold, the blue-chip indexes are set to post weekly gains of over 2.5% each. The Nifty Bank index rose as much as 1.7%, led by a 3.7% jump in private-sector lender IndusInd Bank. Oil explorer ONGC climbed up to 4.6% after it said its unit made a new oil discovery in Colombia.

The government had earlier announced a reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹8 and ₹6 per liter respectively, so that the price of petrol and diesel will be at least ₹9.5 and upto ₹7 cheaper. Since then no fluctuations have occurred and oil prices have remained steady for over a month.

The euro retreated against the dollar Thursday as economic data pointed to increased prospects of recession in Europe, while Wall Street stocks finished higher following another volatile session.

Stocks shook off a midday slump and ended higher Thursday, keeping the market on track for its first weekly gain after three weeks of punishing losses. Trading was wobbly throughout the day as investors remained focused on another round of testimony before Congress by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Speaking before a House committee, Powell again stressed that the Fed hopes to rein in the worst inflation in four decades without knocking the economy into a recession, but acknowledged “that path has gotten more and more challenging."" The S&P 500 ended 1% higher after having been down as much as 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6% and the Nasdaq gained 1.6%.

That means it has dropped more than 20% from its most recent high, which was in January. The index has fallen for 10 of the last 11 weeks.  "
Updated: 24 Jun 2022,IT firms bet on organic cloud platforms,https://www.livemint.com/industry/infotech/it-firms-bet-on-organic-cloud-platforms-11656014158470.html,"BENGALURU : Top software services companies like Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd are betting big on organic cloud platforms built in-house to help customers accelerate their cloud journeys. The shift to cloud has accelerated due to the pandemic. According to Gartner, by 2025, 51% of IT spending in the areas of application software, infrastructure software, business process services and system infrastructure markets is expected to shift to public cloud, compared to 41% in 2022. Traditional offerings, constituting 58.7% of revenue in 2022, should witness a much slower growth than cloud. “Surge in cloud adoption could prove to be a growth lever for IT service providers on the back of cloud platforms created by them to help speed up cloud transformation journey of clients, thereby improving the utilization of cloud capacity subscribed by clients, and thus, translating bookings into revenues for hyperscalers partners,"" analysts at ICICI Securities said. Infosys has developed an organic cloud platform known as Cobalt, comprising a set of services, solutions, and platforms to help clients, mostly large enterprises, build new cloud-first capabilities. It offers 14,000 cloud assets and over 200 industry cloud solution blueprints. Infosys has also created a Polycloud platform, which enables enterprises to procure, build, and manage vendor-agnostic solutions across multiple hybrid cloud providers without worrying about vendor lock-in. Similarly, TCS Enterprise Cloud is a cloud platform that provides a range of flexible cloud infrastructure options to support dynamic cloud services. It offers data services built on an open-source stack supporting big data, analytics, internet of things (IoT). Cloud Smart by HCL Technologies aims to “reimagine"" the cloud to provide an adaptive portfolio of innovative cloud services driven by high-tech automation and a robust partner ecosystem. Last year, Wipro committed to invest $1 billion to strengthen its cloud technologies, capabilities, acquisitions, and partnerships over the next three years. As part of this, it launched Wipro FullStride Cloud Services, which brings together the full portfolio of Wipro’s cloud-related capabilities, offerings, and talent."

Good levels to buy?",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/tcs-infosys-shares-trade-near-52-week-lows-good-level-to-buy-the-it-stocks-11655711031690.html,"Shares of top Indian IT companies Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys have fallen sharply amid the current market volatility and the IT stocks are trading near their respective 52-week low levels. TCS shares are down about 18% in 2022 so far whereas that of Infosys have fallen more than 25% during the same period. Domestic brokerage and research firm Motilal Oswal is bullish on the IT stocks and has Buy tags on both TCS and Infosys shares with a target price of ₹4,240 and ₹2,000 apiece respectively. “TCS maintains its long-term aspirational margin band at 26-28% as it does not see any change in its long-term cost structure or relative competitiveness. Higher-quality revenue is aiding margin resilience in TCS,"" the note stated. Meanwhile, Infosys delivered a margin of 23% on the back of strong growth, despite margin pressures in FY22. With attrition moderating, an improvement in pricing, lower dependency on sub-contractors, higher fresher additions, and strong operating leverage, both companies should be able to sustain margins going forward, as per the brokerage. With rising demand, attracting talent, training, and retention gained paramount importance, both TCS and Infosys hired in record numbers in FY22. ""Balance sheets for both IT companies remains strong and liquid (with cash at 21-34% of assets and ~4% of market capitalization). Sub-optimal assets like goodwill/intangibles remained low for TCS and Infosys. Further, RoE of TCS (~44%) and Infosys (~29%) remained the best across the industry. Both companies also reported strong payouts in FY22 (TCS/INFO – 97%/75%),"" Motilal Oswal highlighted. Given the capabilities of TCS and Infosys, both companies are in good position to withstand a weakening macro environment. Margin should remain stable, despite the headwinds, on account of moderation in attrition, strong fresher addition, and a positive pricing environment, it added. The brokerage remains positive on the IT Services sector on reasonable valuations and good double-digit earnings growth (partially aided by a 300-350 bp impact from the depreciation in the INR v/s the USD) in FY23.

Last year, Eicher Motors Ltd witnessed an institutional investor revolt against giving a 10% raise to managing director Siddhartha Lal. India’s largest technology services companies are not among the companies that face this challenge. At six of the largest IT services firms, not a single resolution regarding CEO compensation has seen any major dissent by public shareholders over the last decade, according to filings reviewed by Twich+. This is not to conclude that all is well, but we’ll come to it in a bit. The simple point is the chief executives at the largest IT services companies are not overpaid.

The courses will target “students and young adults"" in tier-II and tier-III cities in India, according to a joint media statement issued by Infosys and HBP. As part of the offering, Infosys’ Springboard will now host free articles, videos and podcasts from Harvard Business Review (HBR), as well as 10 courses on topics such as project management and change management offered under Harvard ManageMentor. The latter is an online learning division managed by HBR, which offers a total of 42 courses and additional online resources designed to add management skills to a young professional’s portfolio. The Harvard ManageMentor portfolio is generally available for users to subscribe, and costs about ₹3,900 per year for each course, ₹9,700 per year for four courses, or the entire resource pool from ManageMentor for about ₹52,000 per year. Vinay Hebbar, senior vice-president and head of international markets at HBP, said that the suite of online courses is designed to help “drive employability among underserved students and youth."" To make the course available, Infosys said it will directly partner with schools and colleges across India, to give access to HBP and HBR’s courses via Springboard. An offering such as this is part of an increasing suite of digital upskilling courses, which have become commonplace across India. In March this year, an industry report by Amazon Web Services (AWS) said that 95% of India’s working professionals feel the need to upskill themselves by pursuing new digital skills to keep up with changing demands of the modern-day workplace. Various roles, including in management and human resources, are constantly changing as technology takes over a bigger part of everyday lives. Earlier this month, a Mint report found that companies are looking at artificially intelligent bots to replace human jobs of basic skill levels – hence further highlighting the need to learn new skills."

The domestic equities also tracked global woes as investors betted cautiously ahead of US Fed and European Central Bank policy. Following this, more than ₹5.16 lakh crore of investors' wealth has been wiped out from Dalal Street. Nearly half of the total losses were seen in the top -10 most valued companies. Life insurance giant LIC was the worst hit. The top two heavyweights Reliance Industries and TCS also took a significant beating. Data on BSE shows that the total equity market capitalisation stood at more than ₹251.84 lakh crore on Friday. From June 6 to 10th, the market cap plunged by ₹5.16 lakh crore. The valuation was a little over ₹257 lakh crore on June 3. Notably, in the past five trading sessions, Sensex nosedived by 1,465.79 points or 2.63%, while Nifty 50 shed 382.5 points or 2.31%.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, ""Rising inflation fears gripped the domestic market leading to heavy sell-off ahead of the release of US inflation data & Fed policy meet next week. The inflation data will be crucial to sense the quantum of a rate hike. European Central Bank in its policy meeting signaled to start rate hike from next month and a large change in September. Persisted foreign fund outflow and widening trade deficit due to the elevated oil prices led to depreciation of INR, weakening the sentiment."" The top ten most valued companies accounted for nearly half of the losses witnessed on Dalal Street. As per a PTI report, the market capitalisation (m-cap) of the top-10 most valued companies eroded by over ₹2.29 lakh crore last week. On BSE, LIC's market cap slipped by a massive ₹57,272.85 crore to ₹4,48,885.09 crore. The insurer holds the seventh rank in the most valued firms list currently on the exchange. Meanwhile, LIC which got listed on May 17, has witnessed a more than ₹1.51 lakh crore decline in market cap against the IPO issue price. At the IPO's upper price band of ₹949 apiece, LIC's market cap before listing stood at ₹6,00,240 crore. Meanwhile, RIL's market cap dipped by ₹44,311.19 crore to ₹18,36,039.28 crore. Furthermore, IT giants TCS and Infosys cumulatively lost a market cap of ₹45,746.13 crore. As of June 10, TCS' market cap stood at ₹12,31,398.85 crore and Infosys at ₹6,21,502.63 crore. At present, in terms of market capitalisation, RIL holds the top spot followed by TCS. HDFC Bank and Infosys hold the third and fourth spots as most valued companies.

The order of these top-10 firms on BSE are - RIL, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, Infosys, HUL, ICICI Bank, LIC, SBI, HDFC, and Bharti Airtel Yesha Shah, Head of Equity Research, Samco Securities said, ""Despite the fact that this week's trading patterns suggest additional downside, the overall bearish momentum has moderated as Nifty is currently trading above the falling resistance line. As long as Nifty does not fall below 15,900, there is a significant chance that it can test 16,800 levels. We recommend traders keep a neutral view for the coming week and avoid aggressive trades on either side."" Weekly market outlook: Samco Securities, Head of Equity Research, said, ""Globally, Fed's interest rate decision as well as the volatility in crude price will keep market anxious. Back home, the CPI and WPI inflation print will be the main headliner next week. Markets participants will keenly analyse whether the import duty restrictions and rate hikes have had a positive impact on the inflation numbers."" Furthermore, Shah added, ""statistics on India's trade balance will be closely monitored as this statistic clocked a record high in May 2022. The movement of rupee against the dollar will also be kept an eye on. Amid increasing macro uncertainties, investors are advised to exercise extreme caution till markets decisively find their direction."""

Over this period, global markets, especially technology stocks, have also corrected sharply. The stock price correction has largely been due to the derating of valuation multiples, as earnings estimates have mostly remained intact or seen minor downgrades.  Brokerage house PhillipCapital believes that a CYTD correction in stock prices, more than factors in the concerns. It foresees a reversal in these stocks soon, and expects handsome returns from current levels. The brokerage has remained positive on the Indian IT sector and maintained Buy ratings on Mphasis (target price of ₹3,560), Mindtree (TP: ₹4,300), Persistent Systems (TP: ₹4,330), LTI (TP: ₹5,400), Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) with target price of ₹4,270 and Infosys (TP: ₹1,930) as its top stock picks.

In fact, both have traversed the exact same path in the last five months,"" the note stated. ""While the global macro fears are for real, we believe their impact on earnings will be minimal and temporary. The demand outlook continues to be super-bullish – by Gartner, ISG, Accenture and Infosys/HCL (in their recent analyst meets).

Infosys is the vendor that has developed the new e-filing portal for the IT department. Right after its launch on June 7 last year, the e-filing portal faced numerous glitches in its functioning.

Despite the recent sharp correction seen in IT stocks, Indian IT companies are still trading at around 40% premium to pre-Covid average multiples. Even as the global brokerage has remained underweight on the IT sector, it is overweight on only four Indian IT stocks which are Infosys, Mphasis, Tech Mahindra, Persistent Systems (PSYS). “Overall signings have seen growth slow sharply over the last three quarters, per our analysis. Lastly, our analysis of management commentary this earnings season highlights that descriptions of demand/pipeline/ order book have changed from superlative to positive-comparative suggesting flagging growth ahead,"" the note stated. IT Services remains a late cyclical industry and investors should take positive management commentary bearing in mind the lack of foresight the sector has displayed at inflexion points in each of the past cycles, as per the brokerage. Management commentary on demand, order book and pipeline continues to display a strong growth bias. However, the description adjectives have gone down a notch and IT services companies are late cyclical and have been late to witness demand slowdown. “Number of large deals won and our estimate for overall deal TCV growth on LTM basis has been slowing down over the past few quarters (see Figures 4 & 6). We believe this will reflect in revenue growth slowdown over the course of FY23,"" JPMorgan said in a note on Indian IT and ER&D Services. Earnings in Indian IT Services are at risk from margin pressures and potential growth slowdown. Key debates have been whether the stocks already bake this in, whether there are genuine alternatives for India only investors to IT Services, whether the sector is attractive to buy into again, it added.

Analysts at Jefferies believe Infosys is well positioned to deliver 11/15% CAGR in revenue/EPS over FY23-25 as cloud adoption is still low, low US unemployment rates may spur offshoring and reappointment of CEO for another five years provides confidence in execution.  The brokerage house has reiterated its Buy rating on the IT stock with revised target price of ₹1,830 per share. Though, it sees sharp derating on lower growth as the key risk. Even though Infosys’ revenue growth directionally follows US real GDP growth with a lag, the correlation has been low. Besides, Jefferies models a moderation in Infosys’ US dollar growth from 14% in FY23 to 10% in FY25 which is directionally in line with slower GDP growth.  “With cloud adoption still at sub-40% levels, the current tech spending cycle has more legs in store. Moreover, multi-year low unemployment in the US and potentially weaker economic environment should provide an impetus to outsourcing/offshoring which in turn should drive market share gains for Indian IT/ Infosys,"" the note stated. If macro materially worsens, its impact will likely be seen from 2HFY23. Infosys’ revenue growth and margins in FY23 could be at the lower end of its guidance at 13% YoY and 21% respectively, the brokerage added.  Growth could moderate further to 9% levels in FY24-25, however margins could recover to 21.9% levels over next two years, as demand slowdown may reduce wage pressures, as per Jefferies. Infosys' margin performance in the March quarter was poor on impact from lower utilisation, and also due to client contractual provisions and third party costs. “Infosys will also optimize utilization and offshore mix as they have in the past to support margins. Besides, benefits from improvement in its employee pyramid will flow through in FY23 and FY24,"" the brokerage note said.

Day trading guide for stock market today Speaking on day trading strategy in regard to Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said, ""The near term uptrend status of Nifty remains intact and there is no sign of any reversal yet from the highs. Further weakness from current levels could find strong support around 16,400 to 16,350 levels and the Nifty could show upside bounce from the lower levels. Sustainable upside move of NSE Nifty could only resume above the hurdle of 16,800 levels."" Advising investors to avoid aggressive buying, Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com said, ""The divergence after the recent rally of 1000 points indicates limited upside for the time being, and hence we could see the market resuming its corrective phase. Hence, we advise traders to avoid aggressive buying as an up move led by few sectors or stocks is not a good sign."" He said that traders should also be vigilant on the global markets and the US Dollar index which has shown signs of an up move again after the recent corrective phase. Since our markets have recently seen high negative correlation with this index, any upside move in this index could be a factor to worry for.

Updated: 01 Jun 2022,Digital is gradually changing the nature of deals for IT companies,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/digital-is-gradually-changing-the-nature-of-deals-for-it-companies-11654026807652.html,"BENGALURU : As software services companies help clients accelerate their digital transformation initiatives, the nature of deals is becoming shorter and smaller. Digital projects are aimed at solving specific customer pain points and therefore tend to be smaller in size and value, and of shorter duration than traditional contracts. “Some customers want to introduce a big digital programme, so they break it into smaller programmes and then take it step by step. So, we see a higher percentage of smaller deals in the overall pipeline,"" C. Vijayakumar, chief executive officer and managing director, HCL Technologies Ltd said in a recent interview. “As we see, I think there are lots of mid-sized and large deals as well in the pipeline. We have always enjoyed a very good renewal rate of over 90% in our services business, and it continues to be in that range."" With the overall macro environment beset with various challenges, short-term deals are being increasingly accepted by both clients and vendors. “In our view, clients prefer short tenure digital deals because they can easily track their return on investment with the launch of new platforms or programmes in a phased manner. So, many clients do not opt to launch the entire transformation programme at one go, given the higher risk,"" said Ashis Dash, IT analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. From n software services provider’s point of view, short-term contracts are beneficial given the faster conversion of revenue. “Further, the vendor is able to push for price increase during signing of the next phase of the digital transformation programme based on its understanding of earlier programmes and complexities of the new deals, which would be beneficial in terms of margins for the IT services vendor,"" added Dash. The short-cycle digital deals typically span for about 6-12 months and clients usually choose the existing vendor to execute subsequent phases of its transformation programme. Historically, the software services companies have been organized to deliver large projects at low costs. However, digital projects have opposite characteristics. “These are smaller, complex projects where margins as a percentage of revenue are higher. Digital projects, like consulting projects, are also the gateway to downstream work, which presents larger and longer maintenance opportunities. Digital projects need to be viewed as the tip of the spear in IT, much like consulting projects,"" said Abhisek Mukherjee, co-founder and director, Auctus Advisors. During the March quarter, none of the local software services companies bagged a mega deal worth $1 billion or more. To be sure, the share of digital revenue continues to rise for most of these companies. For Infosys Ltd, revenue from digital business grew 38.8% in constant currency from a year earlier and contributed 59.2% to the total revenues for the quarter ended March. For HCL Technologies, digital or ‘mode 2’ business grew 31.6% in constant currency from a year ago and contributed 27.2% to the revenues for the March quarter. Some such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro Ltd have stopped calling out digital revenues separately as the lines between traditional and digital offerings are getting blurred. Going forward, the share of the digital revenue is only expected to rise. Organizations across industries are adopting digital transformation strategies and quickly adapting to new ways of working to serve their customers. The worldwide IT spending is projected to total $4.4 trillion in 2022, an increase of 4% from 2021, according to the latest forecast by research firm Gartner Inc. The major growth drivers of this massive digital transformation are the adoption of industry 4.0, the use of advanced technologies such as cloud, IoT, big data and analytics, mobility, and social media."

Updated: 25 May 2022,India puts 'new reality' on display with Davos street show,https://www.livemint.com/news/world/india-puts-new-reality-on-display-with-davos-street-show-11653487402332.html,"DAVOS : Bright colours and bold logos proudly signal where India has set up base on the main street in Davos this year, as the country trumpets its pro-business and foreign investment drive. Inside a pavilion on the Swiss Alpine resort's Promenade street beneath an ""India @ Davos 2022"" logo, the federal government served up treats including 'masala chai' tea, 'samosa' snacks and other spicy delicacies. Clustered around it are six Indian states with their own lounges, housed in what are usually high street shops. ""It's an Indian street, it should be called 'Little India'. It shows the country is open for investments,"" said Samir Saran of India's Observer Research Foundation. Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told Reuters that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had suggested bringing states together to showcase unity at the gathering of business and political leaders at the World Economic Forum. ""Investors love this kind of a messaging,"" Goyal said. While India has long had a presence at the World Economic Forum, several officials and attendees from Asia's third-largest economy said it was not previously so prominent. At the government's base, food was being prepared by a team of 15 chefs who were flown in from India, along with 450 kilograms of vegetables and local spices, head chef Guru Nathan told Reuters, as people enjoyed a fragrant morning buffet. ""We were asked to keep the spice moderate so that everyone can enjoy (the food),"" Nathan said. Only a few steps down the road, Indian tech giants Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies have set up their bases close to those of Alphabet's Google, Meta and Intel. One state government official put the number of Indian officials attending Davos at more than 100, with scores of company executives and a handful of startups also present. Goyal estimated overall there would be 200 Indian participants. ""We have record numbers from India,"" Sriram Gutta, head of India agenda at the WEF, said. 'NEW REALITY' Federal ministers have talked about India's economic boom and the opportunities it offers at Davos. Although Modi's government has often faced criticism from foreign companies for announcing policies which they say are protectionist in nature and favour domestic companies, India recently reported its highest ever foreign direct investment inflow, which hit $83.57 billion in 2021-22. After engaging regularly with Indian states on subjects such as agriculture technology, drones and electric vehicles, the WEF has gradually increased the number of invitations to them, Gutta said, adding that they ""will continue to gain prominence"". Even though they are run by different political parties, the states were seeking to project a united image and showcase their respective offerings for businesses, Deepak Bagla, CEO of federal investment promotion arm Invest India, told Reuters. The southern state of Andhra Pradesh signed investment pacts worth a total of $16 billion for investment in renewables at Davos, while one official said Karnataka has held meetings with prospective investors. ""What this street really shows you is the new reality of India,"" Bagla said. This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text."

The correction can be attributed to headwinds of slowing revenue growth, reduced margins, elevated consensus expectations and of course stretched stock valuations, in addition to a weak macro environment. “We do believe valuations have contracted materially, but the price paid for high earnings growth is still elevated. We strongly suggest to investors that deployment in Indian IT services segment should be very slow and gradual as we believe there will be many unknown risks ahead, which might further hamper the valuations,"" the note stated. The start of slowdown induced by central bank policy tightening is already being seen. Among mid-caps, it has retained pecking order: Coforge, MTCL and Persistent Systems. Among large-caps, the brokerage has recommended TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Wipro, Tech Mahindra. It has downgraded Mphasis' shares rating from Buy to Add. Further, given the recent sharp correction over the past month, the brokerage has upgraded its rating on Newgen to Buy. “Emphasis on costs will likely lead to dampening of tech budgets and reduce discretionary spend. Macro factors such as GDP, PMI, S&P 500 revenues and CEO confidence are worsening by the day,"" ICICI Securities added. ""We expect a ‘J line’ curve in cost items in the P&L in FY23/FY24. For example, travel costs, which accounted for 2-3% of revenues, are down to ~0.5% now. Going forward, we will also have to take into account the already high inflation, which might push travel costs (and other costs too) way higher than pre-covid levels,"" it added. ICICI Securities still believes the fallen stock prices have not yet fully captured all the headwinds on growth and margins.

This is well deserved and on expected lines. Agreed, Parekh, who turns 58 next month, implies that Infosys would need to seek shareholder nod on the continuation of the CEO well over the retirement age of 60 set by the company. That should not be an issue. Infosys’s market cap has more than doubled from $35 billion on 2 January 2018, when Parekh took over, to $78.5 billion as of 20 May. Parekh is only the second CEO in Infosys’s 41-year journey to get a second term. This is because the Bengaluru-based IT services firm had its own system of musical chairs where four of the company's seven co-founders served as the chief executive officer. Infosys’s co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy was the chief executive for the first 21 years before current chairman Nandan Nilekani took over in 2002. The mantle passed to Kris Gopalakrishnan in June 2007 and finally to S.D. Shibulal in August 2011.                  "

However, it was surprising for the traders as IT stocks continues to remain under pressure despite Indian National Rupee (INR) hit its record low against the US Dollar (USD). In last one week, IT majors like TCS, Infosys, Wipro ended in red zone logging weekly loss of near 3 per cent. MindTree share price shed near 2 per cent last week. However, Birlasoft shares surged around 4.50 per cent in last 5 trade sessions. Explaining why IT stocks are under pressure despite weak rupee, Ravi Singh, Vice President & Head of Research at Share India said, ""IT stocks are witnessing selling pressure as the margins have declined on account of supply side pressures and decline in implementation. As the manpower expense increased, the margins reduced due to higher attrition rates, further resulted to slower growth in profits as compared to revenue growth. Another factor contributing to IT sector fall is the US Fed tightening its monetary policy to fight inflation, putting pressure on US indices and FIIs outflow from Indian markets."" Expecting further falling IT index, Manoj Dalmia, Founder & Director at Proficient Equities said, ""Weakness in IT stocks can be attributed to three major reasons — weak margins and earnings report, higher expenses in terms of hiring and retaining employees due to demand and valuation of IT stocks is currently at about 28 times P/E compared to the past 10 year P/E of 18. We might expect the IT index to fall further till 27500 levels, investors can accumulate quality IT stocks during these falls with long term perspective."" Stocks to buy today On IT stocks that one can think of adding in portfolio at current discounted levels, Ravi Singh of Share India said, ""TCS, Infosys, Mindtree and Wipro are at value buying levels so investors may take long position in these stocks for at least 8-12 months time horizon.""

Sustainability is more important than valuation and not every business is VC'able or can be valued at $10 million, $100 million, or $1 billion, he said in a series of tweets.  There have been concerns that valuations in India are already too high, even when startups' business models are being led by discounts and there is a bleak outlook for revenue. The startup sector has been facing pressure from investors to improve bottom lines and focus on the core business, being asked to lay off employees over the next few quarters. “The focus should be to do whatever it takes to enable entrepreneurs to build resilient businesses at home. So that they create wealth, share it with employees, shareholders, & invest it back in the economy. From Infy (Infosys) to Tatas to tech startups to lakhs of MSMEs,"" Zerodha's Kamath tweeted. ""It is crazy how everyone starting a business today wants to be called a startup, and talk is mostly about overselling market size & valuations, but not about sustainability. I hope this gets corrected in this global reset. We need resilient businesses for India to do well,"" he added. With more than 60,000 startups in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has labelled the current decade a ""techade"", in which he added, ""New unicorns are coming up every few weeks."" However, April was the first month in more than a year that India had no new ‘unicorns’, a term for startups with valuations above $1 billion.  Indian startups raised $5.8 billion in March and April, down about 15% from the corresponding period last year, data from Venture Intelligence shows. In the series of tweets, Kamath said, “The other question for fintechs focusing on investments is how large can the audience that hasn't already invested be? Remember, we've had a bull market, mega ads, freebies, WFH, IPOs, low interest rates, & social media frenzy? If this hasn't got people in, what else can?"""

Updated: 19 May 2022,JPMorgan bullish on these 4 Indian IT stocks,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/stocks-to-buy-jpmorgan-bullish-on-infosys-tech-mahindra-2-other-it-stocks-11652938718865.html,"JPMorgan's top overweight in IT sector is Infosys thanks to growth, Tech Mahindra for 5G cycle and margin expansion, Mphasis and Persistant Systems (PSYS) thanks to more defensive industry exposure and stronger growth outlook. Analysts at the global brokerage believe Infosys’ margin reset is early and calls out sector-wide factors giving it bandwidth to invest and maintain sector-leading growth. “We would Buy the IT stock on weakness for its structural strengths and see limited earnings risk from this level given its guidance track record. It stays the sector bellwether and the best way to play the current tech spending super-cycle, in our view,"" the note stated. On the other hand, JPM expects Tech Mahindra to grow 13% organic constant currency (CC) in FY23 – higher than Wipro (11.4%) and just below HCL Tech (13.2%), as attractively priced while valuations are undemanding. For Mphasis, the brokerage house expects it to be the fastest growing mid-cap IT name whose overall growth will be higher than peers as its headwind from DXC declines sharply. Mphasis’ industry exposure with dominant presence in BFSI makes it more defensive in a rising rates environment. It remains overweight as Persistent Systems' end verticals are the most defensive which can help sustain higher growth even in a macro slowdown. “While bottom-up commentary from Services, Software and SaaS names have remained very positive, macro indicators on Software GDP, US GDP, CEO confidence, and US PMIs have all turned negative,"" JPMorgan added in its note. The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint."
Updated: 18 May 2022,"LIC shares a decent investment opportunity despite tepid debut, here's why",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/lic-shares-a-decent-investment-opportunity-despite-tepid-debut-here-s-why-11652883891219.html,"  The largest insurer Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) is struggling to record a valuable upside on stock exchanges after listing on a discounted note. On Wednesday, the shares traded on a flatter tone as investors expressed lackluster sentiments. Yet, the government-owned insurer has made its way to the list of big boys by holding the tag of the fifth most valued company in terms of market share and also taking the lead in the insurance segment. Despite having a strong market presence, LIC is listed at a discount on exchanges. The real problem for LIC currently was the broader bearish market dynamic not just domestically but also globally as inflationary pressures and monetary policy tightening has unnerved the buying mood. Insurance stocks as well have followed the volatile bandwagon. On Tuesday, LIC was listed at a discount of nearly 9% to ₹867 apiece on BSE compared to the IPO upper price band of ₹949 apiece. On the debut day, LIC touched a 52-week high and low of ₹920 apiece and ₹860.10 apiece respectively. LIC's upper circuit is set at ₹1,051.50 (20%) and the lower circuit at ₹701 (20%). LIC shares are listed on BSE in the ''A'' Group Securities. Shivam Bajaj, Founder & CEO at Avener Capital said, ""Despite the reduction in the pre-IPO valuation of LIC, the scrip has still listed at a discount on the bourses which is in tandem with the diminution in insurance companies’ valuation and softness in the markets due to macro-economic constraints."" Meanwhile, Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, ""The listing price has fallen in tandem with the fall of insurance sector valuations, maintaining the discount of about 70% to the industry’s average. Positively, the stock was brought at the dip."" On Wednesday, the shares witnessed slower traction. It ended at ₹876.25 apiece almost flat compared to the previous day's closing of ₹876.25 apiece on BSE. At the current closing price, LIC holds a market valuation of ₹5,54,227.92 crore. This has made the insurer the fifth largest company on BSE in terms of market cap - surpassing the market cap of ₹5,38,209.12 crore of Hindustan Unilever (HUL). Currently, RIL is the most valued company with a market share of ₹17,17,503.33 crore followed by TCS at second place with a valuation of ₹12,62,006.82 crore, HDFC Bank at the third rank with a valuation of ₹7,29,631.10 crore and Infosys holding the fourth spot with a valuation of ₹6,35,104.25 crore. Despite the tepid listing, LIC has a decent investment opportunity going forward. Bajaj added, ""However, given the attractive fundamentals, stability in operating metrics, and expected recovery in the markets, we can potentially see some buying interest from investors."" According to Nair, ""We believe that LIC is a decent investment opportunity in the short to medium-term considering its strong market presence, improvement in future profitability due to the changes in surplus distribution norms, and strong sector growth outlook. LIC can perform well when we have a bounce in the market and positive performance in the insurance sector."" LIC had planned to raise around ₹21,000 crore from the IPO - becoming the largest ever public offer in the market. The IPO was available from May 4 to May 9. The IPO was oversubscribed by 2.95 times driven by retail, employees and policyholders. Earlier this month, Ajit Kumar Kabi analyst at LKP Research in the IPO note had explained that India’s life insurance industry is expected to grow rapidly, owing to a relatively underpenetrated market and expanding awareness, which presents a multi-year growth opportunity. LIC has been providing life insurance in India for over 65 years and is the country’s biggest life insurer, with a significant brand value advantage. There are concerns about losing market share to private players and having lower profitability and revenue growth when compared to private players. However, we believe that LIC’s distribution advantage, increasing sales mix of direct and corporate channels, and a gradual shift to high margin Non- participating products could be possible drivers for LIC’s future growth, negating lower than industry growth rates. Also, Yesha Shah, Head of Equity Research, Samco Securities had earlier said that the demographical tailwinds, a moderate penetration of life insurance in India, and a massive protection gap, will fuel the Indian life insurance industry's multi-decadal growth. LIC, being the market leader, both in terms of GWP and NBP, is poised to benefit from this growth opportunity. While the fact that LIC has been losing market share as well as it's lower than industry VNB margins do instill apprehension, LIC has indicated its plans to improve the two. The insurance behemoth aims to protect its market share through increased focus on bancassurance and enhancing direct sales of its products on its website. Further, by improving its share of non-participating products and protection plans, it aspires to improve its margins. The long-term direction of LIC’s business and financial performance does hinge on the good execution of these plans.  "

A Mint report on 17 May about Infosys Ltd planning bumper raises and retention bonuses underscores the challenges faced by the industry that is the country’s largest employment generator in the organized sector. Salaries have been rising for techies in the last two years primarily on account of the changing nature of work for technology services companies, and also because of the ill-timed moves by some if not all of them. India’s information technology services sector has about three dozen listed companies and thousands of privately-held firms that Nasscom estimates together did $227 billion in business in the year ended March 2022. The five of the largest homegrown technology services firms -- Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd -- together accounted for about 40% of the country’s $178 billion in IT exports last year. Four years back, in the year ended March 2018, these companies, put together, hired 5,182 employees.           "

Updated: 13 May 2022,"IT/ITes to hire up to 1 mn by end-2023, says industry body",https://www.livemint.com/industry/human-resource/itites-to-hire-up-to-1-mn-by-end-2023-says-industry-body-11652383759868.html,"The domestic IT and ITes industry is set to hire 800,000 to one million people by the end of 2023, according to estimates by the Indian Staffing Federation (ISF), which represents more than 100 recruitment and flexi staffing companies.  The hiring frenzy in the tech sector will continue and it will take at least a year for the attrition to subside as the pressure to poach from rivals abates. “The sector is adding 400,000-500,000 a year and we do not see demand easing soon,"" said ISF president Lohit Bhatia. The tech sector currently employs about 4.5 million people. The industry body, which sees a large portion of the workforce with 0-8 years experience, does not expect any of the tech firms to change their non-compete clauses. “I don’t think any organization would completely open the no-compete clause and allow people to walk away with data and customer information,"" Bhatia said. ISF’s comments come on the back of a Pune-based labour union’s appeal to the Union labour ministry seeking removal of the non-compete clause by IT giant Infosys. The clause, a common practice in the industry, prevents employees from joining a rival firm on similar projects, clients, and geographies. The focus on these clauses come at a time when the tech sector is battling record high attrition. Infosys, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Technologies faced record high attrition levels in the March quarter. Infosys posted an attrition rate of 27.7%, while TCS had an attrition rate of 17.4% during the quarter. Wipro clocked an attrition rate of 23.8%, while that of HCL was 21.9%.  However, ISF’s Bhatia said that the attrition numbers will come down in a year. “Attrition is hovering around 25%. It will ease in a year once tech firms with their hybrid policies hire from smaller towns. This will ease pressure to recruit from rivals in cities,"" he said. The industry body is optimistic that hiring demand will be seen beyond technology as hospitality, aviation and retail sectors return to pre-pandemic levels. Most of the job roles are “covid proof"" where only a few may run the risk of a salary dip, according to a study by recruitment firm TeamLease Services. The Jobs and Salaries Primer FY 2021-22 was done from salary data of 410,000 employees and it showed that salaries grew by a minimum of 4.11 % and a maximum of 10.71% across sectors in FY22."
