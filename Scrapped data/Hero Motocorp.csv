But, this does not mean that investors can expect companies to report stellar earnings for the quarter. Higher cost of commodities such as steel, aluminium and precious metals are likely to compress margins. Price hikes by companies can partly offset this. Kotak Institutional Equities expects Q1 gross margins of most automakers to drop by 50-80 basis points (bps) sequentially. One basis point is 0.01%.           "

Updated: 16 Jun 2022,E-scooter maker Ather Energy tests IPO waters,https://www.livemint.com/industry/manufacturing/escooter-maker-ather-energy-tests-ipo-waters-11655319105445.html,"  Mumbai: Bengaluru-based electric 2-wheeler maker Ather Energy has initiated discussions with investment banks, exploring the possibilities of going public in the near future, said two people aware of the development, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Ather is one of India’s leading electric two-wheeler companies, founded by Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain in 2013. “Ather has met a few of the major domestic and foreign investment banks in recent weeks to discuss the feasibility of an IPO. These are very preliminary talks and they are trying to understand what valuations they can expect if they were to go ahead with an IPO in the coming quarters, as early as end of the year, but most likely in the first half of next calendar year,"" said the first person cited above. “Since talks are at a very early stage it is possible that Aether may not go ahead with an IPO at this point of time, given the current market conditions. Tech stocks have taken a beating in the recent market corrections caused by rising interest rates in the US and other major economies and investors are not too excited about tech IPOs right now. But still, a few consumer focused brands such as Ather have started engaging with banks on their IPO plans,"" the first person added. A spokesperson for Ather said that the company has no plans for an IPO this year. Last month Ather raised $128 million in its Series E round of funding from National Investment and Infrastructure Fund Ltd’s Strategic Opportunities Fund and Hero MotoCorp, which is a significant shareholder of Ather, valuing the company a little shy of $1 billion. The company said that it will use the funding to expand manufacturing facilities, invest in research and development, charging infrastructure and to grow its retail network. “After a strong start to the year, the company registered the highest ever monthly sales in April 2022 delivering 3,779 units to customers. Booking orders for Ather Energy’s flagship product, the Ather 450X is growing at 25% quarter-on-quarter. Ather Energy already has a robust retail sales network across the country, with presence in 32 cities with 38 Experience Centres and aims to expand to 150 Experience Centres in 100 cities by 2023,"" the company said in a press statement announcing the fundraise. In an interaction with Mint, Mehta added that Ather will use this investment to scale up production capacity at its second manufacturing plant, which is expected to go on-stream in a “few months from now"", and have a production capacity of 35,000 units a month. Ather’s existing production facility has a monthly production of only 10,000 units a month, whereas demand for Ather’s scooters is already in excess of 10,000 scooters a month, Mehta told Mint. The electric 2-wheeler market is growing and evolving very fast with several competitors such as Ather, Ola Electric, Bajaj Auto, Revolt Motor, Hero Electric, TVS Motor, Okinawa and Ampere, besides several other small players. India’s largest 2-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp also plans to enter the space later this year. “Given the competition in the space and evolving regulations, especially around batteries, following the recent spate of safety issues, any serious player in the electric 2-wheeler space will need deep pockets to invest in product development, especially the new age players who don’t have legacy pan-India distribution networks. Going public could help provide Ather access to large pools of capital that are focused on ESG and green investments,"" said the second person cited above."

Updated: 06 Jun 2022,"Electric 2-wheeler sales see dip, industry says temporary blip",https://www.livemint.com/auto-news/electric-2-wheeler-sales-see-dip-industry-says-temporary-blip-11654451798707.html,"Registration of electric two-wheelers declined 20% from April to 39,339 in May after a surge in month-on-month sales, according to vehicle registration data on the VAHAN portal. While industry experts said the fall in registrations in a growing market, especially with demand outstripping supply for most vehicle segments, points to muted sentiment, it may be temporary and will not last beyond June-July. Some experts said several factors, such as supply chain disruptions, and safety concerns over EV batteries and the build quality of existing products have forced manufacturers to reassess the standards of their products, following instances of two-wheelers catching fire. Besides, e-scooter companies are also cautious as the EV battery and safety standards are likely to be rolled out soon. “There is some apprehension in the buyers’ minds due to the numerous instances of quality issues and fires in EVs that have been reported recently. While this may not cause a lasting slowdown in demand, there has been a small dip as some customers are choosing to delay purchases, awaiting clarity from the government and OEMs in terms of adherence to the new battery safety rules"", Vinkesh Gulati, president, Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations of India, said in an interview. Hero Electric, which occupied pole position in electric two-wheeler sales till a few months ago, slid to the fifth spot in May, with 2,849 registrations. “April was a washout month for us. We could resume production only by 15 May. It took one-and-a-half month to tide over the supply chain issues we were facing. We uprooted and re-laid our production lines, and have now reached a capacity of 200,000 units. We will be back to being the top player in the market next month onwards,"" Sohinder Gill, chief executive, Hero Electric, said. “There was a small dip in walk-ins for the industry in the aftermath of the fire incidents, but all leading OEMs have waiting periods now and demand continues to be strong,"" Gill added. In May, leading OEMs, barring Ather Energy, Bajaj Auto and Revolt Motor, showed a decline in registrations. Ola Electric, which is one of the top two players in the electric two-wheeler market, saw registration fall 28%. TVS Motor registrations were down 69%, Hero Electric 57%, Okinawa 16% and Ampere 11%, according to the VAHAN data, compiled by Elara Capital. Electric vehicle penetration as part of total two-wheeler registrations in May stood at 3.2%, compared to 4.1% in April. “Company-wise outperformers and underperformers would vary based on which company is able to ramp up capacity,"" Jay Kale, senior vice president, Elara Capital, said. Hero MotoCorp, India’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer, announced last week that it was postponing plans to roll out its first electric two-wheeler, by a few months and it will hit the market during the festive season, citing a semi-conductor shortage. “E-two-wheeler volumes dipped month-on-month on absolute basis and contribution to two-wheeler volumes. It could be attributable to chip shortages resulting in supply constraints, and softening demand after a number of fire incidents. The government’s stand on battery standards for safety and the OEMs’ response to the added safety and testing requirements will be keenly watched in the coming months,"" Kale said."
Updated: 03 Jun 2022,"Third-party insurance premium hike may hit 2W sales, but there's a silver lining",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/thirdparty-insurance-premium-hike-may-hit-2w-sales-but-there-s-a-silver-lining-11654240361936.html,"The demand in the two-wheeler (2W) industry is slowly recovering on the back of improvement in rural markets and the ongoing wedding season. Amid this, an increase in third party insurance rates could weigh on affordability. Note that the cost of owning a 2W has been on the rise. In April 2020, the transition to stringent emission norms prompted 2W makers to hike prices. In recent quarters, companies resorted to increase in prices to pass on the elevated commodity costs. Also, higher fuel prices have not offered any respite. Vikram Kasbekar, executive director at Hero MotoCorp Ltd notes that increase in the third-party insurance rates at a time when the industry has just started to recover would adversely impact customer sentiments as this will further increase the upfront costs of 2Ws in India. Recall that in September 2018, changes in motor insurance policy for new 2Ws resulted in a significant increase in the cost of acquisition. But this time around there is a silver lining. The rates have been hiked only for the vehicles in the premium category which is over 150cc (cubic centimeters). There has been no hike in third-party insurance rates for the entry-level vehicles (75cc-150cc), which constitutes the largest portion of the 2W domestic market in terms of volumes. Note that rates have been hiked for 2Ws less than 75cc but there are no key products in this segment available in the market. Further, the increase in on-road price for a 250cc motorcycle due to the rate hike is less than 1%, according to ICRA Research. “As demand remains fragile, a further increase in the cost of acquisition could have constrained demand recovery for 2Ws in the near term. In this regard, the fact that the entry-level 2W segment has been left out of the insurance price hike, comes as a relief for the industry,"" said ICRA in a press release. Going ahead, the reopening of colleges and offices would boost demand for 2Ws. Also, the expectations of normal monsoon is likely to keep rural demand firm. However, semiconductor shortage and inflationary pressures continue to remain causes of concern."

While the company initially set the launch date for March, it is now planning to hit the market in the run up to the festivities. “(We) remain committed to bring the best of EVs for our customers. The geopolitical situation has resulted in enormous supply chain issues and shortage of components like semiconductors. Keeping customers as the top-most priority, we feel it will be prudent to unveil the EV in the upcoming festive period instead of July,"" said Swadesh Srivastava, head, emerging mobility business unit, Hero MotoCorp. The company had set up its clean mobility unit to roll out the e-scooters under the Vida brand from its facility in Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh. Electric two-wheeler sales declined by 20% month-on-month in May following incidents of fire and other battery-related issues."

Besides, better finance options could also aid in the sales growth going ahead, he added. ""So I think the fundamental growth levers remain intact. How fast it happens, we will have to see,"" Gupta said."
Updated: 13 May 2022,"Ather Energy taps NIIF, Hero MotoCorp",https://www.livemint.com/auto-news/ather-energy-taps-niif-hero-motocorp-11652380044319.html,"NEW DELHI : Tiger Global-backed Ather Energy has raised $128 million ( ₹990 crore) in a fundraising round led by quasi-sovereign wealth fund National Infrastructure Investment Fund (NIIF) and existing backer Hero MotoCorp Ltd in a boost to the electric scooter maker’s ambitious expansion plans. Of the total, Hero MotoCorp has invested $56 million (about ₹420 crore) as the country’s largest two-wheeler maker deepens its presence in green mobility. NIIF contributed most of the remaining investment. Other existing investors in Ather, including angel founders, also took part through minor investments. Ather is also backed by the founders of Flipkart Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal besides Hero and Tiger Global. Hero has been an investor in Ather since October 2016 when it had committed an investment of up to ₹205 crore for a 26-30% stake in the electric scooter maker. The latest round marks the debut of infrastructure-focused NIIF in the new-age manufacturing sector in India. “The EV (electric vehicle) has changed dramatically over the last two years and we need to invest to fuel growth a little ahead of time now,"" Tarun Mehta, co-founder and chief executive, Ather said in an interview. “We will need to raise more capital and I see a capital raise once again in the next two years. Given our pace of growth, we want to stay ahead of the curve and will need to raise more money,"" he added. Meanwhile, Ather has still to turn a unicorn post the new fundraise. A unicorn refers to startups valued at $1 billion or more. Mehta did not disclose Ather’s latest valuation. “I believe there is a lot more value in the company. We did our last round of funding at quite a discount because of covid-19, so we have a lot of upsides left for our investors,"" he said. Mehta termed NIIF’s maiden investment in new-age manufacturing as a major boost to Ather. “We were keen to get NIIF on-board for the longest time and are very happy with the quantum of their investment too,"" he said. Hero MotoCorp will now own a 35% stake in Ather on a fully diluted basis. Stakes of other investors including NIIF and Mehta could not be immediately ascertained. Mehta said the investment will be used to scale up production capacity at its second factory, which is expected to open in a few months with an initial capacity of 35,000 scooters a month. Its existing factory can produce up to 10,000 scooters a month. Both plants are located in Hosur, Tamil Nadu. Ather will use bulk of the fresh fundraise to build capacity at the supply-chain level. “We buy very few components off-the-shelf. We are investing significantly into scaling up not our own capacity, but in scaling up our supply chain as we require a lot of custom-designed parts, custom tooling,"" said Mehta. Ather also plans to invest in building new vehicle and engineering platforms."

Hero MotoCorp has invested $56 million or roughly ₹420 crore in this round, with the rest of the investment primarily coming from NIIF. Other existing investors in the company, including angel founders, also supported the round through minor investments. However, even after this latest fundraise round, Ather Energy's valuation is still shy of $1 billion. ""The EV industry has changed dramatically over the last two years and we need to invest to fuel growth a little ahead of time now. We will need to raise more capital and I see a capital raise once again in the next two years. Given our pace of growth, we want to stay ahead of the curve and will need to raise more money"", Tarun Mehta, co-founder & CEO Ather Energy told Mint. ""I believe there is a lot more value in the company. We did our last round of funding at quite a discount because of Covid-19, so we have a lot of upside left for our investors"", Mehta told Mint. Mehta added that the NIIF investment is a major shot in the arm for the company, as the sovereign's fund's maiden investment into new-age manufacturing. ""We were keen to get NIIF on-board for the longest time and are very happy with the quantum of their investment too. Being a sovereign fund, they are far more patient, understand long-term value creation and are driven by more secular trends"", Mehta said, adding that he is confident NIIF will also support Ather Energy in its future fundraise rounds. Hero MotoCorp will own 35% stake in Ather Energy on a fully diluted basis, after this round of fundraise. Mehta said that Ather will use this investment to scale up production capacity at its second manufacturing plant, which is expected to go on-stream in a ""few months from now"", and have a production capacity of 35,000 units a month. Ather's existing production facility has a monthly production wherewithal of only 10,000 units a month, whereas demand for Ather's scooters is already in excess of 10,000 scooters a month, Mehta said. A significant part of the investment Ather has raised will be utilized towards capacity building at the supply-chain level. ""We buy very few components off-the-shelf. We are investing significantly into scaling up not our own capacity, but in scaling up our supply chain as we require a lot of custom-designed parts, custom tooling. This capacity needs to go upto 1 lakh a month"", Mehta told Mint. He added that a ""realistic"" estimate of being able to attain a capacity of 1 lakh/month capacity is before the end of next year, ""which is still 18 months out"". Mehta expects demand to reach 35,000-40,000 units a year by the end of the year. Ather Energy is also looking to expand its footprint of experience centres to 100 showrooms by the festive season this year. Mehta expects Ather to achieve 10,000 units in sales a month by this time, up from a current run-rate of nearly 4,000 vehicles a month. Additionally, Ather is also going to invest in building new vehicle and engineering platforms. This year, Ather Energy will focus on bringing out ""scooter platforms beyond the Ather 450X."" Ather's 450X is the company's flagship scooter. Mehta, however, clarified that a new motorcycle platform is not in the works yet, at least until this year."
Updated: 06 May 2022,TVS Motor races ahead of its peers in March quarter,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/tvs-motor-races-ahead-of-its-peers-in-march-quarter-11651819197940.html,"TVS Motor Co. Ltd has beaten peers Bajaj Auto Ltd and Hero MotoCorp Ltd on revenue growth and Ebitda margins in the March quarter (Q4FY22). Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. TVS saw 4% year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in standalone revenue to Rs5,530 crore. Net realization improved by 12.5% y-o-y led by price hikes and favorable mix, though this was partly offset by an 8% y-o-y drop in volumes. This is in sharp contrast to the 8% and 14.6% drop in Bajaj Auto’s and Hero MotoCorp’s Q4 revenue, respectively. While the former’s volumes were heavily impacted by semiconductor shortage, the latter was affected by slowdown in the entry segment. Further, TVS’ Ebitda increased by 4% y-o-y to Rs557 crore. Ebitda margin remained stable y-o-y and sequentially at 10.1% as decline in gross margin by 81 basis points (bps) y-o-y was offset by the drop in other expenses. One basis point is 0.01%. Note that Bajaj Auto (adjusted) and Hero reported a 84bps and 279bps y-o-y decline in Q4 Ebitda margin, respectively. “Diversified domestic portfolio, rising export mix and success in premium two-wheeler (2W) segment continue to drive TVS’ Ebitda growth superior to its peers,"" said analysts at ICICI Securities in a report on 6 May. The share of exports rose to 37% in Q4FY22 from 35% in Q4FY21. Automakers are facing the heat from rising commodity costs and have resorted to price hikes. In a post-earnings call, TVS said that it took price hikes of 1.5% in Q4. Moving ahead, the company expects input costs to rise further and in response there would be further price hikes. While this would weigh on demand, the expectations of a normal monsoon and waning covid cases mean the outlook for FY23 is positive. The chip shortage, which impacted production in its premium portfolio in Q4, is also foreseen to ease gradually. On the electric vehicle (EV) front, its product, TVS iQube has more than 12,000 pending bookings, as per the management. It plans to expand production capacity to 10,000 units per month by the end of Q1FY23. Further, it also aims to launch electric 2W and three-wheeler in the coming quarters. While this is encouraging, the company will have to step up its EV portfolio amid increasing competition intensity. It should be noted that TVS derives a significant portion of its revenue from ICE (internal combustion engine) scooter business which makes it vulnerable to increasing EV adoption. “We raise our FY23 earnings per share estimate by 13% to reflect the increase in prices and some recovery in domestic demand. We maintain our FY24 estimate. We maintain our neutral rating, with a target price of Rs650 per share, as valuations fairly capture the expected strength in earnings growth and the risk of an EV disruption to its scooter business,"" said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services in a report on 6 May. Shares of TVS were trading flat on Friday, a day when the benchmark Nifty 50 index was down 1.6%. In the past one year, TVS’ shares have been flattish, whereas those of Bajaj Auto and Hero have declined by 11% and 13.4%, respectively.  "
Updated: 05 May 2022,Hero MotoCorp sees a bumpy ride in Q4,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/hero-motocorp-sees-a-bumpy-ride-in-q4-11651730925036.html,"Automakers are facing the double whammy of rising input costs and subdued demand. In response to battle the higher commodity costs, automakers are resorting to price hikes, which is further weighing on demand. Hero MotoCorp Ltd in its March quarter (Q4FY22) earnings call said that it has raised prices by Rs1,000 per unit in April which is over and above the significant price hike taken in FY22. Note that in FY22, even as net realization rose by 11.2% year-on-year (y-o-y), it could only partially offset the y-o-y volume decline of 14.6% in FY22 with standalone revenue from operations falling by 5% y-o-y to Rs29,246 crore. In Q4, net realization rose by 12.7% y-o-y led by price hikes, favourable mix and higher share of spare revenue. But a fall in volumes by 24% y-o-y meant a decline in standalone revenue by 14.6% y-o-y to Rs7,422 crore. However, cost savings program led to 17% y-o-y and 8% sequential rise in gross profit per vehicle to Rs19,172. Nevertheless, increase in other expenses led to a drop in Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) per vehicle by 10% y-o-y and 6% sequentially. Ebitda margin fell by 279 bps y-o-y to 11.2%. Going ahead, demand is likely to recover given the upcoming marriage season. The management expects the industry to grow by double digits in FY23. True, there is a benefit from the low base in FY22. In April, Hero MotoCorp’s volumes rose by 12% y-o-y but declined by 7% sequentially. Further, the rural market is likely to recover with the expectations of normal monsoon and rising exports of wheat amid geopolitical tensions. “Hero is a good proxy on a rural market recovery, with its stronghold being the 100cc (cubic centimeters) motorcycle segment. It has low vulnerability to EVs, as it garners just 8% volumes from scooters and its core 100cc motorcycle is less prone to EVs"" said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services in a report on 4 May. Even so, rising fuel prices and commodity costs are concerns for mass-market two-wheelers. On the electric vehicle (EV) front, it expects to launch its first EV in July. The management said that it will also launch a vehicle based on technology from Gogoro in FY23. In Ather Energy, Hero MotoCorp has made additional investments thereby strengthening its EV strategy. “Our target price of Rs2,720 is based on 12 times FY24 price to earnings ratio (previously 13x), as we believe a re-rating will depend on EV execution"" said analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) in a report on 4 May. Shares of Hero MotoCorp have increased by 2% in the calendar year 2022 so far."
Updated: 05 May 2022,"Rains, weddings could lift two-wheeler demand in May",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/rains-weddings-could-lift-two-wheeler-demand-in-may-11651693081546.html,"NEW DELHI : Two-wheeler (2W) makers are betting on the forecast of a normal monsoon season and the ongoing wedding season for a revival in demand for vehicles, companies said. On Tuesday, Hero MotoCorp, the country’s largest two-wheeler maker, reported a nearly 30% decline in profit for the quarter ended March to ₹627 crore owing to subdued demand. The two-wheeler maker said it expects retail demand for motorcycles and scooters to rebound in the coming months, with the economy picking up. A normal monsoon, as forecast, is likely to aid a good harvest, which is expected to improve cash flows in rural areas, Niranjan Gupta, chief financial officer of Hero MotoCorp, told analysts in a conference call on Wednesday. “We expect the May-June marriage season demand to be very robust. Festive season pickup was quite decent during Akshaya Tritiya, Gudi Padwa and Ugadi,"" Gupta said, and added the company expects the two-wheeler industry to report double-digit growth in FY23. In FY22, two-wheeler dispatches fell 11%, hitting their lowest level in a decade. Total sales declined to just over 13 million units, significantly below the record 21 million sold in 2019, according to data compiled by the Society for Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). While Hero MotoCorp expects two-wheeler growth to revive, rival Bajaj Auto was more cautious about the demand outlook. “The current demand in two-wheelers is driven by the marriage season in north India, but demand in the second quarter of FY23 will determine the sustainability of demand in the industry at large,"" Bajaj Auto management told analysts at a conference call last week. “We see some recovery in two-wheeler sales in April, but total industry volume is still significantly below pre-covid levels, and full-blown recovery has still not happened. However, improving tractor demand and farmer incomes give hopes of a recovery coming sooner rather than later. We still maintain our two-wheeler industry growth for FY23 at 12%,"" said Jay Kale, an analyst at Elara Capital. Bajaj Auto said uneven economic recovery remains a risk to revival in demand. “Economic recovery is not evenly spread across the lower-income groups, which constitute most of our customers. 70% of our customers earn less than ₹40,000 a month, and almost 60-65% do not have income proof. That is the type of customer we are talking about. And the continued underperformance of the two-wheeler segment demonstrates that this class of customers has been significantly weakened after covid-19. Actually, the signs were there even before covid. So this is a 10-year low for the industry,"" said Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto. He added that galloping inflation is likely to dampen demand further, though the next couple of months will see good retail because of festive season demand."

While concerns related to high input costs continue to remain a challenge, we will keep monitoring the situation and take judicious measures as appropriate,"" said Hero MotoCorp CFO Niranjan Gupta. Standalone net profit stood at ₹627 crore for the March quarter, down 28% compared with ₹869 crore in the last year period. Revenue from operations too fell 14% to ₹7,422 crore during the fourth quarter. On Monday, Hero MotoCorp scrip was down 1.06% to close at ₹2,480.05 on NSE. The company's board has recommended a final dividend of ₹35 per share subject to approval of members. “With the economy picking up, we expect the demand for motorcycles and scooters to see a positive turnaround in the coming months.

The company has sold 11.9 lakh units of motorcycles and scooters sold in the January-March period, down 24% year-on-year. ""The forecast of a normal monsoon is likely to aid the crops, which in turn is expected to improve cash flows in rural sector. All these factors are likely to help in a steady recovery in consumer sentiments and market demand. In FY’23, we have lined up multiple product launches in different segments with an aim to continue building our premium portfolio as well as premiumization of existing models, which will help us deliver growth and profitability,"" Niranjan Gupta said."

Domestic share markets started off May on a tepid note, ending lower on Monday. Losses were largely led by auto, IT and capital goods stocks, while weak global cues added to the pressure. In Europe, stocks were mixed Monday and the dollar was steady as worries over high inflation, tightening monetary policy and China’s Covid lockdowns contributed to investor caution. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index followed Asian stocks lower in sessions affected by holiday closures. U.S. futures rose after April’s slump, among the worst since the pandemic roiled markets in 2020. Back home, the Sensex fell 84.88 points, or 0.15%, to end the day at 56,975.99, while Nifty fell 33.40 points to 17,069.10. About 1,201 shares advanced, 2,180 declined, and 175 were unchanged. Capital goods, auto and IT indices fell a percent each. Midcap and smallcap indices also ended in the red.   Sri Lanka has extended a credit line with India by $200 million in order to procure emergency fuel stocks, the country's power and energy minister said on Monday, with four shipments due to arrive in May. Colombo was also in talks with New Delhi over extending the credit line by an additional $500 million, minister Kanchana Wijesekera told a news conference.   German Chancellor Olaf Scholz plans to invite Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as special guest to a Group of Seven leaders’ summit next month as part of an effort to forge a broader international alliance against Russia. Germany, which currently holds the rotating G-7 presidency, will also welcome the leaders of Indonesia, South Africa and Senegal to the gathering in the Bavarian Alps June 26 to June 28, said people with knowledge of the matter. The decision could be announced as early as Monday, when Scholz welcomes Modi for talks in Berlin and a joint German-Indian cabinet meeting. Despite concerns over the prime minister’s reluctance to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a recent jump in India’s fossil-fuel imports from Russia, Scholz decided the G-7 should court India, according to people familiar with the matter.   Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday issued a yellow warning for Northwest India due to a Western Disturbance, soon after the heatwave spell subsided across the country. Senior scientist of IMD, RK Jenamani said that there are chances of the heatwave being over in most parts of India, including Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, as per the analysis of IMD today. However, there are chances of a heatwave in West Rajasthan and Vidarbha, but the major heatwave spell is ove   State-owned insurance behemoth LIC has said that it will retain part of its stake in IDBI Bank to reap the benefits of the bancassurance channel. Along with the government, Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) will also divest its stake in IDBI Bank, but may not exit completely, LIC Chairman MR Kumar told PTI in an interview. LIC is currently doing roadshows for its maiden public issue, which opens for subscription on May 4.   Oil prices fell on Monday as concerns about weak economic growth in China, the world's top oil importer, outweighed fears of potential supply stress from a potential European Union ban on Russian crude. Brent crude futures fell 71 cents, or 0.6%, to $106.43 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 70 cents, or 0.6%, to $103.99 a barrel.

We expect RoA profile of 0.6% / 0.7% for FY23E / FY24E. There is turnaround in relevant operating metrics and improved confidence in stability of franchise. Nonetheless, we remain cognisant of risks from delay in resolution of stress pool, net labelled exposure of 5.3%, modest RoE profile during transition and supply overhang post the expiry of lock-in shares. We maintain HOLD with an unchanged TP of Rs14.   European Union energy ministers will meet Monday to discuss Russia’s decision to cut gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland, and debate planned new sanctions over Moscow’s war on Ukraine. The 27 nation-bloc has imposed five rounds of sanctions on Russian officials, oligarchs, banks, companies and other organizations since Russian troops invaded Ukraine in February.   State-owned CIL on Monday said coal supply to the power sector rose 15.6 per cent to 49.7 million tonne last month in the wake of high demand of the dry fuel from electricity generating plants and stressed that it is planning to augment its dispatches further, especially to power plants in the coming months. The statement comes at a time when several parts of the country are grappling with power crisis. ""With the intense demand for coal continuing unabated driven by an upward spiral in the electricity generation, CIL (Coal India) pushed up its supplies to power plants of the country to 49.7 million tonnes (MT) in April'22. This is 6.7 MT more supply compared to April’21 when the power sector’s dispatch was 43 MTs,"" the maharatna firm said. With higher output, CIL is aiming to increase its dispatches further, especially to power plants in the coming months. Coal India, which accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output, is one of the major suppliers of fossil fuel to the power sector.   Outlook & Valuation: At the upper end of the price band the LIC IPO  is offered at P/EV (embedded value) of 1.1x as compared to other large listed private life insurance companies which are trading at multiples of 2.5-4.3x Sep’21 EV. Though there are concerns over LIC regarding market share loss in individual insurance business and historically lower margins, we believe that valuations factor in most of the negatives. Expected improvements in product mix and greater transfer of surplus to shareholders account over the coming years are expected to drive profits from current low levels, which along with cheap valuations provide comfort. The issue is priced in the range of ₹902-949.   European stocks fell in thin trade on Monday, pressured by heavyweights such as Mercedes-Benz trading ex-dividend, while data that signalled a steeper pace of contraction in China's factory activity also dampened risk appetite. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.8%, set to snap a three-day session of gains, although trading volumes were likely thinned by a UK bank holiday. Ex-dividend factors weighed heavily on the STOXX 600, with automaker Mercedes-Benz, healthcare company Bayer , auto parts maker Continental and chemical group BASF all losing their payout attraction.   Mumbai saw a 30% fall in property sale registrations of 11,744 units in April, compared to 16,726 units in March, contributing over ₹738 crore to the state revenue. However, the number of units registered in April 2022 was the best in a decade for the month of April, said property advisory Knight Frank India. Around 55% registrations were in the price band of above ₹1 crore while in terms of apartment size, mid-sized homes (between 500-1000 sq ft) were the most preferred category of property registered during the month. (Read here)   India's electricity demand touched a record high in April as its northern states reeled under the hottest pre-summer months in decades, with a surge in the use of air conditioning triggering the worst power crisis in more than six years. Power demand grew 13.2% to 135.4 billion kilowatt hours (kWh), as the electricity requirement in the north grew between 16% and 75%, a Reuters analysis of government data showed. Electricity use is expected to grow as India's weather office has forecast above normal maximum temperatures over most parts of the west central, northwest, north and northeast.   Mid-size motorcycle maker Royal Enfield, a subsidiary of Eicher Motors, on Monday said it has tied up with Italian riding gear brand Alpinestars to create a riding apparel collection with high protection and performance. Founded in 1963 in Asolo, Italy, Alpinestars is now a world-leading manufacturer of professional racing products, motorcycling airbag protection, high-performance apparel, gear and technical footwear. The partnership aims to provide Indian riders with the essential tools needed to make the best of their adventures, Royal Enfield said in a statement.   Shares of Tata Chemicals Ltd jumped more than 10% in Monday’s morning trade on the National Stock Exchange. This is on a day when the benchmark Nifty50 index was 0.7% down. What gives? The reason is simple. The company announced results for the fourth quarter of FY22 (Q4FY22) on Friday after market hours and performance has exceeded Street expectations. Plus, management commentary has been upbeat.   The company's sales grew 24% year-on-year to 295,308 units in April. Total two-wheelers sales also grew 24% to 280,022 units in April. Domestic two-wheeler sales grew 37% on year 180,533 units last month.   Stable Occupancies Led by Back-to-Office Drive Embassy REIT’s Q4FY22 revenue at ₹749 Cr was in line with our estimate amidst stable occupancies coupled with resilient collections after the pandemic. The occupancy was 87.1% on the total portfolio of 33.8 msf at the end of Q4FY22. Reported NOI margins are 82.4% and EBITDA margins improved to 76.7% due to a fall in indirect expenses. EMBASSY has Leased 2.2 msf at 18% spreads across 47 deals, achieved 14% rent escalations on 7.7 msf across 89 deals for FY22, focused on occupiers from high growth sectors such as SaaS, EV, and E-Commerce. The management has guided NOI of ₹2,710 Cr (on average) for FY23 and NDCF/distributions of ₹2,050 Bn. DPU guidance stands at ₹21.7 per unit for FY23 on a similar base of 948 Mn units. Furthermore, the office leasing momentum continues to grow backed by a healthy return to workplace trajectory coupled with robust hiring by technology and global captive players and record tech investments. The company remains focused on delivering growth to Unitholders and scaling up its industry-leading portfolio.   Gold prices fell on Monday as elevated U.S. Treasury yields pressured demand for zero-yield bullion, ahead of a widely expected big interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve to contain broadening inflationary pressures.  Spot gold was down 0.6% at $1,884.50 per ounce. US gold futures dropped 1.5% to $1,883.30.  The market is concerned that the Fed could be quite hawkish, pricing in a 50 basis point hike, and it could be 75 basis points in July, said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. The U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to begin its two-day meeting on May 3 and announce its decision the next day. U.S. Fed policymakers look set to deliver a series of aggressive rate hikes at least until the summer to deal with rapid inflation and surging labour costs, even as two reports released on Friday showed tentative signs that both may be cresting.   Maruti Suzuki India's Q4FY22 performance was ahead of expectations on the margin front, aided by operating leverage benefits, lower discounts, and price hikes.  With low inventory and a large order book, we expect MSIL to come back strongly in terms of profitability along with volume recovery. Going forward, near-term headwinds of chip shortages weighing on production and commodity cost pressures will weigh on MSIL’s financial performance. We expect margin contraction in H1FY23E and normalization in H2FY23E. We maintain our BUY rating on the stock with an unchanged TP of ₹9,800/share, valuing the stock at 27x its FY24E EPS. The TP implies an upside of 27% from the CMP.   Q4FY22 Results: IndusInd Bank reported a healthy performance. GNPA down 21 bps QoQ to 2.27%. Restructured book down 70 bps to 2.6% Total loan related provisions declined to 3.5% vs. 3.7% QoQ Loan growth up 12.4% YoY and microfinance picked up with 18% YoY while deposits were up 15% YoY NII up 12.7% YoY, NIMs improved QoQ to 4.2%, PAT at | 1361 crore What should investors do? IndusInd Bank’s share price has gained ~1.8x in the past 18 months. We believe the bank will show improved business traction with corporate book adding to the momentum. We retain our BUY rating on the stock Target Price and Valuation: We value the bank at ~1.6x FY24E ABV and maintain a target price of ₹1150 per share.   Factory activity in India picked up last month, bolstered by a solid increase in demand as pandemic restrictions were eased, but rising energy prices pushed input costs to a five-month high, a private survey showed. International demand also jumped robustly to a 9-month high after contracting in March and domestic demand was above average. The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index compiled by S&P Global, improved to 54.7 in April from 54.0 in March.   Wipro Ltd's March quarter earnings were disappointing.  In Q4FY22, IT services revenue grew 3.1% in constant currency (CC) terms sequentially, missing consensus estimate of 3.4%. Ebit margin declined 60 basis points sequentially to 17%. Ebit is short for earnings before interest and tax. One basis point is one hundredeth of a percentage point. Analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd note that Ebit margin is the lowest since 1QFY19 levels impacted adversely by the dilutive impact of acquisitions made by Wipro through the past 18 months.

Wipro’s 4QFY22 IT services revenue grew by 3.1% QoQ/28.5% YoY in constant currency (CC) to $2.7bn, in line with our estimates. Sequential growth came at 3.1% in CC terms, vs. our estimate of 3%. EBIT margin of IT services business is at 17%, broadly in line with our estimate of 17.1%, due to high attrition rate. Net income stood at Rs30.9bn (up 4% QoQ/up 4% YoY), 2.6% higher than our expectation of Rs30.1bn. Nine large deal TCV signed with a combined TCV of over $400mn in 4QFY22. Management guided for 1QFY23 revenue from IT Services business to be at $2.75-2.80bn. This translates into a sequential growth of 1-3%.  We expect the restructuring efforts, which include a simplified operating structuring, step-up in capability upgrade and talent management to bode well for WPRO in the medium term. However, margin pressure would continue. We lower FY23E-FY24E EPS estimates by 6% each, factoring weak margin profile. We retain our BUY recommendation and revise the target price to Rs570 (vs. the prior Rs720) and value the stock at 21x (earlier 25x) FY24E earnings.

With this, India clocked 89.7 million dematerialized (demat) accounts by the end of March 2022, registering a jump of 63% in FY22, data from the Securities and Exchange Board of India showed. In FY21, the demat tally had risen nearly 35% to 55.1 million. The relentless rally in stocks since the outbreak of the pandemic has lured younger and tech-savvy cohorts. (Read here)   Growth in the eight infrastructure sectors of the economy slowed in March after recovering to a four-month high in the previous month after supply-side disruptions caused a contraction in coal and crude oil output and a slowdown in some others. The sectors—coal, crude, natural gas, refinery products, fertilizers, cement, steel and electricity—expanded by 4.3% in March from 6% in February, data released by the ministry of commerce and industry showed on Friday. However, fertilizers, cement and electricity posted a swift recovery.   With the last two weeks of range-bound movement, the daily time frame chart exhibits a ‘Triangle’ pattern and prices are inching closer to their apex point. Hence, the breakout in either direction is imminent. As of now, we expect it to happen in the northward direction where 17400 – 17450 are the levels to watch out for. The moment we surpass this, we could see a lot of individual stocks participating in the next leg of the rally. This view would be negated if the index slides and sustains below the lower range. Most of the key indices are placed at a crucial juncture and they are waiting for some trigger to make a move. We hope to witness a much-awaited breakout in the early part of May which will certainly bring back a wider smile in the traders’ fraternity.   Oil prices fell on Monday in holiday-sapped trade in Asia as concerns about slowing economic growth in China, the world's top oil importer, outweighed fears of potential supply disruptions from a looming European Union ban on Russian crude. Brent crude futures fell $1.21, or 1.1%, to $105.93 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 99 cents, or 1%, to $103.70 a barrel. Markets in Japan, India and across Southeast Asia were closed for public holidays on Monday. Prices fell after China released data on Saturday showing that factory activity in the world's second-largest economy contracted for a second month to its lowest since February 2020 because of COVID lockdowns.   Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange fell 266.50 points, or 1.56%, to 16,860 in early deals on Monday, signalling a weak start for Indian benchmarks. On Friday, the benchmark Sensex fell 460 points to close at closed at 57,060.87, led by losses in banking, IT, and energy shares. The Nifty tanked 142.50 points to end the day at 17,102.55.   Stock markets in Japan, Australia, and South Korea fell on Monday, while US equity futures struggled as high inflation, tightening monetary policy and China’s Covid lockdowns deepened concerns about the global economic outlook.  Markets in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand are closed on Monday for public holidays. S&P 500 futures rose 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.2%.  Japan’s Topix index shed 0.2%, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 1.1%, and South Korea’s Kospi index fell 0.7%. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates by a half point Wednesday, the largest increase since 2000. The question is how high it needs to go to get runaway inflation under control and whether that will trigger a recession. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 900 points as another sharp sell-off led by technology stocks added to Wall Street's losses in April. The benchmark S&P 500 fell 3.6% and finished April with an 8.8% loss, its worst monthly slide since March 2020.  The Nasdaq composite, heavily weighted with technology stocks, bore the brunt of the damage this month, ending April with a 13.3% loss, its biggest monthly decline since the 2008 financial crisis.  "

Sales of the latest month were driven by robust growth in the motorcycles segment. In April 2021, the company's sales stood at 372,285 units. Hero MotoCorp's domestic sales stood at 3,98,490 units in April 2022 - rising by 16.305 versus 3,42,614 units in April last year. Exports witnessed a drop of 32.15% in sales to 20,132 units in April 2022 against 29,671 units in April 2021.

It has already handed over more than 100 such retro-fitted Destini scooters to the soldiers in various states across the country. Further, in April, Hero MotoCorp collaborated with the Automotive Skill Development Council (ASDC) for “Project Jeevika"", to upskill and train two-wheeler market technicians across the country on BS-VI Technology. The company has already trained more than 6000 technicians through TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training) ecosystem. Also, the company handed over 250 Hero Glamour Motorcycles to the Haryana Forest department and Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning (CAMPA) authority to commemorate World Earth Day, this year."
Updated: 22 Apr 2022,Focus shifts on incumbents in electric two-wheelers segment,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/focus-shifts-on-incumbents-in-electric-two-wheelers-segment-11650608491676.html,"Offerings from new-age electric vehicle (EV) startups are proving to be hazardous, with the recent instances of EVs catching fire. Against this backdrop, analysts expect there would be an increased focus on electric two-wheeler products of established, listed entities such as Bajaj Auto Ltd, TVS Motor Co. Ltd and Hero MotoCorp Ltd. “We opine that the incumbents will continue to maintain their dominance even in the new-age EV markets, led by following factors: cost advantage on the back of high scale of operation and efficient procurement; wide distribution network and market reach; technology and R&D capabilities; and investments in EV start-ups,"" said analyst at Nirmal Bang Equities Pvt. Ltd in a report on 19 April. Note that Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor have launched their EVs and are in the process of expanding their offerings to more cities, while Hero MotoCorp is set to launch its electric two-wheeler in July. Even as electric two-wheeler penetration has been going strong, overall demand for two-wheelers has remained muted. Two-wheeler wholesales declined 11% year-on-year (y-o-y) in FY22, marking the third consecutive year fall, note analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 20 April. A weak rural economy and rising inflation are among factors that have been weighing on demand. Also, high fuel prices add to the woes, hitting affordability. According to Jefferies analysts, the share of <125cc vehicles in the March quarter (Q4FY22) declined to 51% from 53% seen over FY18-FY22 while that of >125cc vehicles seem to be inching up. cc stands for cubic centimeters and denotes the volume capacity of the engine. The brokerage added, TVS Motor clocked a decadal high market share of 15% while Hero MotoCorp lost 2.6% market share in FY22. While domestic sales have remained dull, exports have grown 33% y-o-y. In the export market, TVS Motor’s market share stood at 24.5%, a gain of 1.6% while Bajaj Auto lost market share by 4.5% to 49.4%. Note that TVS’s shares have outperformed those of Bajaj Auto and Hero in the past one year. Meanwhile, the likelihood of a timely and normal monsoon is expected to boost the rural economy which augurs well for motorcycle sales, going ahead. Further, the opening of offices and colleges would also support recovery in demand for two-wheelers. Of course, a recovery in volumes would also eventually offer support to profit margins."

The two-wheeler (2W) company operates primarily in the <125cc (cubic centimetres) segment (mostly entry- and executive-level vehicles). These categories have faced the most heat as rising inflation and dull rural demand weighed on motorcycle sales. Plus, soaring fuel prices mean a rise in the cost of ownership of vehicles. Unsurprisingly, Hero’s shares have declined by 19.5% in the past one year, sharply underperforming the Nifty Auto index, which rose by 12.7%.       "
Updated: 12 Apr 2022,Will price hikes save the day for auto companies in Q4?,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/will-price-hikes-save-the-day-for-auto-companies-in-q4-11649745687115.html,"The recovery in demand across different automobile segments has not been uniform in the March quarter (Q4FY22). While the commercial vehicle (CV) segment is seeing a strong rebound in demand, the same cannot be said for two-wheelers (2Ws) and tractors. However, the sequential improvement in 2W and tractor volumes is encouraging.  In the passenger vehicle (PV) segment, easing semiconductor shortage is supporting the gradual improvement in demand. But rising fuel prices is a point of concern, particularly in the 2W and entry-level PV segment as it impacts affordability. Besides, higher raw material costs pose a risk to Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margins of automakers. As such, the companies have resorted to price hikes in Q4 which have shielded them from deterioration in financial metrics to an extent. “Our commodity cost index shows PVs up ~250bp (basis points) and 2Ws up 350bp from Q3FY22 levels. Our analysis of commodity contracts and inventory suggests the impact is not likely to be meaningful in Q4FY22F and may only be visible in 1QFY23F,"" said analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a report on 11 April. One basis point is one-hundredth of a point. According to analysts at Centrum Broking Ltd, the Q4FY22 revenue of Bajaj Auto Ltd and Hero MotoCorp Ltd is expected to decline by 12% and 11% year-on-year (y-o-y) respectively. TVS Motor Co. Ltd revenue is foreseen to rise by 6% y-o-y as TVS volumes were down only by 8% y-o-y as against Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp Q4 volume decline of 17% and 24% y-o-y respectively. Ebitda margins for TVS Motor is estimated to rise narrowly but Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp are expected to report decline in margins by 330bps and 100bps y-o-y respectively. In PVs, the demand in the premium segment such as SUVs has remained intact. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd PV revenues are expected to grow by 16% and 57% y-o-y respectively, according to analysts at Nomura. The CV segment is seeing a strong cyclical upturn which means companies such as Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) and Ashok Leyland Ltd are expected to report 25% y-o-y revenue growth each in Q4, as per Nomura estimates. On the Ebitda margin front, M&M is anticipated to report y-o-y decline of 264bps while Ashok Leyland’s margin is anticipated to remain flattish y-o-y. The tractor segment in M&M is partly impacting the margins. “Overall, in comparison to consensus for original equipment manufacturers, we expect beat for Maruti, M&M and Ashok Leyland but a miss for Tata Motors (Jaguar Land Rover),"" added the Nomura report."

As per the data by FADA, the total retails increased to 4,29,217 units in 2021-22 from 1,34,821 units in FY21--a 3x jump in the sales, the industry body said. According to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), electric passenger vehicle retail sales stood at 17,802 during the last fiscal, up over three-fold from 4,984 units in FY21. As per the FADA data, Tata Motors led the EV segment with retails of 15,198 units and a market share of 85.37%. The Mumbai-based company's retail sales stood at 3,523 units in FY 2020-21.

Updated: 05 Apr 2022,Bajaj Auto's March sales volume worst hit among two-wheeler companies,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/bajaj-auto-s-march-sales-volume-worst-hit-among-two-wheeler-companies-11649139261341.html,"Bajaj Auto Ltd's two-wheeler (2W) volumes saw further decline in March, falling 8% sequentially and 22% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 2.6 lakh units. Subdued domestic demand in the two-wheeler segment coupled with a severe shortage of semiconductors led to a 41% slump in domestic volumes. Flattish exports, however, cushioned some of the fall. Meanwhile, rising fuel prices have been weighing on affordability. Bajaj Auto’s management said overall demand for motorcycles in India remains soft. “With key 2W overseas markets either showing static demand or a declining bias, we expect Bajaj Auto’s 2W export volumes to grow at 8% CAGR in FY22-FY24E,"" said analysts at ICICI Securities in a report on 31 March. CAGR is compounded annual growth rate. To be sure, Bajaj Auto’s peers also saw a year-on-year drop in sales volumes in March, even as they recorded sequential improvement. TVS Motor Co. Ltd reported a 5% y-o-y volume decline in 2Ws while Hero MotoCorp Ltd’s volumes fell 22% y-o-y. However, both saw sequential increases in volumes - by 10% and 26%, respectively. Eicher Motors Ltd's motorcycle volumes (Royal Enfield) rose 2.5% y-o-y and 14% sequentially. Going ahead, rural markets hold the key for two-wheeler demand. As such, dull demand conditions are not the only concern. Rising costs of raw materials such as steel and aluminium are likely to impact margins, and therefore pose a challenge. For Bajaj Auto, “About 15% increase in raw material basket cost would require a price hike of about ₹9000/unit, to keep gross profit/unit neutral,"" added the ICICI Securities report. The majority of cost inflation would get reflected from Q1FY23 onwards. Consequently, analysts at ICICI Securities are reducing earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin estimates for FY23 by about 300 basis points to 14.5%. One basis point is 0.01% Meanwhile, in Bajaj Auto's three-wheeler (3W) business, demand remained firm, with domestic volumes in March rising 15%. Exports fell 4% y-o-y. “We estimate 3W volumes to grow by about 22% y-o-y in FY23,"" said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services in a report on 4 April. After declining nearly 6% in CY21, shares of Bajaj Auto have risen about 17% in calendar year 2022 so far."
Updated: 01 Apr 2022,IT search unearths bogus expenses of over ₹800 cr,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/it-search-unearths-bogus-expenses-of-over-800-cr-11648752108754.html,"NEW DELHI :   The income tax department unearthed several financial discrepancies while conducting searches at a total of more than 35 premises of a leading automobile manufacturer, a company operating chartered flights and a real estate group last week, the finance ministry said on Thursday. The premises were all in the National Capital Region and the searches took place on 23 March. The income tax department did not reveal the identity of the companies. However, according to people aware of the development, the automobile manufacturer is Hero MotoCorp Ltd and the other companies were “connected entities"" of the group. The income tax department said it had found bogus expenses of around ₹800 crore made by the automobile company in the form of purchase of services from a specific event management entity, which had in turn siphoned-off the money by “layering""—the practice of moving funds around in order to conceal their origin. “Various incriminating documents and digital evidence have been found and seized, indicating that expenses ostensibly shown to have been claimed towards business purposes are not fully supported by evidence. Such claims towards non-business purposes are inadmissible expenditure under the provisions of the Income-Tax Act, 1961,"" the IT department said. Mint had reported earlier this week that mismatches between the income declared with the income tax department and information from other sources, including the GST Network (GSTN) may have been the trigger for the massive search and seizure operations at various premises of Hero MotoCorp, which is led by Pawan Munjal. The department found that 10 acres of farmland had been bought through “paper companies"", purportedly involving unaccounted cash of more than ₹60 crore. “The ultimate beneficiary of the land deal is a prominent person of the automobile manufacturer group,"" the department said. The intermediary who facilitated the deal has admitted that the major part of the sale consideration was paid in cash, it said. The I-T department and GSTN signed an agreement in 2019 to facilitate the exchange of data. This was aimed at allowing the I-T department to verify information filed by businesses in their income tax returns (ITRs) by comparing it to the annual GST returns. The department unearthed several incriminating documents from the premises of persons involved in the real estate business, which include records of “on-money transactions"" where cash was received in lieu of sale of units in their various real estate projects across Delhi, it said. “In the case of the company operating chartered flights, evidence related to booking bogus expenses, non-recognition of income of more than ₹50 crore, rotation of funds, suspicious loans through a dubious non-banking financial company floated by a key person, layering and re-routing of funds through paper companies, and claiming bogus interest expenses, have also been unearthed,"" the department said. Investigations are going on, but undisclosed cash exceeding ₹1.35 crore was seized and jewellery worth more than ₹3 crore has been kept “provisionally under restraint"". Queries sent to spokespersons for Hero Motor Corp and the finance ministry did not elicit a response as of Thursday evening. Tax officials had said that information shared by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs with the income tax department “sometime ago"" led to the opening of a probe against the two-wheeler giant."

According to the people mentioned above, information shared by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) with the department “sometime back"" led to the opening of a probe against the Pawan Munjal-led two-wheeler giant. Officials aware of the development said the searches have not only continued for the third day, but its scope has now widened to cover multiple locations. A government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the department has “credible information"" about alleged irregularities that warranted the search and that searches continued on Friday, but declined to confirm or deny if the action could be attributed to information from CBIC. The I-T department and GSTN signed an agreement in 2019 to facilitate the exchange of data. This was aimed at allowing the I-T department to verify information filed by businesses in their income tax returns (ITRs) by comparing it to the annual GST returns. The information exchange between the two authorities under the revenue department is intended at nabbing tax defaulters and evaders. GSTN has a centralized return filing system where businesses have to report their sales and input tax credit details. “The mismatch came to light from the information shared by the CBIC sometime back. We have solid evidence to open the probe. There are multiple gaps and mismatches that were identified during the probe. We have credible information based on intelligence and that’s the reason we did not go for a survey, but a proper search and seizure operation,"" one of the people cited above said, requesting anonymity. The person, however, declined to disclose details of the time and the year the case pertains to and the outcome of the search operation. The tax department has covered more than 25 locations of Hero MotoCorp’s premises since Wednesday, including Delhi and Gurugram and the home of chairman and chief executive Pawan Munjal. A second government official who also did not want to be named said the I-T department initiated the action based on “clear evidence"" of alleged irregularities. The official declined to comment on the quantum of any irregularity or the financial years it may apply to, saying only that investigations are still on. Queries emailed to the spokespersons of the finance ministry, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), and Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) on Thursday remained unanswered till the time of going to press. A spokesperson for Hero MotoCorp did not respond to queries sent on Thursday and Friday on the continuing tax searches but referred Mint to the statement issued by the company on Wednesday. “Officials from the income tax department visited two of our offices in Delhi and Gurugram and the residence of our chairman & CEO Dr. Pawan Munjal on Wednesday. We have been informed that this is a routine inquiry, which is not uncommon before the end of the financial year,"" Hero MotoCorp said in the statement on Wednesday. “We reassure all our stakeholders that it continues to be business as usual. We at Hero MotoCorp are an ethical and law-abiding corporate and maintain the highest standards of impeccable corporate governance. In keeping with this philosophy, we are extending our full cooperation to the authorities,"" the statement added. The second official quoted above alleged that Hero MotoCorp was implying through the press statement that the search operation was carried out as part of a year-end collection drive. “We have already exceeded the collection target for FY22 by ₹1.13 trillion.

Updated: 24 Mar 2022,Low-quality batteries ill-suited to Indian conditions may toughen ride for India,https://www.livemint.com/auto-news/lowquality-batteries-ill-suited-to-indian-conditions-may-toughen-ride-for-india-11648088630150.html,"NEW DELHI: While the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has been picking up in the country, with almost one million units on the road, the peddling of low-quality batteries that are ill-suited to Indian conditions is likely derail the progress of the industry, according to experts and battery manufacturers. Arun Vinayak, co-founder of Exponent Energy, a Bengaluru-based startup that makes battery management systems (BMS) and fast charging interfaces for EVs, points out that ""a lot of mom-and-pop shops around the National Capital Region buy battery cells from third-party vendors, and cover them in blue shrink wraps to create battery packs"". ""These are cheap batteries that target the mainstream e-rickshaws – and come with very basic or no BMS,"" he says. The BMS of a battery is a hardware and software interface that controls power supply to a battery pack’s underlying cells, as well as the charging speed and voltage. It is this that controls the power cut-off point when charging batteries, which is crucial in preventing them from overcharging. This not only helps maintain the claimed longevity of a battery, but also prevents it from exploding. However, if users purchase a battery that is not tested properly, the lack of a BMS when combined with a rudimentary thermal management system will not only pose a risk but also reduce the life of the battery, according to Vinayak. This poses a major problem, particularly considering how Indian road conditions differ from western nations that have cooler temperatures and comparatively smoother roads. “Cells should be between 35 and 45 degrees Celsius, but in India, the ambient temperature itself is above 45 or 48 degrees. This raises the question of keeping the cells below the ambient temperatures, which batteries that are being imported from colder markets today do not come with,"" he adds. With higher ambient temperatures, the lack of a proper BMS and heat management systems make inexpensive battery packs a major safety hazard, while simultaneously reducing efficiency and the life of the battery. “For instance, if you have a faulty or basic BMS, your battery pack may think it is at 30% power and continue to charge, whereas in reality, the cells are already at 100% charge. This can create a big safety issue,"" Vinayak explains. Varun Goenka, chief executive of battery swapping network startup ChargeUp, agrees that Indian road conditions pose challenges for EV batteries. To address the issue, ChargeUp has built its own technology platform wherein it leases batteries, fits them with connected chips, and collects on-ground data when these batteries are in operation in two and three-wheelers. “We run analytics on three years of on-ground EV battery data that we have collected, and select practices to minimise battery performance drops to better adapt them to Indian temperatures. We also charge batteries in an air-cooled environment at our swapping stations,"" Goenka says. However, Rajeev Singh, partner and automotive leader at Deloitte India, points out that India currently has no regulatory body to lay down on-road rules for battery specifications--not just for four-wheelers, but for mainstream e-rickshaws and scooters as well. “Reports from over the past few months stated that there are over 820 e-rickshaw makers in the country. Given that we do not have a body such as the Arai (Automotive Research Association of India) in the EV space, how does one regulate so many companies in terms of adapting safety standards?"" he points out. Further, while large automakers such as Tata Motors and Hero Motocorp have the capital to invest in advanced battery technologies, drivers of e-rickshaws that offer last mile connectivity in both urban and rural areas in India are likely to purchase untested, poor-quality batteries sold by third-party vendors. To be sure, the Indian EV industry is working on addressing these concern areas. Varun Agni, co-founder and head of products and technology at electric scooter maker, Bounce, says while the company imports battery cells from other countries, they have invested in road tests to ensure that the batteries can withstand heat, rough usage patterns and extensive road vibrations. However, he adds that fast charging of EV batteries remains a roadblock in India for now. Ola Electric chief executive of Bhavish Aggarwal has reiterated in his tweets and blog posts that the startup is “investing deeply behind core R&D to create indigenous advanced cell technologies"". Ola Electric has also applied for the Indian government’s production-linked incentive scheme to manufacture battery cells in the country, and on 21 March, announced a partnership with Israel-based fast charging company StoreDot. The latter claims to offer 100% battery power in five minutes in India, which Ola Electric has said will be brought to the market, “soon."" Singh, on his part, insists that ""India needs its own testing standards since most cells and batteries are made in colder countries. As we pack batteries more densely, we need to ensure that adequate BMS units are put in them. Regulatory recommendations can help mandate that."""

They’re going to go spend it, so I don’t see the demand destruction at these prices."" Oil was already elevated before Russia invaded Ukraine as supply struggled to keep up with the demand rebound from the pandemic. The ensuing financial penalties on the country, one of the biggest crude producers, and self-sanctioning by much of the industry saw Brent -- the global benchmark -- flirt with $140 a barrel in early March, although it’s now eased back to near $115.   Oil prices rose on Wednesday as a reported drop in U.S. crude inventories increased concerns about tight global supplies amid the hit to Russian exports from economic sanctions. Brent crude futures climbed $1.77, or 1.53%, to $117.25 a barrel, after falling 14 cents in the previous session. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose $1.51, or 1.38%, to $110.78 a barrel, after losing 36 cents on Tuesday. The market remains on edge over the prospect of further sanctions on Russia, the world's second-largest crude exporter, after its invasion of Ukraine, actions that Moscow calls a ""special operation"". Prices dipped on Tuesday as the European Union seems unlikely to agree to a ban on Russian oil. However, U.S. President Joe Biden is set to announce more sanctions on Russia when he meets with European leaders on Thursday in Brussels, including an emergency meeting of NATO.   Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. Ltd on Tuesday said it has temporarily stopped existing investments including, systematic investment plan (SIP) and systematic transfer plan (STP), into its S&P 500 Index Fund, MSCI EAFE Top 100 Select Index Fund and Nasdaq 100 Fund of Fund from 1 April 2022.

Tuesday's outage also affected Mac App Store, users of Apple Card, Apple Books, iCloud Web Apps and Weather. The outage on Monday affected 11 of Apple's services, including Arcade and Maps. It was not immediately clear what caused the outages on both days, but Bloomberg News reported on Monday that Apple told staff that the outage stemmed from domain name system, or DNS - an address book of the internet which enables computers to match website addresses with the correct server.   One97 Communications Ltd., parent of Paytm, on Wednesday said there was no information to be disclosed which may have a bearing on the price/volume of shares of the company. It added that business fundamentals remain robust.  BSE had sought clarification from One 97 Communications Ltd. on the steep fall in the company’s shares. On Tuesday, Paytm shares fell 3.8% to ₹543.90 on BSE. They are now down 75% from the issue price of ₹2,150 apiece.   For today's session, 17350 followed by 17500 are the levels to watch out for; whereas, on the flip side, 17150 – 17000 are to be considered as intraday supports. On Tuesday, market breadth was extremely positive in the latter half and the broader market did extremely well along with some heavyweights. Hence, traders are advised to remain sanguine and focus on individual stocks in order to identify better trading opportunities.   Novavax Inc said on Tuesday its COVID-19 vaccine has got emergency-use authorization from the Drugs Controller General of India for children aged 12 to 17 years. The authorisation is a global first for the age group for the vaccine, which is manufactured and marketed in India by the Serum Institute of India under the brand name Covovax.   Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s (HUL’s) investors are nervous. The relentless rise in costs for fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies has come at a time when demand environment is sombre. Some companies are likely to be more hurt than others, and HUL’s relatively high exposure to raw materials such as palm oil, and crude oil and its derivatives makes it more vulnerable given the surge in prices following the war in Ukraine. These concerns are reflected in the stock’s performance. HUL’s shares have declined 16% so far in CY22 vis-à-vis a 4% drop in the Nifty FMCG index. The stock is now trading at 40 times estimated FY24 earnings, according to Bloomberg data. Valuations have corrected meaningfully but the scope for significant near-term upsides appears capped.

Executives of the fuel retailers said more such hikes are likely as Brent crude prices have surged more than 40% since November. In the national capital, diesel and petrol were sold at ₹87.47 per litre and ₹96.21 per litre, respectively, on Tuesday. The retailers also raised the prices of non-subsidized cooking gas cylinders by ₹50 after a gap of over five months. This is the first hike since 6 October last year.

The overall chart pattern indicate next upside of around 17,500 for NSE Nifty in the short term and one may expect further upside targets of around 17,800 to 18,000 levels in the near term.   Similar to Monday’s session, we had a soft opening on Tuesday as indicated by the SGX Nifty. In the initial hours, the weakness extended as we witnessed some decent correction in the financial space. As a result, Nifty gradually approached its psychological level of 17000 in the first half. However, all of a sudden the buying re-emerged from nowhere and within a blink of an eye, markets were off significantly from day’s low. The buying momentum accelerated towards the fag end to not only erased all losses but also to close above 17300 with more than a percent gains. During the first half of Tuesday, we witnessed extension of Monday's profit booking mode but as we approached the sacrosanct support of 17000 – 16900, the bulls got activated all of a sudden. Since there was no unfavorable trigger on the domestic as well as global front, the bulls grabbed this opportunity with both hands. Initially, Reliance and IT pack was providing some helping hand and banking was sulking; but the moment market reversed, the banks came back in the driver’s seat to lift the overall sentiments of the market participants. With reference to our previous commentary, we were pretty clear that this is just a profit booking phase and the buying is likely to attract around 17000 – 16900. Markets perfectly moved as per the script and has now closed at an interesting juncture. For the coming session, 17350 followed by 17500 are the levels to watch out for; whereas on the flipside, 17150 – 17000 are to be considered as intraday supports. On Tuesday, market breadth was extremely positive in the latter half and broader market did extremely well along with some heavyweights. Hence, traders are advised to remain sanguine and focus on individual stocks in order to identify better trading opportunities.

A record 137-day hiatus in rate revision ended on 22 Marchwith an 80 paise per litre increase in rates. Prices had been on a freeze since 4 November ahead of the assembly elections in states like Uttar Pradesh and Punjab - a period during which the cost of crude oil soared by $30 per barrel.    Oil prices turned higher on Wednesday, erasing losses from the previous session, after industry data showed U.S. crude stocks fell last week, underlining how tight global supplies are amid the hit to Russian output from economic sanctions on Moscow. Brent crude futures climbed $1.06, or 0.9%, to $116.54 a barrel, after falling 14 cents in the previous session.

Updated: 04 Mar 2022,Hero MotoCorp enters EV sector under Vida brand,https://www.livemint.com/auto-news/hero-motocorp-enters-ev-sector-under-vida-brand-11646417607393.html,"NEW DELHI : Hero MotoCorp Ltd, India’s largest two-wheeler maker, will make its long-awaited entry into the country’s thriving electric vehicle market in July through the Vida brand. The new brand will house the New Delhi-based automaker’s emerging mobility initiatives, including upcoming launches of electric two-wheelers. Customer deliveries of the first product will start later this year. The company will manufacture the electric vehicles at a factory in Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh. Hero MotoCorp had earlier announced plans to launch its first e-scooter in March, but Friday’s announcement confirms that the launch has been delayed by about three months. The news sent the company’s shares lower, tracking a weak Mumbai market. The stock ended 4.32% lower on the NSE, widely underperforming a 1.5% fall in the benchmark Nifty index and a 3.5% drop in the Nifty Auto index. Hero MotoCorp’s announcement also comes amid an ongoing arbitration with rival Hero Electric over the former’s use of the ‘Hero’ brand name for its EVs. Owned by Hero MotoCorp chairman and chief executive Pawan Munjal’s cousin Vijay Munjal and nephew Naveen Munjal, Hero Electric is the country’s largest seller of electric two-wheelers in a market that’s growing at an exponential rate. Last October, Hero Electric approached the Delhi high court, seeking an injunction on Hero MotoCorp from using the Hero name for its upcoming electric two-wheelers. While the court did not grant an injunction at the time, it asked both parties to settle the dispute out of court last month. Two people aware of the developments at the two companies said the launch of the new brand may not mark the end of the arbitration proceedings. Hero MotoCorp had registered the Vida brand name in November last year. The Indian market for electric two-wheelers is growing fast thanks to favourable government policies, improving ownership costs and a range of new product offerings. This as the traditional two-wheeler segment faces significant headwinds amid surging petrol prices and the high initial cost of acquisition. This is prompting legacy two-wheeler makers such as Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, and TVS Motor Corp. to enter this segment. Startups such as Ather Energy, owned more than a third by Hero MotoCorp, and Ampere, Okinawa and Ola Electric currently dominate the electric two-wheeler market. The domestic electric two-wheeler market grew more than 130% to 233,971 vehicles in 2021, according to the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV). Last year, Hero MotoCorp announced a partnership with Taiwanese two-wheeler maker and battery-swapping infrastructure provider Gogoro to jointly develop an EV powered by Gogoro’s swappable solutions for the Indian market and form a battery-swapping joint venture. It is unclear whether the first Vida electric scooter in July will be a direct charging-based solution or one based on a battery-swap solution. Hero MotoCorp’s domestic sales fell 16% to about 4.22 million vehicles in the first 11 months of this financial year through March, according to a company release. “Among two-wheeler OEMs, TVS MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto have launched vehicles but are yet to ramp up production. Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India has announced it will launch an EV only next year"", Jay Kale, senior vice-president at Elara Capital, said, adding that OEMs’ share of this market is likely to change rapidly based on their ability to ramp up capacities. Meanwhile, unveiling the Vida brand at an event in Dubai, Pawan Munjal also announced a $100 million global sustainability fund to establish global partnerships and spearheaded by the automaker and BML Munjal University. “Vida means life, and the brand’s sole purpose is to create a positive impact on the world and move us all forward in meaningful ways ...This is truly the dawn of something special. In only 17 weeks from today, we will unveil our Vida platform, products and services to make the world a better place,"" Munjal said."

It sold 3,38,454 motorcycles and 19,800 scooters during the same period against the 4,63,723 bikes and 41,744 scooters in 2021. Out of the 3,58,254 units sold in Feb 2022, 3,31,462 were sold locally in India while 26,792 were being exported. “With a sharp decline in the number of Covid-19 cases and the economy gradually opening up with several other positive indicators, such as easing of the lockdown restrictions, as well as the measures announced in the FY’23 Union Budget, a swift revival in sales is expected in the coming months,"" said Hero MotoCorp. Similarly, Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India total sales stood at 312,621 units with 285,677 domestic sales as compared to 411,622 last year. Parallely, Honda’s exports for the month stood at 26,944 exports. On the contrary, WardWizard, manufacturers of electric two-wheelers, registers a record sale of 4,450 units of electric two-wheelers in February 2022. This was the highest ever sales in any month for the company. Led by the launch of three new high-speed electric scooters including a fleet management vehicle in the month, the company recorded a growth of 1,290% as compared to February 2021, when the company had sold 320 units of electric two-wheelers. The company further achieved double-digit growth of 12.62% as compared to last month, when the total sales stood at 3,951 units. In this current financial year (April 2021-February 2022), the company has already crossed the 25,000 sales mark (25,777 units) and eyeing to cross its annual target with the consistent rise in demand for its popular electric two-wheelers across all the touchpoints, it added."
Updated: 24 Feb 2022,"As two-wheeler demand recovers, road is tough for margins",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/as-two-wheeler-demand-recovers-road-is-tough-for-margins-11645691154234.html,"The woes of two-wheeler companies are far from over with the industry facing risks from muted rural demand, higher commodity prices, chip shortage, and supply chain disruptions. While two-wheeler companies were hopeful of a sequential margin expansion in Q4 on the back of price hikes in January and expected stabilization in commodity costs, one variable is posing a problem now. Even as prices of steel are stabilizing, those of aluminum and precious metals are rising from November–December lows. Two-wheelers’ higher exposure to aluminum and precious metals is likely to dent margins. True, companies can resort to price hikes, but this would impact demand and affordability. “We estimate 2W (two-wheeler) original equipment manufacturers (OEM) would have to increase prices by 2.0-2.5% to fully pass on the recent impact and maintain gross margins at 3QFY22 levels"" said analysts at IIFL Securities in a report. As such, there is a slight relief as analysts believe that the demand is bottoming out now. Demand is set to rebound with the economy opening up and an expected healthy rabi crop season which will aid rural demand. The upcoming marriage season is also likely to help demand. The increased penetration of two-wheelers in Indian households over the years is proof that it is prime to India’s mobility. “The combined effect of big regulatory cost push, weak economy and Covid has resulted in 2W volume declining 34% over FY19-22E. We believe Indian 2W demand is ripe for recovery after the worst fall in five decades. We expect an urban-led revival to drive faster growth for scooters and premium motorcycles vs sub-125cc bikes"" said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd in a report Further, better growth in urban areas will favor the likes of Bajaj Auto Ltd and Eicher Motors Ltd owing to its meaningful presence in the premium segment. TVS Motor Co. Ltd is gaining an increased share in 2W exports. But concerns continue to persist for Hero MotoCorp Ltd as it primarily operates in the entry segment. Investors seemed to factored this going by the underperformance of Hero MotoCorp’s shares vis-à-vis its peers in the past one year. Besides that, Hero MotoCorp does not have a presence in the 3W segment like TVS and Bajaj and it also has a relatively lesser exposure in exports. Meanwhile, the electric vehicle (EV) segment is seeing an increase in new entrants reflecting that EV adoption is accelerating. Listed OEMs are also focusing on expanding their presence in this segment as the whole industry moves towards sustainable options. TVS Motor, Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp are either planning to launch a new electric vehicle in the coming years or expand their current offerings to more cities. “Share of EVs in 2Ws has risen from just 0.4% in FY21 to 3% (~9% of scooters) in Jan-Feb; we expect EVs to form 8% of 2Ws (25% of scooters) by FY25,"" added the Jefferies report"
