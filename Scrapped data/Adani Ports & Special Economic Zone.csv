Updated: 28 Jun 2022,Adani Ports moves SC against HC order,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/adani-ports-moves-sc-against-hc-order-11656436971399.html,"MUMBAI : Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd on Tuesday moved the Supreme Court against Bombay High Court’s rejection of its plea on disqualification of its bid for maintenance and upgrade of the container terminal in Navi Mumbai by the board of trustees of Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority (BTJNPA), according to people aware of the development. A query sent to a spokesperson for Adani Ports for confirmation was not answered immediately. On Monday, Chief Justice Dipankar Datta of Bombay High Court rejected the company’s plea against BTJNPA and called it unmeritorious. The court had also directed the company to deposit Rs5 lakhs with the tender to JNPA. The firm had already paid a major chunk of the amount and was thus asked to deposit the remaining amount. The Supreme Court’s division bench led by Justice Surya Kant and J.B. Pardiwala asked the company to approach the registry to get their matter listed for hearing. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, the lead counsel representing Adani Ports, requested the division bench to take up the matter on Wednesday as JNPA was inviting bids from Wednesday. He also asked the court to grant status quo by restraining the authority from proceeding with the bids. The Adani group firm argued that its exclusion from the JNPA contract procedure was unlawful and mala fide. The JNPA board had come across an order by Andhra Pradesh High Court that upheld the termination of the concession agreement by Vizag Port Trust (VPT). It asked the company to show cause as to why it should not be disqualified from the bid. The company was also given a hearing by the JNPA board. However, in May JNPA wrote to the company that as VPT had issued a termination letter to them, it was disqualified from participating in the process. Adani Ports said it had provided to JNPA all the documents about the dispute between Adani Vizag Coal Terminal Pvt Ltd and Vishakapatnam Port Authority."
Updated: 27 Jun 2022,HC rejects Adani plea against JNPA,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/hc-rejects-adani-plea-against-jnpa-11656352899872.html,"MUMBAI : The Bombay high court on Monday rejected Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd’s application that challenged the decision by the board of trustees, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority (JNPA), to disqualify its bid for upgrade of a container terminal in Navi Mumbai. This comes after Adani Ports had moved the court earlier in May. “We find no merit in the contentions urged on behalf of Adani Ports. Accordingly, the petition stands dismissed,"" said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice M.S. Karnik. “The decision of JNPA to disqualify the petitioner after having once declared it as qualified, to our mind, conforms to the settled law that JNPA was bound by the tender terms and conditions, which amounts to a representation to the public, and that any deviation therefrom would have amounted to a fraud on public, unless JNPA reserved unto it a power of relaxation of an eligibility criterion,"" the bench ruled. The court stated the case as unmeritorious and directed Adani Ports to pay ₹5 lakh to JNPA. The company has already paid ₹4.24 lakh with tender to JNPA and, thus, is expected to pay the remaining within a month. The tender issued was a global invitation of Request For Qualification (RFQ) calling for applications from interested firms for upgrading, operating, maintenance and transfer of Jawaharlal Nehru Port Container Terminal through a public-private partnership for a concession period of 30 years. On May 3, JNPA eliminated the private firm from the competition to privatise the state-run port authority’s container handling facility. Based on JNPA’s terms and conditions in the tender document, any firm involved in contract termination at other ports will not be permitted to participate in the terminal privatisation bidding process. A segment of APSEZ’s contract to run a coal handling terminal at the Vishakapatnam Port Authority was cancelled in December 2020. Adani Vizag Coal Terminal Pvt Ltd is part of Adani Ports. The Adani group firm, however, said its exclusion from the JNPA contract procedure was unlawful and malafide. The board had come across an order by Andhra Pradesh High Court upholding the termination of the concession agreement by Vizag Port Trust."
Updated: 08 Mar 2022,Indian Oil to build more crude oil tanks at Adani's Mundra port,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/indian-oil-to-build-more-crude-oil-tanks-at-adani-s-mundra-port-11646737046691.html,"Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) on Tuesday signed an agreement with Indian Oil Corp Ltd (IOCL) towards augmentation of IOC’s crude oil volumes at Mundra. Indian Oil will expand its existing crude oil tank farm at APSEZ’s Mundra Port, thus enabling it to handle and blend additional 10 mmtpa crude oil at Mundra. This will support IOCL’s expansion of its Panipat Refinery (Haryana). IOCL is raising the capacity at its Panipat Refinery by 66% to 25 MMPTA to meet India’s rapidly growing energy requirements, Adani Ports said in a statement. ""Mundra Port is a major economic gateway that serves the northern hinterland of India by providing multimodal connectivity. It gives us immense pride to strengthen our partnership further and support IOCL, which plays a vital role in ensuring the energy security of the nation. As IOCL’s trusted long-term partner, APSEZ is well equipped to handle the additional 10 MMTPA crude oil at our existing single buoy mooring (SBM) at Mundra."" said Karan Adani, CEO and Whole Time Director of APSEZ. Indian Oil, which accounts for nearly half of India's petroleum products’ market share, has a refining capacity of 80.55 MMTPA and over 15,000 KM of pipeline network. Part of IOCL’s current crude oil requirement of 15 MMTPA for its Panipat Refinery is handled at the SBM at Mundra Port. The Mundra SBM is located 3-4 km off the coast where Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) unload crude oil. An undersea pipeline then transports this crude oil from SBM to the Crude Oil Tank Farm and thereafter to the refinery at Panipat via the Mundra Panipat Pipeline (MPPL). Indian Oil is currently operating a crude oil tank farm in an exclusive area in Adani’s Mundra Special Economic Zone, consisting of 12 tanks with a total capacity of 720,000 KL. The addition of 9 new tanks will augment the storage capacity to 1,260,000 KL, thus making Mundra Port by far the largest port based crude oil storage facility for IOCL. This will be accompanied by augmentation of the MPPL pipeline capacity by IOCL to 17.5 mmtpa. IOCL Board had approved a capital expenditure of INR 9000 crore for the crude oil tanks and MPPL augmentation in December 2021, Adani Ports said. This expansion project at Mundra Port underlines the trust of state-run IOCL in APSEZ, earned through its strategic approach of modernizing its ports, improving turnaround time, and thus creating value for its customers, the company said."
Updated: 30 Jan 2022,APSEZ receives NCLT approval for Amalgamation of Sarguja Rail Corridor,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/apsez-receives-nclt-approval-for-amalgamation-of-sarguja-rail-corridor-11643529337686.html,"New Delhi: Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd’s (APSEZ) composite scheme of arrangement to acquire Sarguja Rail Corridor Pvt Ltd (SRCPL) has been approved by the Ahmedabad Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and will be effective from the Appointed Date of 1 April 2021. APSEZ will now consolidate all rail assets under a single business entity – Adani Tracks Management Services Pvt Ltd – creating value for all stakeholders from day one, as it aligns with APSEZ’s vision of being a leader in the Transport Utility space, a company statement said. This consolidation will allow APSEZ, which is targeting 2,000 km of track length by 2025, to participate in Indian Railways PPP projects without having to compete with similar businesses in the Adani portfolio, a position that is in full alignment with the equity interests of minority shareholders. Karan Adani, CEO and whole time director of APSEZ said, “As per the national rail plan 2020, Indian Railways will invest more than ₹3 Lakh Crore over the next 10 years to construct new rail lines. Further, the government’s shift in focus from road to rail as the preferred mode of transport, an obvious choice both economically and environmentally, will require significant participation of the private sector. Therefore, this acquisition creates significant business value for APSEZ as a Transport Utility."" ""The process adopted by APSEZ to acquire SRCPL from another entity within the Adani Group,"" added Karan Adani, “reflects our continuous commitment to enhancing our corporate governance practices. The strongest endorsement of the process lies in the overwhelming support it received from our minority shareholders, reaffirming their confidence in APSEZ’s management."" The acquisition being a related party transaction, APSEZ adopted a transparent approach with minority shareholders and creditors for approval. Some of the key steps in the approval process included: Proposal evaluation by an Executive Committee (EC) of three independent board directors; Independent asset valuation (by Deutsche Bank and BDO Valuers) and ‘fairness opinion’ from JP Morgan and JM Financial on the valuation; Post NOC from the stock exchanges, an application was filed for an NCLT- convened meeting of APSEZ’s equity shareholders and secured and unsecured creditors, to vote on the proposal; Over 92% of minority shareholders and close to 100% of debtors voted in favour of the proposal; NCLT, after reviewing the outcome, has approved the composite scheme. The acquisition of Surguja Rail will create value for all stakeholders from day one, as it is EPS accretive. The company said that significant growth opportunity is available as the business is yet to mature, including in non-Adani mine areas with annual potential of up to 40 MMTPA. It added that critical and environment-friendly transport infrastructure will help decarbonize the mineral transport sector. Besides, secured long-term contract with sovereign equivalent counterparty will provide annuity like returns."

Updated: 06 Oct 2021,Adani group raises $9 billion from offshore bond market,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/adani-group-raises-9-billion-from-offshore-bond-market-11633457139162.html,"MUMBAI : Billionaire Gautam Adani’s group has become the biggest issuer of offshore bonds from India with multiple group companies issuing bonds in the past five years to raise more than $9 billion from foreign investors. The Adani group’s flagship company Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) alone has raised over $5 billion during this period across nine bond issuances and is the biggest private sector issuer of foreign bonds from India, according to data from financial markets tracker Refinitv. Only state-owned lenders, such as Power Finance Corp. Ltd and Export Import Bank of India, have raised more than APSEZ, the data showed. The two have raised $7 billion and $6 billion, respectively. Other major overseas bond issuers from the Adani Group include Adani Transmission Ltd and Adani Green Energy Ltd, which raised $2.29 billion and $1.61 billion, respectively. JSW Steel is the second biggest private sector issuer of overseas bonds raising $3.87 billion. APSEZ, JSW Steel and Adani Transmission Ltd are the only non-financial services and non state-owned enterprises to feature in the list of top 10 offshore issuers from India. “The Adani Group has been the most active and repeat issuer in the overseas bond market and the market is now very comfortable investing in an Adani paper. Hence, we have also seen the Adani Group raising capital through very long dated bonds such as 20 years, for which generally offshore investors are comfortable only with state-owned enterprises that have previously raised 30-year money,"" said a investment banker who advises companies on offshore bond offerings. “Offshore capital has been available at cheaper rates given the liquidity in the global markets and low interest rates. Given that it (the Adani Group) has been one of fast-growing conglomerates in the country investing in capital-intensive infra sectors, it has had the need to increase its access to capital beyond domestic banks and markets,"" the investment banker said. In July, APSEZ became the first infra company to raise 20-year money from international bond markets, issuing $750 million bonds of dual tranche 10.5-year and 20-year unsecured bonds in global capital markets. As of August, the firm’s foreign debt comprised 70% of its overall debt with rupee debt accounting for the remaining 30%. The fact that Adani firms such as APSEZ and Adani Transmission have a high rating of BBB-, similar to India’s sovereign rating, has helped the company tap the liquidity in global debt markets. It is not just the Adani group that has been active in the overseas markets. With bond yields at a historical low, fundraising activity in the offshore bond market is on its way to likely surpass the $21 billion record of 2019. “Indian corporate issuers tapped the offshore US dollar bond markets and raised more than $16.6 billion so far this year, the highest first nine-month period by proceeds since records began in 1980. Aside from the financials sector, a wider variety of companies from various industries took advantage of the favourable market conditions driven by the relatively low interest rate environment, greater liquidity in international markets, and strong investor demand for attractive yields,"" said Elaine Tan, senior analyst, Refinitiv, an LSEG Business. “Beyond diversification from India’s domestic bond markets, sustainability-themed targets emerged as a significant key driver. ESG-related bond issuance accounted for 43% of the Indian corporate US dollar-denominated bond proceeds, raising $7.1 billion in proceeds."""

By raising funds “without stretching the balance sheet, we should easily be able to do that acquisition,"" he said. The transaction underscores the rapid expansion spree that the Adani Group has seen in recent years as billionaire-founder Gautam Adani -- Karan Adani’s father -- rapidly diversifies what was once an agri-trading business into a conglomerate spanning ports, power generation, airports, data centers and green energy. Adani Ports, which is India’s largest private port operator, has synergies with Concor as the latter owns inland ports -- called dry ports -- across the country in addition to providing rail transport for containers that are critical for port operations. The publicly traded state-run firm also handles cold-chain and air cargo besides managing some ports. all these will bolster Adani Ports’ portfolio. The Narendra Modi-led government is looking to dilute its stake in Concor from 55% to a minority stake. Concor’s Chairman V. Kalyana Rama called the disinvestment process a “work in progress"" in a July 30 call with analysts. While Adani Ports can also scale up on its own, Karan Adani said it would take a lot of time. “It is possible to create an alternate, but it takes 10 years,"" he said. “You are paying to fast track your strategy."""

The proceeds will be used to repay existing debt, for capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes of the company and its subsidiaries in India and Sri Lanka, the company said. The bond issuance was approved by the company’s board on Wednesday. Axis Bank, Barclays, Bank of America, Citi and others are advising the company on the fundraise. “The investor roadshows have been started and the deal should be closed soon. The company plans to raise at least $500 million through this bond offering,"" said a person aware of the company’s plans. On Wednesday, international rating agency Moody’s assigned a Baa3 rating to the proposed bonds, with a negative outlook. “APSEZ's Baa3 issuer rating primarily reflects the company's strong market position as the largest port developer and operator in India by cargo volume. The rating also takes into consideration the long-term growth potential of India's economy as a whole, a key driver behind the large increase in the volume of traded goods over the past few years. APSEZ reported strong 16.5% growth in container cargo volumes in fiscal 2021 compared with the previous year and increased its market shares in India to 41.2% compared with 35.5% in fiscal 2020, the rating agency noted. “Moody's expects that APSEZ's performance over next two to three years will be driven by the ramp-up of capacity relating to its recently acquired and commissioned ports and terminals and its growing share of containers, with the addition of new terminals to its portfolio. That said, in the short term APSEZ is operating in a challenging global economic environment as a result of the coronavirus outbreak and continued global trade tensions. The cargo growth was a moderate 2.2% in fiscal 2021 after adjusting for the Krishnapatnam acquisition, which contributed 20 million tonnes for a six-month period,"" it said. Moody's expects APSEZ's overall volumes to increase by 20%-25% in fiscal 2022, which will be helped by the recent acquisitions of the Dighi and Gangavaram ports."
Updated: 13 Jul 2021,‘Consumption boost will create a $15 tn economy’,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/indias-consumption-story-will-create-15-trillion-economy-gautam-adani-11626076519729.html,"The covid-19 led disruptions notwithstanding, consumption by India’s middle class will help create a $15-trillion economy in two decades, said Gautam Adani, chairman of Adani group, on Monday. In his address to shareholders at the annual general meeting of Adani Enterprises, Adani also rejected ""reckless, irresponsible reporting"" about the company’s shareholding in June which caused unexpected fluctuations in the market prices of his group's stocks. Adani added that there should be no doubt about India’s target to be a five-trillion-dollar economy in four years. ""History has shown that, out of every pandemic crisis, there emerge several learnings – and I believe that India and the world are wiser as we go through this pandemic,"" he said. ""India will be 5 trillion-dollar economy--and then go on to be a 15 trillion-dollar-plus economy over the next two decades. India will emerge as one of the largest global markets, both in terms of consumption size and market cap,"" Adani told shareholders. Referring to the drop in share prices of the group companies, Adani said the group's focus is on creating long-term sustainable value. “Recently, a few media houses indulged in reckless and irresponsible reporting related to administrative actions of regulators. This caused unexpected fluctuations in the market prices of Adani stocks. Unfortunately, some of our small investors were affected by this twisted narrative in which some commentators and journalists seemed to imply that companies have regulatory powers over their shareholders and that companies can compel disclosure. In the long term, such diversions will not impact us,"" he said. For the fiscal year 2021, the consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of the group’s listed portfolio was over ₹32,000 crore: a year-on-year growth of 22%. “All the Adani stocks generated returns over 100 percent – and our businesses ensured that we returned close to ₹9,500 crore to you, our equity shareholders. This is a 166% increase in profit after tax on a year-on-year basis,"" he said. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) has become an integrated ports and logistics company. In the financial year 2021, APSEZ crossed a landmark after its share of India’s port-based cargo business rose to 25% and the container segment market share grew to 41%. It continued to diversify further, with LNG & LPG business in Mundra added to the portfolio and LNG operations being added in Dhamra. “No other company in the world runs a port business of such scale and reach,"" he said. Adani Green Energy, in 2020, became the largest solar company in the world. Last month, following the acquisition of SB Energy’s five-gigawatt portfolio, at an enterprise valuation of about $3.5 billion, the company pushed up to its renewables target of 25 gigawatts a full four years ahead of schedule, the company said. Through Adani Enterprises, the group made its move into airports. Today, one of every four passengers in India flies through an Adani airport, he said. “No airport business in any large country has achieved a 25% share of the total passenger traffic. The company also took over operations of airports in Ahmedabad, Lucknow and Mangalore, signed concession agreements for Guwahati, Jaipur & Thiruvananthapuram, and is now in the process of acquiring the Mumbai and Navi Mumbai International Airports. ""In addition to developing our pan-India airport network, we are also increasing our focus to include non-passenger revenue and nurturing a range of possibilities within both – the physical and digital infrastructure,"" Adani said, adding that whatever businesses the group is in – seaports, airports, logistics, natural resources, thermal and renewable power generation, transmission, distribution, data centres, defence, agri and food, real estate, city gas utilities, and several others– "" I believe that our real phase of accelerated growth is just beginning. This is because our Group benefits greatly from having a portfolio of companies with several strategic adjacencies that will fuel our future growth in a diverse range of sectors,"" he said."
Updated: 08 Jul 2021,Adani Ports stock’s lower valuations may be a buying opportunity,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/adani-ports-stock-s-lower-valuations-may-be-a-buying-opportunity-11625722783879.html,"Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd shares have declined nearly 20% from their 52-week high seen on 9 June on the National Stock Exchange. During this time, the stock has come under pressure as doubts were raised officially about the foreign shareholding of the Adani Group shares. Last month, The Economic Times had reported that National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) froze accounts of three of the foreign investment firms that held Adani Group stocks. Though Adani Ports had said that the three foreign portfolio investor (FPIs) accounts were not frozen, the stock is yet to recover fully. Analysts reckon that this could be used as a good buying opportunity into the stock. “Group net debt to equity is 1.9 times, versus 3.4 times in 2015 when a material corporate governance issue cropped up. Such instances in the past have been buying opportunities, driven by business strength and the promoter walking the talk,"" said analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 7 July. The broker added, “As core port Ebitda growth remains upward of double digits, backed by volumes, and the dust settles around the recent controversy, we think the stock should re-rate back to the average, at least."" Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization and a key measure of profitability for companies. In its financial year 2021 annual report, Adani Ports said it plans to double its cargo volumes to 500 million tonne by 2025. Note that cargo volume stood at 247 million tonne in FY21. “We reported a RoCE of 12% in 2020-21 and intend to enhance RoCE to 20%+ by 2025,"" said the company. RoCE is short for return on capital employed. The company’s March quarter results were lower than some analysts’ expectations with year-on-year Ebitda growth of 31% to Rs2287 crore. Revenues grew by almost 24% year-on-year to Rs3608 crore. Meanwhile, analysts from Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a report on 1 July, “Management has reduced promoter share pledges significantly from the peak levels of FY20 to currently below 10%. Thus, with negligible loans and advances to Group entities and minimal share pledges, we believe Adani Ports is largely insulated from the Group’s performance."" To be sure, investors should note that despite the recent weakness in the shares, the Adani Ports stock has substantially outperformed the broader Nifty 100 index so far this calendar year."

The clarification to stock exchange came in the wake of reports of Norwegian pension fund KLP divesting stake in the company on grounds of its ties with the Myanmar military breach. ""The Company is in discussion with its US based counsels to ensure that the Company is in compliance with the OFAC [Office of Foreign Assets Control] sanctions programs. In a scenario wherein Myanmar is classified as a sanctioned country under the OFAC or if OFAC opines that we are in violation of the current sanctions, the company has plans to abandon the project and will write-down its investments in the project in full,"" Adani Ports said in a filing on Wednesday. The write down will not materially affect the balance sheet as it is equivalent to about 1.3 per cent of the total assets of the company, Adani Ports mentioned. The company also reiterated that it has zero tolerance policy which ensures that there is no contravention of US and other sanctions. Questions have been raised by international investors over Adani Ports' involvement in the project to build a container terminal in the city of Yangon on land leased from a Myanmar military-owned conglomerate. International community has condemned the military coup in Myanmar on February 1 and subsequent harsh crackdown on mass protests, in which hundreds lost their lives. Nations have imposed sanctions on military figures and military-controlled entities in Myanmar. Adani Ports said it is unable to comment on the divestment made by the KLP Fund ""as the Funds decide the investment plans basis their internal policy"". KLP Fund was holding 1.05 lakh equity shares (0.005 per cent of paid-up capital) as on March 31, 2021, the company informed. ""Adani's operations in Myanmar and its business partnership with that country's armed forces constitutes an unacceptable risk of contributing to the violation of KLP's guidelines for responsible investment,"" KLP had recently said in a statement. KLP said it was divesting because the Yangon container terminal is being built on land owned by the Myanmar military and that there is an ""imminent danger"" the armed forces could use the port to import weapons and equipment, or as a naval base."

Asian stocks were steady Wednesday after reassuring comments on inflation and monetary policy from Federal Reserve officials bolstered investor sentiment. Treasury yields held declines. Stocks fluctuated in narrow ranges, dipping in Japan, China and Australia but inching higher in Hong Kong. US equity contracts made modest gains after the S&P 500 climbed a second day. Overnight, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his view that inflation pressures will be transitory even after a notable increase in recent months. He added that the Fed would be patient in waiting to lift borrowing costs. Punjab National Bank, the controlling shareholder of PNB Housing Finance Co. Ltd, is likely to have vetoed the mortgage lender’s planned ₹4,000 crore fundraising from investors led by Carlyle Group at Tuesday’s voting, and will instead propose an alternative plan to raise capital, according to a Mint report. Norwegian pension fund KLP is divesting from Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd on the grounds the company's links with the Myanmar military breach the fund's responsible investment policy, KLP told Reuters on Tuesday.

Markets have stabilized after being buffeted by a hawkish shift in the Fed’s policy outlook as the recovery from the pandemic stokes price pressures. Officials have since sought to emphasize that the central bank is continuing to support the economy with asset purchases and low interest rates to make progress toward employment and inflation goals. In testimony to the House Select Subcommittee Tuesday, Powell said price increases recently were bigger than expected but will likely wane. He also acknowledged the uncertainty around that view. Earlier Tuesday, New York Fed president John Williams noted that a discussion about raising interest rates is still “way off in the future.""

Adani Ports climbed 7% on Monday, extending gains for a second session. Adani Total Gas, Adani Power and Adani Transmission hit 5% upper circuit. Adani Group flagship firm's scrip Adani Enterprises advanced as much as 6%. Mint reported on Sunday that promoter entity Infinite Trade & Investment Ltd invested over ₹1,100 crore in two Adani Group firms between 10-19 June.

It also bought 19.3 lakh shares of Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone worth ₹126.81 crore on 19 June.

Adani group shares were under pressure since last week with investors' wealth eroded over $13 billion after the Economic Times reported that National share depository froze the accounts of three Mauritius based funds due to insufficient information on the owners. The bulk of holdings of Albula Investment Fund, Cresta Fund and APMS Investment Fund about $6 billion are shares of Adani's firms.

The companies involved had rejected the report earlier this week, calling it ""blatantly erroneous.""

This is on a day when the benchmark Nifty 50 index was up 0.50%. It was not without reason. The company’s March quarter results are lower than some analysts’ expectations. For perspective: Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a report on 4 May, “4QFY21 Ebitda is 17% below expectations, given lower margins but should recover as volumes rise and the April 2021 price hike reflects in FY22E."" Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization; a key measure of profitability for companies. Adani Port’s Ebitda for the March quarter increased by 31% over the same period last year to Rs2,287 crore. The company’s revenues have increased by almost 24% year-on-year to Rs3,608 crore. Further, Adani Ports’ guidance for financial year 2022 (FY22) is disappointing said an analyst requesting anonymity. “The run rate for FY22 guidance is the same as seen in the second half of FY21 (H2FY21). H1FY21 volumes were anyway weak."" In its outlook for FY22, the company said it expects volumes to be in the range of 310-320 million tonnes (mt) (including 10 mt of Gangavaram port from Q4FY22). In FY21, Adani Ports cargo volume stood at 247 mt, representing a year-on-year increase of 11%. In addition to that, analysts from Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a report on 4 May, “Management’s FY22 revenue guidance of 35% growth is 4% lower than our forecast, perhaps as it factors some uncertainty due to the second covid wave."" To be sure, shares of Adani Ports have seen a substantial jump of almost 89% from its pre-covid highs seen in January 2020. According to Edelweiss, “Adani Ports has navigated the pandemic year with strong market share gains and new acquisitions, thereby further fortifying its numero uno position in the ports space."" Jefferies believes three drivers will re-rate the stock from current levels. Those are: Market share rise from 21% to 32% with recent acquisitions by FY25E; return on equity back at 20% with asset sweating; and further drop in promoter pledges."

Consolidated operating Ebitda advanced 39% to ₹2,287 crore. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd could abandon a Myanmar container terminal project and write down the investment if it is found to be violating sanctions imposed by the United States, the company said on Tuesday. ""In a scenario wherein, Myanmar is classified as a sanctioned country under the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), or if OFAC opines that the project violates the current sanctions, APSEZ plans to abandon the project and write down the investments,"" the company said in its fourth-quarter earnings presentation on Tuesday. ""The write-down will not materially impact APSEZ, as it is equivalent to about 1.3% of the total assets,"" Adani Ports said, adding that it is in discussion with US-based counsels Morrison Foerster to ensure compliance with the OFAC sanctions. Adani Ports had in May 2019 announced its intent to set up a container terminal at Yangon, Myanmar, and entered through a lease agreement with the democratically elected government.

OFAC, part of the U.S. Treasury Department, administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on the country's foreign policy. A military coup in Myanmar on Feb. 1 and an ensuing crackdown on mass protests in which hundreds have been killed has drawn international condemnation and sanctions on military figures and military-controlled entities. Adani Ports last year won a bid to build and operate Yangon International Terminal, which it has said is an independent project fully owned and developed by the company. An Australian human rights group in March released a report citing documents purporting to show that an Adani unit will pay up to $30 million in land lease fees for the project to the Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), one of two military-controlled conglomerates sanctioned by the United States. Adani did not comment on the lease payments detailed in the report at the time. ""Adani Ports has a zero-tolerance policy on sanctions and will ensure that there is no contravention of the US and other sanctions,"" it said on Tuesday, adding that it has engaged U.S.-based law firm Morrison Foerster to ensure compliance. It said it has invested $127 million, including a $90 million upfront payment for leasing land, and employs about 300-350 people at the site directly and through sub-contracts.

The Indian government today said that 19 companies have applied for its new production linked incentive (PLI) scheme for IT hardware. The scheme was announced in March and is similar to the one offered for domestic mobile phone production last year. The applicants for the IT hardware scheme include 15 domestic companies and 4 global firms.

Laptops, tablets, all-in-one personal computers (AIOs) and servers are amongst the target segments under this scheme.   European stocks struggled for traction and U.S. futures slipped on Tuesday as technology shares continued to weigh on equities following weakness among sector giants on Wall Street. The dollar rallied. The Stoxx 600 Index erased a gain as online food delivery service HelloFresh and semiconductor firm Infineon Technologies AG dragged the benchmark lower. Travel firms gained after the European Union announced plans to reopen its borders to tourists after months of pandemic-induced restrictions. Shares rose in Hong Kong, Australia and South Korea.   Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia is expected to cut its official selling prices (OSPs) for Asia in June, tracking weakness in Middle East benchmark Dubai and demand uncertainty amid a new wave of regional COVID-19 outbreaks, a Reuters survey showed. Sources at five Asian refiners expected the June OSP for flagship Arab Light crude to decrease by an average of 28 cents a barrel, which would become the producer's first price reduction since December last year. Their forecasts tracked a loss in benchmark Cash Dubai's premiums to Dubai swaps, which weakened notably over the second half of April and ended the month at its lowest since Feb. 24.   The ministry of corporate affairs has offered relaxation in certain compliance requirements for businesses including a longer interval between two board meetings in view of the hardships during the second wave of the pandemic. Companies are normally required to hold a minimum of four board meetings in a year with the interval between them not exceeding 120 days. This has now been relaxed by 60 days so that the interval could go upto 180 days, the ministry said in a notification issued on Monday. The ministry, in a separate notification, also said it has received several requests to waive the additional fee for late filing of statutory forms which fall due between 1 April and end of May in view of the Covid-19 restrictions and disruption.   The covid-19 pandemic has brought India to a juncture where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) might inevitably have to expand its balance sheet to support the economy, veteran banker Uday Kotak said on Monday. Such an expansion is a serious option when the country is trying to save lives and livelihoods, said Kotak, the promoter and chief executive officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank. “I believe we have come to a time when we will have to be much more open to expand the balance sheet of the central bank and I think the RBI has given the signal through the G-SAP programme,"" Kotak said, referring to the central bank’s plan to purchase ₹1 trillion of sovereign debt papers from the secondary market in the first three months of 2021-22.

Brent crude futures fell 7 cents, or 0.1%, to $67.49 a barrel, having risen 1.2% on Monday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures also ticked 6 cents, or 0.1%, lower to $64.43 a barrel, after gaining 1.4% on Monday.   The Indian unit had settled at 73.93 per dollar on Monday.   Shares of Tata Chemicals Ltd fell on Tuesday, reacting to the company's disappointing March quarter earnings. Among key parameters, its operating performance was particularly disappointing. Consolidated Ebitda margin contracted more than than 600 basis points (bps) to 10.7% on the back of a steep fall in gross margin to the tune of 590 bps. One basis point is one hundredeth of a percentage point. Ebitda fell nearly 30% y-o-y to Rs280 crore in the March quarter. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization. Analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd pointed out that operating margins were estimated at 17% and Ebitda at Rs430 crore. ""One-off item, which impacted Ebitda in its North American operations, was due to the Polar Vortex, leading to higher gas price (net) of Rs45 crore during 4QFY21. Adjusting for the same, Ebitda stood at Rs330 crore, down 18% y-o-y.""   Every meaningful decline in the market is getting bought into and despite the key indices struggling, individual themes are not holding them back. Although, we may see flat close for Nifty and slightly weaker for BANKNIFTY, we witnessed a good broad based activity in the market. Hence, it’s advisable to stick to a stock centric approach and it’s okay if we avoid index specific trades for a while. But for compulsive index traders, try to buy as close as possible to intraday supports and avoid carrying overnight aggressive bets. As far as Nifty is concerned, 14550 – 14400 remains to be a sacrosanct support zone; whereas on the higher side, we may see Nifty reclaiming 14800 – 14900 once it surpasses the 14700 mark.  Sectorally, the financial space remains to be the weakest link but fortunately BANKNIFTY managed to hold on to a key support of 32000. It would be interesting to see how it behaves in the coming session. Further, as alluded to in the above section, individual themes are doing exceedingly well, especially stocks from the broader market and hence, it’s better to identify such potential candidates.""   Varun Beverages Ltd (VBL), one of the largest franchisees of PepsiCo outside the US, has begun the financial year on a good note. The company follows a January to December accounting year and the March quarter (Q1CY21) is its first. Consolidated revenues for the quarter saw a robust growth of 34% year-on-year to Rs2241 crore, slightly ahead of Bloomberg consensus estimate of Rs2144.70 crore. VBL’s revenue growth was driven by a 33% increase in volume to 151-million-unit cases. Volume performance was helped by recovery in business operations plus lower base of last year’s quarter owing to lockdown restrictions in the latter part of March. Analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities, in a report on 4 May, said, “VBL’s underlying growth momentum was healthy with two-year organic volume compound annual growth rate of 11.7% in 1QCY21."" While that augurs well, gross profit margin has contracted 294 basis points year-on-year to 55.8%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Gross margins were adversely hit mainly on account of change in product mix and lower gross margins from international operations.   Shares of mid-tier IT company L&T Technology Services Ltd tanked in opening deals on Tuesday. The Street was unimpressed with the company's earnings performance as well as FY22 guidance. On a sequential basis, its constant currency revenue grew 3.8%, missing analysts estimates by 130-150 basis points (bps). One basis point is one hundredeth of a percentage point. However, operating margin improved 140bps quarter-on-quater to 16.6%, aided by increased offshore mix and better utilisation. During the quarter, it won six deals valued at over $10 million, including two contracts over $25 million. In a post earnings conference call, the company's management said going forward, its pipeline remains strong, however deal closures are uncertain. For FY22, the company has guided for dollar revenue growth of 13-15%. The management has attributed the modest guidance to their increased caution due to the recent surge in Covid cases in India.   Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is expanding its presence in the pharma sector and has operationalized 114 pharmacies. It is engaging customers through outreach initiatives, an RIL official said, adding that the company has started a pilot for hyperlocal delivery in Bengaluru. “Pharma is a business which we are in the process of establishing. We’re activating Netmeds, which we acquired in September last year, and a whole round of impactful activation and campaigns which have gone behind it,"" said Dinesh Thapar, group chief financial officer, Reliance Retail, after the company’s fourth-quarter earnings announcement on 30 April. RIL had acquired a 60% stake in online pharmacy Netmeds for ₹620 crore not only to strengthen its e-commerce play but also to beef up its healthcare portfolio using the Jio platform. Netmeds has been integrated with Reliance Retail’s online grocery platform, JioMart.   State-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) raised petrol and diesel prices on Tuesday after the results were declared for assembly elections in West Bengal, Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry on Sunday. This is for the first time since 23 February that fuel prices have been raised in the backdrop of the high-pitched state assembly elections. While petrol price has been increased by 15 paise per litre in Delhi, diesel prices have been hiked by 18 paise per litre. Petrol and diesel were retailing at Rs90.55 per litre and Rs80.91 per litre respectively on Tuesday in Delhi at state-run Indian Oil Corporation Ltd’s outlets.   Shares of SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd are very close to their pre-pandemic highs and the company’s March quarter performance has given credence to this valuation boost. SBI Life reported 63% growth in value of new business (VNB) and an expansion of VNB margin to 22.2%. On both these metrics, the company exceeded analysts’ expectations. Ergo, most have increased their expectations for the next year citing the healthy growth trajectory of the company and its conservative assumptions behind margins. “We raise VNB forecasts for FY22-23 by 9-10% as we factor better premium growth,"" wrote those at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd. (Read here)   The markets are still unsure of the direction. We have a strong support at 14400 which we are not breaking and there is a stiff resistance at 14700 which we are unable to get past convincingly. Until either level is not taken out, we will not see a meaningful move in the markets. If we can get past 14700, the Nifty could scale higher to 15100. If the index breaks 14400, it could drop to 14100.   The support of 14400 was well respected. We took a sharp U-turn from that level to revisit the resistance of 14700. If we can get past this level and stay above it, we still have reasons to target 15100. If we break 14400, we could slip further to 14100.   Shares of Reliance Industries, Adani Ports and SEZ, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Auto could be in focus today. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Total Gas, IIFL Securities, Larsen & Toubro Infotech, Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health Care, RBL Bank, Suven Life Sciences, among others, will release quarterly earnings today.   Blaming the slow pace of vaccinations and uncertainty around the number of those infected and dead in the second COVID-19 wave, global brokerage firm Barclays cut India's FY22 GDP growth estimate to 10% from an earlier projection of 11%. If the ongoing localised lockdowns continue till June, it will lead to economic losses of $38.4 billion, it said. In a more pessimistic scenario of the pandemic not being brought under control soon and mobility restrictions continuing till August, the growth rate can fall to 8.8%, Barclays warned. The country's economy is estimated to have contracted 7.6% in FY21 as the pandemic-induced lockdowns led to hit economic activity, jobs and demand.   In early deals today, SGX Nifty futures were at 14,657.50, down 0.3% from previous close, indicating a weak start for domestic benchmarks.   Asian stocks were mixed and U.S. equity futures retreated in early deals on Tuesday following the overnight dip in technology giants on the Wall Street. The dollar steadied after declining along with Treasury yields. South Korean shares slid while Australia rose modestly. Trading will be limited with Japan and China among markets closed for holidays. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.3%, while South Korea’s Kospi shed 0.4% Hang Seng Index futures added 0.8%.   Wall Street stocks mostly rose on Monday, fulled by optimism over strengthening US growth, but the Nasdaq fell due to weakness in Amazon and other large tech names. An industry survey showed America's manufacturing rebound from the Covid-19 downturn slowed in April as factories struggled to obtain supplies, but even so companies were increasingly optimistic about the future. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.7% to end the day at 34,113.23, while the broad-based S&P 500 rose 0.3% to 4,192.66. The Nasdaq shed 0.5% to finish at 13,895.1.  "

The group’s flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd., gas supplier Adani Total Gas Ltd. and power distributor Adani Transmission Ltd. may get included in MSCI Inc.’s country benchmark after the index provider’s semi-annual review of its gauges in May, according to broker Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd. and independent research provider Smartkarma. Adani Green Energy Ltd. and Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd. are already there. The potential inclusions are seen further boosting wealth for Adani, who has added $20.2 billion to his net worth this year, the second-biggest increase among the world’s billionaires. The tycoon -- who started out as a commodities trader in the late 1980s -- has diversified from mines, ports and power plants into airports, data centers and defense. The rally in stocks shows investors have rewarded his strategy of interlocking his group’s interests with the Indian government’s infrastructure program. Also Read | Restaurants are now down to the waterline There is “very high probability of these Adani names to come in the index primarily due to the surge in their market capitalization,"" Brian Freitas, a New Zealand-based analyst at Smartkarma, said by phone. “ETFs and other passive funds will have to buy, adding to Adani’s fortune."" Passive funds may have to buy shares worth about $830 million in total in the three companies after their inclusion, according to calculations by Freitas. Still, these stocks “trade much much higher than their global peers and longer-term returns may not be worth the risks involved,"" he wrote in a note Wednesday. Meanwhile, S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a statement Monday that it will remove Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone from the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes because of links to Myanmar military. A lack of analyst coverage for many of the Adani group’s companies hasn’t deterred MSCI from adding their stocks as the index provider’s focus is more on other factors such as market value. Adani Green, which was added to the MSCI India gauge end-November, still has no analysts covering it, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. MSCI is set to declare the results of its latest review on May 11 and changes will be effective from close of trading on May 28, according to an announcement by the index provider in February. “We do not comment on market speculation on index changes,"" a spokeswoman for MSCI wrote in an emailed response.

Updated: 06 Apr 2021,"Adani  joins  Reliance, Tata groups  with over $100  billion  market  cap",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/adani-joins-reliance-tata-groups-with-over-100-billion-market-cap-11617733175082.html,"MUMBAI : The Adani group became the third Indian conglomerate to surpass $100 billion in market value as a dizzying rally in the shares of Gautam Adani-run companies propelled the group past many titans of Indian industry. On Tuesday, shares of four of the six publicly traded Adani group companies soared to a record. Adani Enterprises Ltd surged 8% to ₹1,240.45; Adani Total Gas Ltd rose 6% to ₹1,248; Adani Transmission Ltd jumped 5% to ₹1,147; and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd soared 14% to ₹852. The group has established a commanding presence in the country’s infrastructure sector, an area that the central government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has laid special emphasis on to stimulate growth.  Over the past few years, it has made major investments across airports, data centres, natural gas infrastructure, ports and renewable energy. On Tuesday, the total market value of the six listed Adani Group companies stood at more than $107 billion, according to BSE data. Only two other Indian groups—the Tata group and Mukesh Ambani led-Reliance Industries Ltd—have achieved this milestone. The Tata group’s current market value stands at $242 billion, while Reliance Industries’ market capitalization is at $190 billion. Analysts say that the recent surge in stock prices of Adani group was on account of rapid expansion by many group companies that led to earnings visibility in the future. “Adani group stocks have had a strong run over the last year, mainly due to strong traction in renewables and large order wins. However, considering the sharp run-up, the valuations look stretched now. We would thus recommend waiting for a correction before making any fresh investment,"" said Ajit Mishra, vice-president of research, Religare Broking. A total of five companies in the Adani group currently have a market cap of over ₹1 trillion, with only Adani Power Ltd failing to make the cut. Still, the money-losing Adani Power has tripled its market value in the past year to ₹38,000 crore. Adani Total Gas, the group’s city gas distribution venture, saw its market cap jump more than 13-fold in the past year to ₹1.32 trillion. Throughout the pandemic, the Adani group has aggressively expanded its presence across Indian infrastructure through a mix of organic growth and acquisitions. Group flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd ventured into the airports sector in 2019 and now controls seven airports in India and a quarter of the country’s air traffic. It acquired a controlling stake in the Mumbai International Airport, India’s second-busiest, in the middle of the pandemic. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd has acquired three big ports with a combined value of ₹18,000 crore over the past six months, including the Krishnapatnam Port Ltd, Gangavaram Port Ltd and Dighi Port. The group’s gas infrastructure business, Adani Total Gas, an equal joint venture with France’s Total Gas, is developing city gas distribution networks to supply piped natural gas (PNG) to industrial, commercial, domestic (residential) customers and compressed natural gas (CNG) to the transport sector. Adani’s road transport subsidiary has also won eight contracts from the National Highways Authority of India across the country. Despite the head-spinning returns in the past year, five of its group companies—Adani Enterprises Ltd, Adani Green Energy Ltd, Adani Transmission Ltd, Adani Power Ltd and Adani Total Gas Ltd—are not covered by analysts. The sole exception, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd, has 21 ‘buy’, four ‘hold’ and one ‘sell’ ratings, according to Bloomberg. The current valuations of the Adani group’s listed companies are so high that it seems to have priced in all future business growth, which limits further upside, said Vinit Bolinjkar, head of research at Ventura Securities. “Most of the Adani group stocks have very high debt on their balance sheets and promoters have also pledged their shares, which makes the stocks too risky to initiate coverage. That’s why most analysts prefer to stay away from Adani group companies"", Bolinjkar said."
Updated: 15 Mar 2021,Adani Ports-led consortium to develop West Container Terminal in Colombo,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/adani-ports-led-consortium-to-develop-west-container-terminal-in-colombo-11615816689161.html,"Adani Ports and Special Economic Zones Ltd (APSEZ), a key subsidiary of the diversified Adani Group, has received a Letter of Intent (LOI) from Sri Lankan authorities for development and operations of (WCT) in Colombo. APSEZ will partner with John Keells Holdings PLC, Sri Lanka’s largest diversified conglomerate, and with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) as a part of the consortium awarded this mandate. The WCT will be developed on a Build, Operate and Transfer basis for a period of 35 years as a public-private partnership. WCT will have a quay length of 1400 meters and alongside depth of 20 meters, thereby making it a prime transhipment cargo destination to handle Ultra Large Container Carriers. The project is expected to boost WCT’s container handling capacity and further consolidate Sri Lanka’s locational advantage as one of the world’s top strategic nodes along the busiest global transhipment route. The Colombo Port is already the most preferred regional hub for transhipment of Indian containers and mainline ship operators with 45% of Colombo’s transhipment volumes either originating from or destined to an Adani port terminal in India. The network impact of this partnership is significant and expected to be mutually benefitted from the string of 7 container terminals across its 12 ports that Adani operates along the Indian coastline handling an annual volume of over 6 million TEUs. This partnership will multiply and accelerate the transhipment options that will become available to serve various shipping lines and other potential port customers across the South Asian waters, benefiting both, India and Sri Lanka in multiple ways. Karan Adani, CEO and Whole Time Director of APSEZ said, “Any port partnership is a validation of the mutual trust between two nations and in this context the WCT partnership is significant on several fronts. It is a continuation of the deep and mutually beneficial strategic relationship between two neighbouring nations whose history is deeply intertwined, and I am grateful to the Leaders of the Government of India, Leaders of the Government of Sri Lanka and our Sri Lankan partners for the deep trust they have endowed on us. The combination of the strategic location of the Port of Colombo as a launching point for transshipment across the entire subcontinent, the deep domestic strength of SLPA and John Keells Holdings PLC, and the Adani Group’s unmatched network of container terminals across the Indian coastline opens up several dimensions of growth possibilities for years to come, not just within our two countries but also to the east as well as the west of our two nations"". Krishan Balendra, Chairman of JKH, said “We are excited about this opportunity to invest in the much-needed capacity expansion of the Colombo Port and to partner the Adani Group, the leading port operator in India."" He went on to say that the Public Private Partnership development of the West Container Terminal would bring to bear the synergies, expertise and experience of the Adani Group, the John Keells Group and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, which would ensure a world class deep-water offering in the Port of Colombo, catering to the largest container ships afloat."

Currently, GPL operates nine berths and has free hold land of about1,800 acres. With a master plan capacity for 250 mtpa with 31 berths, GPL has sufficient headroom to support future growth. GPL handles a diverse mix of dry and bulk commodities including coal, iron ore, fertilizer, limestone, bauxite, sugar, alumina, and steel. GPL is the gateway port for a hinterland spread over 8 states across eastern, western, southern and central India. In FY20, GPL had a cargo volume of 34.5 million tonnes, generated revenue of ₹1,082 crore, operating revenue of ₹634 crore (margin of 59%) and net profit of ₹516 crore. GPL is debt-free with cash balance of over ₹500 crore. The company has a paid up equity share capital of 51.7 crore shares of which 58.1% is owned by DVS Raju and Family, 10.4% by Government of Andhra Pradesh and 31.5% by Warburg Pincus. APSEZ is acquiring the Warburg Pincus stake of roughly16.3 crore shares (31.5%) at ₹120 a share which works out to a consideration of Rs1,954 crore. The transaction implies EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.9 and price to equity ratio of 12. APSEZ is also in discussions with DVS Raju & Family for their 58.1% stake (roughly 30 crore shares) in GPL. Karan Adani, CEO and Whole Time Director of APSEZ said, “The acquisition of GPL is a part of our continued strategy to build out a port and logistics network that is unmatched in its ability to serve customers across the nation. The location of GPL in the north of Andhra Pradesh is a strategic complement to our recent acquisition of the Port of Krishnapatnam that serves the south of Andhra Pradesh. We believe that GPL holds great potential to complement its bulk cargo terminals with new cargo catagories that we intend to develop. The port provides us great access to an adjacent hinterland that was largely untapped by APSEZ thereby placing us in a position to serve a broader set of port customers as well as expand our overall hinterland logistics footprint for a much larger base of customers."" “From a green field project at the time of investment, Gangavaram Port has developed into a world class port,"" Vishal Mahadevia, Managing Director / Head of Warburg Pincus India, said in the press release. APSEZ is the largest port developer and operator in India with 12 strategically located ports and terminals — Mundra, Dahej, Tuna and Hazira in Gujarat, Dhamra in Odisha, Mormugao in Goa, Visakhapatnam and Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, and Kattupalli and Ennore in Chennai— represent 24% of the country's total port capacity, handling vast amounts of cargo from both coastal areas and the vast hinterland. The company is also developing a transhipment port at Vizhinjam, Kerala."

In December, the group’s container terminal business raised $300 million through an overseas bond issuance. “Adani has been the most active in taking advantage of the lower interest rates in the offshore debt market and now, it’s a group that the offshore market knows well, which makes it easy for them to tap foreign capital regularly. They have also had to look more at this option as a lot of domestic lenders had reached their group limits, restricting access to domestic debt,"" a person advising the group’s bond-raising initiatives said on condition of anonymity. Several Indian companies including State Bank of India and the Export Import Bank of India have raised funds through dollar bonds this month. GMR group-owned Hyderabad International Airport also plans to raise $300 million via overseas bonds to finance capital expenditure.

The latest to join this bandwagon is Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. On Tuesday, the stock was the top gainer among the Nifty 50 stocks, rising nearly 5% and also touching a new 52-week high. Going ahead, investors will have to keep tabs on a couple of factors. Decline in promoter pledges is one. “We believe the management commitment to drop promoter pledges over 12-18 months to 0-5% from the current 45% is a key re-rating trigger,"" said analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 3 November. The second aspect is its debt. “Strong cash flow generation will aid deleveraging,"" said Credit Suisse analysts. For FY21, Adani Ports expects free cash from operations after adjusting for working capital changes, capex and net interest cost to be in the range of about ₹5,500-6,100 crore. As on 30 September, the net debt stood at ₹24,831 crore with the debt-to-Ebitda ratio increasing to 3.44 times. Adani Ports maintains net debt-to-Ebitda is expected to be around 3.5 times in FY21 and will come down within its target range of 3-3.5 times by FY22. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Meanwhile, better-than-expected volumes are helping investor sentiment as well. Jefferies has revised its FY22 earnings per share estimates upwards by 10% to reflect a 5-6% higher FY21-22 estimated volume assumption. Note that Adani Ports’ volumes had risen by 21% year-on-year in October, excluding the volumes from the acquired Krishnapatnam port. Adani Ports had completed the Krishnapatnam acquisition in the first week of October. Further, Dighi port’s acquisition is expected to be completed in the current quarter. To be sure, some are concerned about the volume outlook for the Krishnapatnam and Dighi ports. “Given Krishnapatnam’s dependency on coal cargo and Dighi’s lack of volume track record, these acquisitions would add to risk,"" Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd analysts said in a report on 4 November. Even so, the brokerage house expects volumes to rise about 25% in FY22, on the back of a 10.7% growth in FY21. Adani Ports has said it expects cargo volume to be higher in the second half of fiscal year 2021. During the September quarter, cargo volumes had increased by 7% year-on-year. Overall results were strong last quarter with consolidated revenues and Ebitda both increasing by around 3% year-on-year. The company’s Ebitda stood at ₹1,851 crore for the September quarter."

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. and a local partner received an in-principle approval to sign a deal with Sri Lanka Ports Authority, which will hold majority stake in the project, the people said, asking not to be identified citing rules for speaking with the media. Details of the stake holding are still being worked out after a review of the project following labor protests that had stalled the deal before parliamentary elections in August, they said. India’s foreign ministry and the Adani Group didn’t immediately respond to requests seeking comments. Adani, India’s biggest ports and logistics company, had signed a preliminary agreement for the project last year. Work on reviving the project, being jointly developed by Sri Lanka, India and Japan, comes at a time of rising regional tensions with China. Both India and Japan are members of the informal Quad grouping that along with U.S. and Australia is seen as a counter to Beijing’s influence in the Indo-Pacific region. While the deal was agreed upon last year, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had announced a review after protests by labor unions who feared foreign control over the strategic project, according to reports. The island nation had earlier depended heavily on China for its infrastructure development in the first half of this decade, creating tensions with New Delhi. The neighbors began rebuilding trade and investment ties before the coronavirus pandemic struck. In July, India extended a $400 million currency swap facility to Colombo to assist with post-pandemic economic recovery. The two countries also discussed deferring of debt repayment during Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa’s first high-level virtual meeting since his re-election with India’s Narendra Modi in September. Sri Lanka -- which emerged from a three-decade civil war in 2009 -- was known for taking Chinese loans to fund vast infrastructure projects, including ports and highways, that eventually became part of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative. Its appetite for Chinese cash waned after rising debt forced it to sell the Hambantota port back to China Merchants Port Holdings. Meanwhile, the country’s port authority last week started operations at parts of the East Container Terminal that it has already built, said Chairman Daya Ratnayake. The agreement signed between Sri Lanka’s former government with India and Japan “is still on,"" he said. The Sri Lankan government “is in discussions on how to operationalize it."""

This will result in APSEZ having a 75% controlling stake in KPCL, the Adani group said in a press release. On 3 January, APSEZ had signed a deal to buy the port for an enterprise value of ₹13,752 crore. Mint had reported in June that the company had paused a number of acquisitions across the Adani group, including that of Krishnapatnam port, as it re-evaluated priorities following the coronavirus pandemic, renegotiating acquisition prices lower. KPCL is a multi-cargo facility port situated in the southern part of Andhra Pradesh. In FY21, KPCL is expected to generate an EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of approximately ₹1,200 crore, resulting in an acquisition EV (enterprise value)/ EBITDA multiple of 10. This acquisition will accelerate APSEZ’s progress towards 500 million tonnes cargo handling capacity by 2025 and is another step forward in its stated strategy of cargo parity between west and east coasts of India, the group said. ""I am happy that KPCL the second largest private port in India has now become part of APSEZ portfolio,"" Karan Adani, chief executive officer and whole time director of APSEZ, said. “This transformational acquisition enables us to roll out world class customer service to an increased customer base and provide pan India solution to them. Our experience of turning around acquisitions like Dhamra and Kattupalli ports will enable us in harnessing the potential of KPCL. We will target to enhance throughput at KPCL to 100 million tonnes by FY25 and double its EBIDTA by FY23. ""With a vast waterfront and land availability of over 6,700 acres, KPCL is capable of replicating Mundra and would be future ready to handle 500 million tonnes,"" Adani said. “We will replicate our operations and maintenance philosophy at KPCL, continue to focus on environment, reduce emission levels and have zero tolerance for fatalities and thus improve returns to stakeholders."" APSEZ’s 11 strategically located ports and terminals — Mundra, Dahej, Kandla and Hazira in Gujarat, Dhamra in Odisha, Mormugao in Goa, Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, and Kattupalli and Ennore in Chennai — represent 24% of the country's total port capacity, handling cargos from both coastal areas and the vast hinterland.

While the company’s June quarter results were weak, there have been signs of a recovery, with a 6% growth in volumes in July. In comparison, total cargo volumes at major ports (for all commodities) declined 13% in July. The rise in Adani’s volumes and market share gains has got analysts to revise their volume estimates. “We have revised our FY21E-22 volume estimates higher to account for the same,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note. The company said it expects to complete the acquisition of Krishnapatnam Port Co. in the current quarter (Q2FY21) and Dighi Port by the end of this year.  Behind the acquisitions is Adani Ports’ strategy of gaining foothold in established trade routes and attracting cargo volumes through efficient and value-added services. Analysts expect the firm to replicate the strategy with the latest acquisitions as well. The Dhamra and Kattupalli ports in the east coast are a case in point. Business volumes at Dhamra gained traction after Adani Ports enhanced port-handling capabilities and addressed evacuation issues. Kattupalli port benefited from market share gains from the Chennai port region, points out Nomura Research. “Adani Ports has a track record of gaining market share by establishing ports within an established ecosystem. The same was witnessed with Mundra, which has gained on west coast, Dhamra in the east coast and Kattupalli in the Chennai cluster. We believe that Dighi will aid in gaining market share from JNPT until JNPT is able to establish a deepwater port at Wadhawan,"" analysts at Nomura Research said in a note. JNPT is Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, the largest container port in India. Growing cargo volumes in east coast ports at the industry level are helping Adani Ports’ growth in the region. “Management is optimistic on Dhamra and Kattupalli seeing strong growth within ports. Interestingly, east coast has accounted for 38% of incremental volumes in the last 3 years and ended FY20 at 20% of overall,"" added analysts at Jefferies. The reduction in inter-corporate loans and the management’s focus on cash flows reassured investors. Acquisitions will push up leverage in the current fiscal. But incremental earnings are expected to soften the net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) ratio. While all these add to investor optimism, any unrelated acquisition or large investments outside the current business can halt the momentum."

ReNew Power is a seasoned dollar bond issuer and has raised debt capital through this route several times in the past. In January, ReNew raised $450 million through dollar bonds. Indian companies are slowly returning to the dollar bond market post the disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic. Last week, billionaire Gautam Adani-controlled Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Ltd launched an offshore bond offering, raising as much as $750 million. This was the third and the largest offshore bond deal launched by an Indian company since the pandemic disrupted global markets in March. State-owned REC Ltd and agrochemicals major UPL Ltd raised $500 million each in May and June, respectively. The offshore bond market is not yet as welcoming as it was at the start of the year when close to a dozen Indian companies sold their bonds to offshore investors. In July, SoftBank-backed Indian renewable energy company SB Energy had to pull back its maiden $600 million bond offering, because of tepid investor interest, the Economic Times reported."

""While APSEZ’s outstanding consolidated debt will significantly increase by 18 -20 per cent as a result of the acquisition, the refinancing risk is manageable because of the cash flow visibility from the group’s assets, staggered nature of the debt maturities and diversified funding sources,"" said Abhishek Tyagi, a Moody’s Vice President and Senior Analyst. ""In addition, the slightly weaker metrics post acquisition will be counterbalanced by KPCL's strong positioning and market share on the east coast of India,"" added Tyagi.

Updated: 02 Jan 2020,Acquisition of Krishnapatnam port unlikely to test Adani Ports’ limits,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/acquisition-of-krishnapatnam-port-unlikely-to-test-adani-ports-limits-11577904024290.html,"Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd is close to acquiring the Krishnapatnam port in Andhra Pradesh, reported CNBC TV18. Adani Ports aims to double its cargo throughput by FY25 (from FY19), and acquisitions are a part of the plan to achieve its goal. “In terms of our port footprint, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra are the two places where we do not have any substantial footprint. So, yes, we would look at those opportunities which would fall under that,"" the management had told analysts in November. Click here to view enlarged graphic Against this backdrop, the Krishnapatnam acquisition does not come as a surprise even as Adani Ports’ shares rose 3% on Wednesday. The acquisition, if announced soon, will come close on the heels of its subsidiary acquiring Snowman Logistics Ltd for ₹487 crore. Earlier, Adani Ports had been selected as a preferred company to acquire the debt-laden Dighi port in Maharashtra. Cumulatively, the acquisitions will add significantly to Adani Ports’s current debt of ₹31,262 crore (net debt at ₹22,483 crore). The Krishnapatnam port may be acquired at an enterprise value of ₹12,500 crore, the CNBC report added. As of September 2019, Adani Ports’ net debt-to-earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) stood at three times. The firm’s stated objective is to maintain an investment grade credit rating, which stipulates a net debt-to-Ebitda of less than five times. This leaves room for further leverage. A net debt-to-Ebitda of four times provides an additional leverage of ₹9,000-10,000 crore in the current fiscal year, showed a scenario analysis by Nomura research. Adani Ports has also expressed interest in acquiring a controlling stake in public sector firm, Container Corp. of India Ltd (Concor). The divestment process has been slow. Nonetheless, even if Adani Ports has to acquire a controlling stake in Concor, its net debt to Ebitda is unlikely to cross five times, calculations by Kotak Institutional Equities showed. Further, Adani Ports is tactically elongating the maturity profile of the debt. From 4.08 years at the end of March 2019, the average maturity profile of the long-term debt has increased to 5.92 years at the end of September. This leaves Adani Ports with more cash for investments and it is predictably using it for growth. The new ports will deepen Adani Ports’ competitive advantage helping it gain market share. Even so, Adani Ports will have the unenviable task of sprucing-up or turning around the acquisitions. Dighi port, for instance, has been under construction for a long time and faces connectivity challenges. Similarly, the Snowman Logistics acquisition can dilute the logistics unit’s profit margin in immediate term, warned Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd."

Karan Adani, Chief Executive Officer and Whole Time Director of APSEZ said, ""The acquisition is in line with our strategy and vision to be a leader in providing integrated logistics services in India and moving from port gate to customer gate.

The company is also developing a transhipment port at Vizhinjam, Kerala."
Updated: 17 Dec 2019,APSEZ’s bright view is under question,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/apsez-s-bright-view-is-under-question-11576517676538.html,"Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) made modest cuts to its annual forecast last month despite a notable slowdown in the September quarter. Volume growth slowed from 18% in the June quarter to a mere 1% last quarter. But the company projected revenue growth of 11-13% for FY20 compared with its earlier guidance of 12-14% growth. Evidently, the management hopes that volumes will improve in the second half of the fiscal year. However, traffic trends at major ports do not indicate any major recovery. Total cargo at major ports across the country declined 0.3% in November, shows data compiled by Antique Stock Broking Ltd. Worryingly, the fall in container traffic worsened. Container traffic, measured in twenty-foot equivalent unit, dropped 5% last month, a steeper fall compared with the 1.7% drop in October. Around 41% of APSEZ’s cargo volumes are generated by containers. Also, more than one-third (35%) of India’s container traffic is handled by the company. As power plants come out of their maintenance shutdowns during the monsoon, the sector is expected to step up coal imports, which is another large business segment for APSEZ. But coal volumes have not seen any noticeable recovery yet. Total coal volumes at major ports were down 22% in November. Given APSEZ’s tactical investments and capacity additions, the company is seen to be better placed. Volume growth in first half of FY20 stood at 9% vis-à-vis 5% expansion at the industry level (Indian ports’ total cargo). Still, APSEZ’s pan-India presence is increasingly making it difficult for the company to escape the slowdown in cargo traffic. The deceleration in volume growth in the September quarter is a case in point."

After going slow on investments between 2015 and 2018, Steadview exited Flipkart in 2018 and sold it to Walmart Inc.

An additional primary capital of about $500 million is also likely to take place.

Suzlon defaults on bond payments worth $172 million Troubled wind turbine maker Suzlon Energy Ltd failed to make a payment of principal amount of $172 million for outstanding bonds, due in July, Mint reported citing the company’s filing to stock exchanges.
