Shareholders of Mindtree will get 73 shares of LTI for every 100 held. Parent Larsen and Toubro Ltd will own 68.73% of LTI Mindtree, as the merged entity will be known. The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. The merged entity will be valued at ₹1.35 trillion at Friday’s share prices, surpassing Tech Mahindra’s ₹1.25 trillion market capitalization. Mindtree chief executive and managing director Debashis Chatterjee will lead the combined entity, while LTI’s chief executive Sanjay Jalona resigned, citing personal reasons. He will serve his notice period but will not stay on to oversee the integration. The proposed merger will create an entity with combined sales of $3.5 billion that will be able to bid for bigger orders and offer a wider range of services to clients, given larger customers’ preference for hiring fewer vendors that can offer end-to-end services. The merger makes sense at multiple levels, according to Abhisek Mukherjee, co-founder and director of management consulting firm Auctus Advisors. “Other than their complementary portfolios, it will create a meaningful scale for the combined entity. Scale is becoming a prerequisite to qualify for and win large deals, which is the holy grail for all IT services companies. Better access and conversion of large deals by the combined entity is something to watch out for. This will drive both revenue and margin expansion,"" he said. On the flip side, organizational turbulence is something that challenges such mergers of equals, Mukherjee said. “Both LTI and Mindtree have deep leadership strength, and how potential overlaps are managed will determine how quickly the combined entity stabilizes,"" he said. On Friday, shares of Mindtree fell 3.9% to ₹3,374.65 while those of LTI declined 3.6% to ₹4,593.10 on BSE. The merger comes at a time technology services companies face record employee turnover as rivals try to lure workers with bigger paycheques and promotions, as customers continue to digitize their businesses to meet the challenges of doing business in the post-pandemic era. Larsen and Toubro said LTI and Mindtree’s complementary strengths would result in a stronger portfolio of offerings. “This merger represents our continued commitment to growing the IT services business, in line with our strategic vision. The highly complementary businesses of LTI and Mindtree will make this integration a ‘win-win’ proposition for our customers, investors, shareholders, and employees,"" said A.M. Naik, group chairman of Larsen and Toubro. Larsen and Toubro acquired Mindtree in 2019, marking the first hostile takeover of a company in India’s IT industry. The founders of the Bengaluru-based Mindtree initially resisted the takeover but couldn’t prevent the Mumbai-based company from acquiring a controlling stake. Mindtree’s profit rose 49.1% from a year ago to ₹473.1 crore in the March quarter, while revenue gained 37.4% to ₹2,897.4 crore. Meanwhile, LTI’s profit increased by 16.8% to ₹637.5 crore and revenue jumped 31.6% to ₹4,301.6 crore."

The Bengaluru-based IT services company will be merged with Larsen and Toubro Infotech (LTI), another listed IT services company of the engineering conglomerate, Bloomberg has reported, citing people familiar with the development. Many observers, including Mint, had said at the time L&T bought Mindtree in the summer of 2019 that its merger with LTI could pose risk, the two being culturally diverse companies; as though marrying a horse-power driven organization with a one that works on brain-power, that too in the mode of startups. And so, that the board of L&T avoided rushing into merging all the IT businesses suggests a careful, calibrated approach. The immediate question that comes to mind concerns L&T Technology Services Ltd, the smallest IT firm but with a larger share of the giant’s products and platforms business. Will it be merged with Mindtree and LTI? Ideally, it should be. L&T owns 74.05% of the shareholding of LTI, the largest of the three IT services companies it owns, while it owns 61% of the shares of Mindtree.

Ltd., the country’s biggest oil refiner and a large user of hydrogen, will partner with top renewable energy producer ReNew Power and Larsen & Toubro Ltd. to produce green hydrogen that’s fast gaining momentum in the South Asian nation’s clean push. The three companies have signed a binding term sheet to jointly develop green hydrogen projects, while the state-run refiner and the engineering major will form a separate partnership for making electrolyzers for green hydrogen, according to a joint statement from the three firms. The partnership will focus on green hydrogen projects at Indian Oil’s Mathura and Panipat refineries in northern India. Green hydrogen, produced from water and green electricity and considered the cleanest form of fuel, is a potential path to decarbonize heavy industries, such as steel, cement and oil refineries. India, the world’s third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, plans to take the lead and has won support from its richest billionaires, Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani. India aims to produce 5 million tons of green hydrogen by 2030, when its demand for hydrogen is estimated at 12 million tons. India’s refineries consume about two million tons of hydrogen annually, much of it by the Indian Oil group, which holds a third of the nation’s oil processing capacity. Indian Oil is already working toward producing 70,000 tons a year of green hydrogen by 2030, which will account for 10% of its overall consumption by that time. Refineries typically use hydrogen for the removal of sulfur from fuels like diesel. ReNew Power, backed by investors such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and Larsen & Toubro, announced a joint venture in December to develop and operate green hydrogen projects in India, which could attract more than $60 billion in investment. India plans as much as 15 gigawatts of electrolyzer-making capacity and is considering production-linked incentives to encourage local manufacturing to produce some of the world’s cheapest green hydrogen.

Updated: 02 Mar 2022,Super 15: Stocks benefitting from rising popularity of ESG theme ,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/super-15-stock-benefitting-from-rising-popularity-of-esg-theme-11646195130371.html,"In a post-Covid world, conscious investing has gained lot of traction among investors. In fact, in 2021, at a global platform, India made a commitment to reach net carbon zero by 2070. With the environment, social and governance (ESG) theme fast catching-up, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd have outlined key considerations for investors and picked stocks from five sectors to bet on this theme. They are as follows: 1) Coal Sector: The fundamental question for India's transition is linked to its coal sector. Ensuring a well-planned and just transition away from coal will be a significant challenge, with both risks and opportunities in the power sector and beyond. With around 8% of state revenue from coal activities, diversification of the economy is needed. Coal India Ltd will be central to the transition. The company has already taken steps to diversify into renewable power, with three gigawatts of planned solar capacity to FY24. Natural gas is also set to play a significant role in displacing coal. GAIL India Ltd operates around 220 mmsmd (million metric standard cubic meter per day) of pipeline capacity and is the largest LNG trader in India. 2) Agriculture accounts for around 20% of India's greenhouse gas emissions and is the main source of non-carbon dioxide related emissions. Opportunities exist for investors through chemical free farming and low-cost solutions which improve irrigation and energy efficiency. UPL Ltd will likely play a central role in decarbonisation efforts. Through various projects, it is driving the adoption of digital solutions and increased penetration of bio-solutions. 3) Road Transport: With auto demand set to grow to 2040, an uptake in electric power-trains is an important area of focus for policy-makers. Tata Motors Ltd leads the local market with nearly 7% market share. Bajaj Auto Ltd, TVS Motor Company Ltd & Hero MotoCorp Ltd are actively expanding their electric vehicles portfolios. 4) Power Utilities: State-run distribution companies will underpin India's energy transition. Their financial fragility however currently inhibits their appetite for investment and transformation of the power grid. NTPC Ltd should be a key beneficiary of new renewable capacity given its access to low cost funding. Power Grid Corporation of India, Larsen & Toubro Ltd, Siemens Ltd and KEI International Ltd could all see tailwinds from increased transmission and distribution spend. 5) Heavy Industry: Heavy industry's share of energy consumption has increased to 42%, making it the largest end user of energy. Incumbents are focused on renewable power with Shree Cement Ltd, The Ramco Cements Ltd and Ultratech Cement Ltd all active in this regard."

The decline is largely due to the higher base in the year-ago quarter, which included the sale of commercial property in the realty business, and gains on divestment from discontinued operations of the electrical and automation business, the country’s largest infrastructure company said in a statement. Costlier fuel and raw materials also hurt the company. “During the quarter in question, we also had to deal with worrisome inflation. We also had to adjust to the new supply-chain protocols and the logistics constraints in the pandemic. And while these were challenges that the company was dealing with, there were opportunities as well in the form of rising demand, particularly post-festive season,"" said R. Shankar Raman, chief financial officer.

The company won new orders worth ₹50,359 crore during the quarter, down 31% from the previous year, but still above the highest analyst estimates of ₹45,000 crore. L&T said its order book at the end of the quarter stood at a record ₹3.4 trillion. The company, Raman added, is trying to stagger purchases of commodities to maintain margins as it has around 25% exposure to commodities that is subject to price volatility. The group sees an order pipeline of about ₹4 trillion at the end of the current quarter and is “trying to stay as close to"" to its low-to-mid-teen growth guidance for order inflows for FY22, Raman said. The infrastructure segment, the biggest contributor to the company’s revenues, saw sales rise 15.9% from a year earlier to ₹18,345 crore. Operating margin widened 90 basis points to 7.2%, indicating higher operating leverage. The power segment also reported strong growth for the reported quarter at 19% to ₹1,066 crore, while the segment’s operating margin expanded 220 basis points to 4.2%. The hydrocarbon segment, L&T’s third-biggest contributor to revenues, saw a growth of 11% to ₹ 4,880 crore. “With consumer confidence gradually returning, the aggregate demand conditions point towards a sustained recovery,"" the company said, and added that growth could be marred by higher commodity prices and intermittent supply-side constraints. “The global macroeconomic environment is likely to slow down with vaccine inequality and rapid spread of the Omicron variant.

Over the past five years, LTI’s cloud segment has seen eight-fold growth. The company is hopeful of meeting the $1 billion revenue target from the cloud business.           "

Sharing its growth plan, the management aims to boost its revenues by mining existing clients and investing in new high potential verticals and markets, among other measures. Demand continues to be strong across all verticals, markets and service lines with a new large deal pipeline at USD 2.07 billion, a growth of 9% year-on-year (y-o-y), the management said. The management added that demand is shifting towards medium-sized short cycle deals, which is driven by discretionary spends. Further, the LTI retained its margin guidance at 14-15% and said that the company continues to focus on reinvesting to capture incremental market share rather than the margin uptick. “We see this as an indication of the company’s willingness to absorb pricing pressure, unlike peer commentary on price hikes,"" analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a report. While the demand outlook remains robust, the shortage of talent is still a pain point for the sector and the company. It should be noted that despite massive hiring in the recent quarters, the company’s management cautioned that the supply side is a near-term concern and it expects the situation to ease over the next four-six quarters. This could be one reason why shares of the company fell around 1.6% on the NSE in Friday's opening trade. Meanwhile, in the last year, the LTI stock’s price has almost doubled with 99% returns, comfortably beating the Nifty IT index, which is up nearly 57% in the same span. Analysts say, the sharp uptick in the stock captures most positives and has led to a sharp valuation re-rating. At a one-year forward price-to-earnings, the LTI stock is trading at a multiple of around 45 times. The stock is much more expensive than some largecap technology peers such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd."

The bank index eventually ended with marginal gains of 0.39% at 37273. The BankNifty has now reached the October swing low and from here this high beta index had witnessed a strong upmove. By returning back to the origin point of upmove with oscillators in deep oversold territory we witnessed some bounce back in yesterday’s session. However, the momentum is strongly gripped by the bears and hence we expect this support around 36500 – 36600 to be broken very soon. Hence, any further extension of this bounce should be taken to lighten up the existing long positions. Immediate resistance is seen around 37800 – 38000 levels.   The central government will introduce the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill 2021 in the Winter Session of Parliament.

After Monday’s sell off, our market started the day on a weak note as indicated by the SGX Nifty early in the morning. Things looked extremely bleak in the opening trades but fortunately the bears chose to take some breather after nearing the support zone of 17250 – 17200. In fact, as the day progressed, the overall recovery in the market gained some momentum to reclaim the 17500 mark. Nifty might have gained only half a percent from the previous close; but yesterday’s session was full of action as we first witnessed a correction which was then followed by a decent rebound across the board. Yesterday’s low precisely coincided with the daily ’89-EMA’ support which we had mentioned in our previous commentary as well. Since market was too oversold some respite was evident and this is exactly what we witnessed throughout the day. Despite this, we still remain cautious on the market and construe this as merely a technical rebound. It’s better not to get carried away by these intermediate recoveries because we are still not out of the woods yet. For the coming session, 17550 – 17650 is to be seen as stiff hurdle and ideally it would be a prudent ploy to lighten up longs if Nifty extends yesterday’s bounce back. On the flipside, 17200 has now become a sacrosanct support for the Nifty. Although we expect it to be breached soon, it would be difficult to take a call whether it will happen in next two days as we are approaching the November expiry. Our inclination remains on the bearish side and hence, it’s advisable not to be in a hurry to do any kind of bottom fishing at this juncture. The midcap index too had a sharp recovery but if we take a glance at the daily time frame chart, we can see it giving a precise pull back towards its trend line breakdown point. Such recoveries should be used to lighten up longs.   The Indian rupee depreciated by 12 paise to 74.54 against the US dollar in opening trade on Wednesday, tracking stronger American currency in the overseas market. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened on a weak note at 74.53, then lost further ground and touched 74.54 against the American dollar in initial deals, registering a decline of 12 paise from the last close.

As per market observers, Tarsons Products shares are available at a premium (GMP) of ₹155 in the grey market today. The company's shares are expected to list on stock exchanges BSE and NSE this week on Friday, November 26, 2021.

On the Sensex chart, Bharti Airtel, PowerGrid, NTPC, Sun Pharma and Reliance Industries were major gainers – rising as much as 2.04 per cent. On the other hand, Bajaj FinServ, Tech Mahindra, Maruti, Asian Paints and Infosys were among the major laggards. Analysts said the telecom sector is in focus as the sector majors initiated rate hikes which will enhance profitability.   (Long) Nestle: In recent market declines, while the Nifty has reverted from higher levels, FMCG stocks largely consolidated while a couple of them have provided support. Nestlé is one stock among the pack, which saw delivery based buying interest from its sizeable put base of ₹19,000. With leverage positions in the stock considerably low, fresh accumulation is likely to help the stock move higher. We feel, going ahead, stocks like Nestlé should head towards their September series high. Target: ₹20,600; Stop Loss: ₹18,779 (Short) Cholamandalam Finance: The banking and financial space was the worst performer in the current leg of profit booking in the Nifty. Few stocks among NBFC violated their support last week. We feel Chola Finance may violate its major Put base of ₹600 as closure is already happening in the strike. After making a high above ₹650, the stock has continuously been witnessing profit booking. In the absence of any noticeable delivery based buying, we feel profit booking in the stock should escalate and it is likely to head towards ₹585 levels on downside. Target: ₹585; Stop Loss: ₹645   “We’re awaiting further details on the bill that is going to be presented in the winter session of the Parliament.

One of India’s top fund managers is turning bullish on bonds of riskier companies, as an accelerating economic recovery is giving a particular boost to the financial health of such businesses. “Lower-rated companies that have not only survived but also improved their operational and financial metrics in the downturn make for an attractive investment proposition now,"" said Amit Tripathi, who oversees about $15 billion of debt assets at Nippon India Mutual Fund.

India’s economy showed steady signs of strengthening in October as services, manufacturing and exports kept it on course to post the world’s fastest growth. Demand during India’s so-called festive season has helped keep momentum rolling, as shown by a fourth straight month unchanged at a 5 on the Bloomberg News ‘Animal Spirits’ gauge of indicators, which uses a three-month weighted average to smooth out volatility in single-month readings. The measure reflects strength in services and new orders last month, as well as a rebound in exports.   Japan's Nikkei fell on Wednesday, as growth-oriented stocks took a beating from worries the U.S. Federal Reserve might speed up policy tightening to cope with the rising spectre of inflation. U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday nominated Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for a second four-year term and appointed Lael Brainard as vice chair.   7 stocks to buy or sell today   Indian shares snapped four sessions of losses on Tuesday, as metals and energy stocks marked a sharp recovery.

Oil was steady after the biggest gain in two weeks following an announcement by the U.S. of a coordinated release of strategic reserves with other countries that fell short of expectations. Futures in New York traded above $78 a barrel after rising 2.3% on Tuesday. The U.S. will release 50 million barrels, in concert with China, Japan, India, South Korea and the U.K. in an effort to tame prices. Much of the oil will need to be returned to the stockpile by those who buy it, however, and contributions from international partners were smaller than many expected. Focus now turns to OPEC+ and how the group will respond to the move by some of its biggest customers.   SGX Nifty futures traded at 17,611.50 in early deals, up 62.50 points or 0.36%, indicating a positive start for Indian benchmarks in Wednesday's trade.   Asian stocks were steady Wednesday and Treasury yields held a climb as traders weighed the risk of tighter monetary policy to curb inflation and awaited U.S. data as well as Federal Reserve minutes. Shares fell in Japan and fluctuated in China and Hong Kong. U.S. futures were little changed after energy and financials helped the S&P 500 eke out a gain, while the Nasdaq 100 extended a drop. A slew of reports are due later in the day on U.S. economic activity and inflation pressures. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was around 1.65%. The prospect of the Fed speeding up the withdrawal of monetary stimulus has tempered bond market inflation expectations, though they remain elevated. New Zealand’s currency weakened after the nation raised interest rates to 0.75% to curb price pressures, a smaller move than some had expected. The central bank projected 2% benchmark borrowing costs by the end of 2022.    "

In 1985, he was picked as the chief executive officer (CEO) of Wipro Ltd’s IT business. His previous stint was at a manufacturing firm, Shriram Refrigeration. Wipro’s employees, back then, wondered how he would cope in the high-tech industry. Soota ended up leading the company’s IT business for 15 years. When he announced Happiest Minds Technologies Ltd from the terrace of his house in Bengaluru’s Koramangala in 2011, along with 11 co-founders, sceptical scribes peppered him with tough questions. What is it that this new company brings to the table? After all, the IT services landscape was already crowded, and commoditized. Everyone agreed, it does take a lot of chutzpah to start a venture at 69—most hang up their boots by then—but, did he really have it in him to build another company? Between Wipro and Happiest Minds, Soota had also co-founded Mindtree Ltd. A decade later, many of those questions have been answered and critics silenced. Happiest Minds’ executives were initially eyeing revenues worth $100 million in five years and wanted to go public in 6-7 years. While those timelines got stretched a bit, the company has more or less delivered what it promised in 2011. Disruptive technologies such as cloud and mobility were beginning to shape up and Happiest Minds positioned itself in these niche areas, catching the transition of global corporates to the digital. Large, established IT giants hadn’t yet pivoted to offering services around emerging technologies.                          "

Mindtree, LTI and LTTS have taken targets of becoming Carbon Neutral and Water Neutral by 2030. Similarly, LTFH has taken the target to become Carbon Neutral by 2035.  “We are reaffirming our vision, policies, frameworks, roadmaps and action plans on ESG.

In the September quarter, the company reported a massive beat on revenue at $509 million, up 8.9% on a sequential basis in constant currency terms and ahead of the consensus estimate of 3.5% revenue growth. Growth was broad-based across verticals, geographies and service lines. Reacting to Q2FY22 earnings, shares of the company rose 10% on the NSE in Tuesday’s opening trade. Its deal win momentum and deal pipeline remained in good stead. LTI won one new large deal in Europe with a total contract value of ₹30 million for five years. In a post earnings conference call, the company’s management said the deal pipeline is robust with a number of large deals. The management further added that LTI’s growth is constrained only by supply and without which the company would have grown at much higher rate against the backdrop of extremely strong, secular and sustainable demand environment.

With strong net addition in the last few quarters, LTI’s total headcount is up 31% year-on-year. Further, LTI has increased fresher hiring target to 5,500 and target hiring 4,000 resources with one-two years’ experience in FY22. It should be noted that its attrition has increased to 19.6%, up 440bps quarter-on-quarter. “LTI’s deep domain capabilities, strong partnerships with hyperscalers, and robust sales engine will continue to drive industry-leading growth rates. We expect around 23% revenue CAGR, in USD terms, over FY21-23E, which is at the top end of our tier-II IT coverage universe,"" analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a report. CAGR is short for compounded annual growth rate. However, the domestic brokerage house warns of the stock’s expensive valuations. “While we remain confident of the company’s execution capabilities, we remain on the sidelines on the back of a significant valuation re-rating,"" added the Motilal report.
