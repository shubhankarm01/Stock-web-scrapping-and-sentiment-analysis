On Thursday, the BSE Sensex closed at 52,653.07, up 209.36 points or 0.40%. The Nifty ended at 15,778.45, up 69.05 points or 0.44%. US equity futures slid and Asian stocks dipped Friday as traders weighed signs of a slowdown ahead for megacap technology companies and risks from China’s regulatory crackdown. Treasuries and the dollar rose. Stocks fell in Hong Kong and China as well as Japan. Asia-Pacific stocks had jumped Thursday after Beijing tried to allay fears over regulatory curbs on private industries, but US-listed Chinese equities later resumed declines. S&P 500 futures also fell. The gauge rose overnight on data signaling scope for the Federal Reserve to keep policy ultra-loose. US economic growth was solid while trailing estimates. Jobless claims dropped but were higher than forecast. Among key companies, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Indian Oil Corporation, Britannia Industries, Marico, UPL, Bandhan Bank, PI Industries, JSW Energy, and Shriram Transport Finance Co.y Ltd will release their June quarter earnings today. The Maharashtra Food and Drug Authority (FDA) on Thursday said it has issued notices to e-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart after it allegedly found that pregnancy termination kits and pills are available for sale on these platforms without prescription. IFC, and two investment funds managed by IFC Asset Management Company—IFC Financial Institutions Growth Fund and IFC Emerging Asia Fund—have bought a 4.99% stake in Federal Bank Ltd for ₹916 crore, the lender said on Thursday. The dollar snapped a four-day retreat but is on course for its biggest weekly drop since May. Oil mostly held recent gains on expectations that demand from economic reopening will weather delta-strain Covid-19 flareups. Stocks are rounding out a volatile week amid Beijing’s clampdown on private enterprise, which sparked a sharp selloff in Hong Kong and China and briefly caused widespread risk aversion.

Updated: 22 Jun 2021,Sun Pharma’s Revlimid drug patent settlement does not enthuse Street,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/sun-pharma-s-revlimid-drug-patent-settlement-does-not-enthuse-street-11624378702163.html,"Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s agreement with Celgene Corp. is not enthusing investors. In fact, the Sun Pharma stock has not been able to clock much outperformance. It is just about keeping pace with the Nifty Pharma index. Returns have been around 35%, a tad lower than Nifty Pharma’s 38% gain over the past year. For now, there seem to be limited catalysts to spark an outperformance. Sun Pharma has been pushing its US business hard. Its US generics revenue grew 7% year-on-year. But even while the numbers are up, competition is catching up. Its recent agreement with Celgene Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol Myers Squibb, to resolve patent litigation over the generic Revlimid in the US highlights the same. The oncology drug is one of several big products with an annual market size of around $8 billion, and it signals a huge opportunity for Indian pharma. But Celgene is granting Sun Pharma a licence to sell a limited quantity of the generic in the US, which is set to begin after March 2022. This licence further extends the potential to an unlimited quantity after 2026. Still, many Indian generic players are knocking on the doors of this market and have struck a deal with Celgene. This not only crowds the space, but could also see a potential price-erosion in the product point analysts. As a result, the upside for the likes of Sun Pharma stock may be limited. “Six out of 11 para IV filers have settled the patent litigation case now with the majority entering the market in FY23. We estimate this opportunity represents an upside of ₹10/share for Sun Pharma on net present value basis,"" said an analyst with Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. Sun Pharma also recently inked a pact to launch the covid drug Molnupiravir in India. But analysts point out that the current contribution of the covid portfolio is minimal. In the coming quarters, much will depend on the ramp-up in its specialty segment. Analysts are pencilling specialty products to clock revenues of about $600 million in FY22, which is a decent jump compared to $473 million in FY21. But costs are also expected to rise in the second half as marketing and branding costs start to normalize. Hence, despite the uptick in revenues expected, overall margins are likely to shrink a tad this year. One positive has been the pick-up in domestic chronic segment. In fact, the domestic segment grew 13% y-o-y. However, the acute segment is facing challenges due to lower incidence of infection and low patient inflows, note analysts. That may not help its stock much as valuations are rich. “We believe current valuations amply capture all upside related to specialty,"" said analysts at Emkay Global."
Updated: 10 May 2021,"Cipla, Lupin, Sun Pharma ink pacts to make Lilly’s covid drug",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/lilly-issues-voluntary-licences-to-firms-to-speed-up-availability-of-baricitinib-11620642570712.html,"NEW DELHI : US drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co. on Monday said it has issued royalty-free, non-exclusive voluntary licences to Cipla, Lupin and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd to produce its baricitinib drug in India to help combat the deadly second wave of the pandemic in the country. The company is also in talks with other pharmaceutical firms in India to grant similar voluntary licences in an effort to expand the availability of the drug. Eli Lilly recently received permission from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) for restricted emergency use of baricitinib to be used in combination with remdesivir for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed covid-19 in hospitalized adults requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). These voluntary licensing pacts will ensure high-quality manufacturing and accessibility of baricitinib during the pandemic, improving the local treatment options available to those battling by the deadly infection, the company said in a statement. “Lilly is committed to supporting India in this healthcare challenge through our innovative and effective portfolio of breakthrough medicines. During the current surging covid-19 pandemic, we have responded by issuing three voluntary licences for baricitinib by pharmaceutical companies in India to accelerate its local manufacturing and distribution under best quality conditions,"" said Luca Visini, managing director, India subcontinent, Lilly India. “More licences to additional Indian generic manufacturers are expected to be announced soon. This is in addition to the donations being offered by Lilly to the Indian government that will potentially help alleviate the burden of covid-19. We will continue to explore other possible initiatives to support patients and the healthcare system in India,"" said Visini. Lilly is working with the Indian government to fight the pandemic through various initiatives including donations and expanding the availability of Lilly therapies. On 4 May, Lilly announced that an initial donation of 400,000 baricitinib tablets was being made immediately available through the humanitarian aid organization, Direct Relief, to the Indian government for eligible hospitalized covid-19 patients in India, while urgently working to increase product supply over the coming days. This donation furthers both Lilly and Direct Relief’s charitable goal of providing access to covid-19 treatments to patients in need, the company said. Meanwhile, Lilly continues to engage in discussions with the regulatory authorities and government in India to donate Lilly’s anti-covid-19 treatments, including its neutralizing antibodies, bamlanivimab and bamlanivimab and etesevimab which need to be administered in a single combination."

Molnupiravir is an investigational oral antiviral drug, currently being studied in a phase 3 trial for the treatment of non-hospitalized patients with confirmed covid-19. The agreements are aimed at accelerating availability of molnupiravir in India and in other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) following approvals or emergency authorization by local regulatory agencies. “We are in talks with the Government and other key stakeholders as we remain committed to expanding equitable access to medicines and bringing innovative treatments to the country,"" Rehan A Khan, managing director of MSD-India Region, said in the statement. Hetero Group chairman B. Partha Saradhi Reddy said that the company will soon approach the Drugs Controller General of India for a regulatory authorisation. “We are vertically integrated to manufacture and commercially ready to supply this product to patients swiftly across the country. We will be immediately approaching the DCGI to seek regulatory pathway and emergency use authorization,"" Reddy said. MSD is developing molnupiravir in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. “The scale of human suffering in India at this moment is devastating, and it is clear that more must be done to help alleviate it. These agreements, toward which we have been working as we have been studying molnupiravir, will help to accelerate access to molnupiravir in India and around the world,"" said Kenneth C. Frazier, chairman and chief executive officer of Merck & Co, said. MSD is known as Merck & Co in US and Canada. Under the agreements, Merck & Co., Inc., US will provide licenses to these manufacturers to supply molnupiravir to India and more than 100 LMICs. Merck & Co is also in discussions with the United Nations-led Medicines Patent Pool to explore the potential for additional licenses."
Updated: 08 Apr 2021,Pharma firms to track drug supply,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/drugmakers-come-together-to-modernize-india-s-pharma-infrastructure-11617880267157.html,"In an unprecedented move, at least half-a-dozen Indian drugmakers, including Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Cipla, Lupin and Zydus Cadila, have partnered with ABCD Technologies LLP to digitize the country’s vast medicine distribution infrastructure for better tracking of product movement. The platform will allow drug stores to gauge availability of prescription drugs, which in turn will help companies reduce wastage and address any shortages. “If you see (covid-19 drugs) favipiravir or remdesivir, so many people don’t even know where to get them. The entire supply chain between distributors, stockists and chemists is very scattered... The tracking mechanism will allow a chemists to tell patients where they can find the medicine if it is out of stock. It will also allow a distributors to recognize batches that may be about to expire and send it to chemists so that the medicine is consumed and there is no wastage,"" said Girish Vanvari, founder , Transaction Square, which managed the ABCD Technologies deal.  On Monday, ABCD Technologies LLP completed the acquisition of a 91.8% stake in Pharmarack through the purchase of shares from its shareholders for ₹111 crore. The partnership is in the process of acquiring the remaining stakes over the next five years. The entity will also pick up a 33% stake in pharmaceutical market research firm AIOCD Pharmasofttech AWACS Pvt. Ltd for ₹75 crore. Over the next few months it will acquire the remaining stakes. ABCD Technologies will be renamed IndoHealth Services LLP. “The business model of Pharmatrack is to connect distributors and chemists. Right now, they are good in Maharashtra. That will now go nationwide with the strength of the partnership. Similarly, AWACS is one of the most favoured subscriptions (for pharmaceutical market research) and that will also be grown,"" Vanvari said. The track-and-trace mechanism is similar to the Indian drug regulator’s proposed mechanism to monitor the supply chain for key drugs using a bar code system. Vanvari said the entity is also looking to rope in other pharma companies in the initiative and is in talks with some large Indian drugmakers other than the ones mentioned above. “There is a lot of interest from other pharmaceutical companies and they are keen to be a part of this initiative,"" Vanvari said but declined to name the drugmakers as they are listed on the stock exchanges. The initiative is in support of the National Digital Health Mission of the government, which had envisaged supply chain management as a key component, said the six drug companies in their respective statements."
Updated: 29 Mar 2021,China to make covid vaccines in UAE,https://www.livemint.com/news/world/china-picks-uae-as-regional-production-hub-for-sinopharm-shot-11616933879059.html,"The United Arab Emirates will start producing China’s Sinopharm vaccine next month in a deal that deepens Beijing’s influence in the Arab Gulf, long a bastion of US power. Gulf Pharmaceutical Industries PSC said on Sunday it signed a contract to start manufacturing the vaccine from April. With the accord, the UAE will become the first Gulf state to set up a coronavirus vaccine production facility, boosting its efforts to become a supply hub to the Middle East and beyond. The company, also known as Julphar, said it signed the agreement with Abu Dhabi’s G42 Medications Trading. G42, which describes itself as an artificial intelligence and cloud computing firm, had helped roll out trials of the Sinopharm vaccine in the country. The state-backed Sinopharm vaccine was approved in the UAE last year after local late-stage trials showed it was 86% effective in preventing infections -- the country has since overseen one of the world’s fastest inoculation drives, with most people having received the Chinese vaccine. The Sinopharm vaccine can be transported and stored at normal refrigerated temperatures, making it a candidate for vaccination programs in the developing world. The company’s annual production capacity for Covid vaccines is set to reach 3 billion doses, its chairman Yu Qingming said this month, without giving a time frame. While the UAE has approved vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc as well as Russia’s Sputnik V, its inoculation program hinged on Sinopharm given early availability and the potential to produce the shots locally -- key to the UAE’s aspirations of becoming a supply hub. In November, Abu Dhabi launched the Hope Consortium, a logistics grouping with the capacity to distribute more than six billion vaccine doses. The consortium includes the emirate’s Department of Health, Etihad Cargo, Abu Dhabi Ports Group, Rafed and SkyCell. In neighboring Dubai, companies including Emirates airline, ports operator DP World and Dubai Airports have also formed an alliance to move two billion doses of vaccines around the world this year, focusing on emerging markets.

Updated: 11 Feb 2021,"Sun Pharma settles whistle-blower complaints, to pay ₹ 2.36 crore",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/sun-pharma-settles-whistle-blower-complaints-to-pay-2-36-crore-11613047252901.html,"India’s biggest drug maker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. settled years long whistle-blower cases, seeking to draw a line over allegations that set off a wide-ranging corporate governance crisis. The Securities and Exchange Board of India said in a series of statements on Thursday that Sun’s senior management, led by billionaire founder Dilip Shanghvi, will pay a total ₹2.36 crore ($323,886) “without admitting or denying the findings of fact and conclusions of law."" Shanghvi himself will pay ₹62 lakh. The settlement brings to a close a case brought to the regulator by two complaints against the Mumbai-based firm. They alleged fund diversion by Sun and one of its units through Aditya Medisales Ltd. and claimed Shanghvi was getting extra financial benefits from the company’s operations through related-party transactions. The allegations triggered multiple stock slides, forensic audits and forced Sun to tweak some of its business contracts to contain the fallout. Shanghvi has denied any wrongdoing and a spokesperson for Sun couldn’t comment immediately. The company’s shares climbed 2.6% at the close in Mumbai before the statements were released."
Updated: 04 Nov 2020,Sun Pharma shares get a boost as its specialty biz delivers the goods,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/sun-pharma-s-stock-gets-a-boost-as-specialty-products-deliver-the-goods-11604410377911.html,"Pharma companies have had momentum on their side since the first quarter, and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s Q2 numbers show the good run is continuing. The company’s revenues have come ahead of expectations but its margin improvement stood out despite some cost overheads rising in Q2. The stock’s jump of 3.5% post the results announcement on Tuesday was largely due to the improvement in margin, driven by the specialty products business. The pickup in the domestic business is also notable considering that the company has a strong chronic therapies portfolio. Note that chronic therapies have been slow-moving in the domestic market. Domestic revenue growth of about 6% sequentially is notable in that backdrop, and has gone down well with the Street. Sun Pharma also launched about 22 new products in the domestic market, which is likely to reflect in improved revenue growth in coming quarters. The rest-of-the-world market has shown high growth as well. Dollar revenues from this segment grew 31% sequentially. Emerging markets’ sequential revenue growth of 21% is quite encouraging as well. Active pharma ingredient (API) sales also grew well, given that some stocking was already evident in the last quarter. As a result, overall revenue grew about 5.3%, much ahead of the Street estimates. Sun Pharma’s speciality products business has seen an improvement in the US with revenues rising 19% sequentially in US dollars. “Sun Pharma’s specialty business and products like Ilumya and Cequa have reached pre-covid levels. As these products have high margins, the margin improvement story looks set to continue,"" said Bharat Celly, analyst, Equirus Securities. Despite cost increases during the quarter, particularly on operations and research and development, Sun Pharma beat the Street’s estimates quite well. Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margins came at 25.6% in Q2, about 130 basis points higher sequentially, and well over last year’s levels. Of course, some of the operational expenses are likely to rebound further with the easing of lockdowns. Sun is also likely to increase its field force as well. Nevertheless, revenue growth in the US should remain good on the back of its speciality product pipeline. The price erosion seen in the generic space over the past few years in the US market is slowing. The company is increasing filings in the US market. The firm has about 20 tentative approvals, while it received four approvals for drug launches last quarter. While the stock is up about 7% over its pre-covid highs, valuations look fair at 21 times FY22 consensus earnings. Even so, an earnings upgrade cannot be ruled out on the back of improving margin profile."

In the year-ago quarter, India’s largest drugmaker had posted a profit of ₹1,387.5 crore. “Taro reported settlements and loss contingencies of $478.9 million (about ₹3,178 crore), which reflect the one-time settlement charge of $418.9 million related to the global resolution of the Department of Justice investigations into the US generic pharmaceutical industry,"" the company said on Friday. The subsidiary made an additional provision of $60 million, or about ₹455.2 crore, for the ongoing multi-jurisdiction civil antitrust matter. While the losses were primarily due to an overall one-time charge of ₹3,633 crore, Sun Pharma also had a poor quarter as the covid-led global lockdown across markets led to tepid sales, especially in the US market. The Dilip Shanghvi-led pharmaceutical company clocked ₹7,467 crore in consolidated sales from operations, down 9.6% year-on-year. “The Q1 performance reflects the impact of the global covid-19 pandemic and consequent lockdown across markets and is not an indicator of the underlying strength of our business. Despite challenging conditions, we have done well and have not lost market share for any of our key specialty products in the US. We have also maintained our market share in the Indian domestic market,"" said Shanghvi, who is the managing director of the company. Formulation sales in the US were down by a third to $282 million. Sun Pharma’s sales in emerging markets, as well as the rest of the world, were also lower on account of the pandemic. However, the Indian market, accounting for 32% of sales, grew 3% to ₹2,388 crore. Globally, lockdowns related to the covid-19 pandemic have caused significant disruptions across industries, including the healthcare and pharma sectors. As many elective surgeries were postponed and hospital out-patient departments and clinics were shut, doctors’ prescriptions witnessed a drop. This reflected in the financial performance of many pharmaceutical companies, including Sun Pharma."

That seems to be the reason that Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s stock was up about 5% on Friday. Otherwise, there are no major positive surprises or triggers in the Q1 numbers, with the June quarter results largely in line with what the Street was expecting. Sun Pharmaceutical’s revenues fell 9.6% year-on-year in the first quarter. Global growth across many of its markets was sharply lower. A drop of 33.5% y-o-y in the US revenue is sharp, considering that it did well in Q4. The covid-19 impact on this segment is evident going by the slower sales on the specialty portfolio and Taro. To an extent, the slower growth rate was also because of a higher base last year from one-time opportunities. Some of the slowdown is also being attributed to the marginal price erosion in the US. Sun Pharma’s arm Taro points to the sluggish environment in the US with sales showing a yearly drop of 27%.  Revenue growth from emerging markets and the rest of the world segments fell sizeably over last year, which is a disappointment. One saving grace is a marginal increase in the India business. Revenues improved 3% y-o-y. Sales had slumped in April and May in the domestic pharma market. However, Sun Pharma’s domestic arm was able to launch new products, which aided growth. The company’s active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) segment is proving resilience, with growth of about 20% y-o-y. Even so, the contribution of the API business for captive consumption is rising. The company increased research and development expenses to 5.6% of revenue in Q1, from 5.1% in the year-ago period. Some of that will benefit the US drug launch pipeline. Sun Pharma has about 95 abbreviated new drug applications awaiting approval. In Q1, the company received approvals for eight drugs in the US. Meanwhile, Sun’s Ebitda margins improved marginally. “Sun Pharma’s operating margin improvement was in line with what others have reported and is likely because of a favourable foreign exchange rate and lower marketing spend in branded markets,"" said Kunal Dhamesha, pharma analyst, Systematix Securities Ltd. Even so, the stock’s recent run-up of about 23% since the beginning of the year has been sharp. An increase in earnings in FY22 is expected, but may not be enough to justify valuations. The stock trades at a PE of 23 times FY22 expected earnings."

Trends in the SGX Nifty suggest a weak opening of Indian benchmark indices. On Thursday, the BSE Sensex ended at 37,736.07, down 335.06 points or 0.88% while the Nifty ended at 11,102.15, down 100.70 points or 0.90%. Asian equities traded mixed on Friday. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was down 0.2% in early trade, while the broader Topix index slipped 0.4%. South Korea’s Kospi index fell 0.3%, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 1.6%. Hong Kong shares were slightly higher. Wall Street, oil prices, and the dollar slid on Thursday as government data underscored the deep economic impact of the coronavirus and US President Donald Trump raised the possibility of delaying the November election. The US economy shrank at a 32.9% annual rate in April-June, its worst quarter in history by far, while another 1.4 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week. Back home, shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) will be in focus today as the conglomerate has reported a consolidated net profit of ₹13,248 crore for April-June, aided by exceptional income of ₹4,966 crore. Net profit rose 31% year-on-year. Revenue from operations for the quarter came in at ₹88,253 crore. Bharti Airtel Ltd chief executive officer Gopal Vittal on Thursday hinted at another tariff hike, stressing that the telecom company’s average revenue per user (Arpu) needs to move to ₹200, and eventually to ₹300 per month, for a sustainable business model. Vittal, however, did not specify the timeline for hike in calls and data tariffs. India on Thursday imposed restrictions on imports of colour television sets, intending to encourage local manufacturing and check imports from China. Colour television sets worth $781 million were imported in the year ended 31 March, most of which came from Vietnam ($428 million) and China ($292 million). Among major companies, State Bank of India, Tata Motors, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Indian Oil Company, UCO Bank, JSW Energy and Ujjivan Small Finance Bank will declare June quarter results on Friday. The dollar index fell 0.591%, and remains on course for its worst monthly performance in a decade, with the euro was up 0.2% to $1.187. The dollar has fallen on expectations the Fed will maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy for years, which risks adding inflationary pressure. In commodity markets, oil markets fell following Trump's tweet. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled down $1.35, or 3.3%, at $39.92 a barrel after falling 5% earlier in the session.

Sun Pharmaceutical’s subsidiary Taro Pharmaceuticals and its chief commercial officer Michael Perfetto are also among the defendants in the case led by Maryland attorney general Brian E. Frosh. Frosh was joined by attorney generals of all the states of the US. The multi-state lawsuit filed in the District Court of Connecticut alleges that the 26 firms had “a broad conspiracy to artificially inflate and manipulate prices, reduce competition, and unreasonably restrain trade for generic drugs"" across the US. The new complaint, the third against the firms, focuses on 80 topical generic drugs that account for billions of dollars of sales, including betamethasone creams and lotion, nystatin ointment, clobetasol propionate gel, among others. Between 2007 and 2014, three generic drug manufacturers, Taro, Perrigo, and Fougera which is now owned by Sandoz, sold nearly two-thirds of all generic topical products dispensed in the country . The multistate investigation has uncovered comprehensive, direct evidence of unlawful agreements to minimize competition and raise prices on dozens of the dermatological drugs. The complaint alleges longstanding agreements among manufacturers to ensure a “fair share"" of the market for each competitor, and to prevent “price erosion"" due to competition. “This complaint shows again a tangled web of industry executives and sales people who met with each other on social outings and at trade shows, and had conversations that laid the groundwork for the illegal agreements,"" Frosh said in a statement. The other two complaints were both made in the District Court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The first was filed in 2016 against 18 corporate defendants, two individual defendants and involving 15 generic drugs. This case involved Sun Pharma and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories among its defendants. The second complaint was filed in 2019 against 20 generic drug manufacturers.

AQCH is the first phytopharmaceutical approved for clinical trials by the DCGI. The clinical trial will be conducted on 210 subjects across 12 centres in India for a duration of 10 days, the results of which are expected in October. AQCH’s human safety study was completed and the drug was found to be safe at the recommended dose for a phase 2 study, Sun Phrama said. “AQCH has shown anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in in-vitro studies conducted in collaboration with International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), Italy,"" said Dilip Shanghvi, managing director, Sun Pharma. “These results, combined with information on mechanism of action through in-vitro and small animal studies, give us the confidence to evaluate this potential treatment option for covid-19.""

Updated: 31 Mar 2020,"Sun Pharma’s ex-India biz at record low valuations, amid FDA troubles",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/sun-pharma-s-ex-india-biz-at-record-low-valuations-amid-fda-troubles-11585603598142.html,"Pharmaceutical stocks have been receiving high investor attention due to the coronavirus outbreak. However, for Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, the attention is for the wrong reasons. The US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has rapped the drug maker with an official action status indicated (OAI) letter for its Halol plant. This comes as a negative surprise, since the company had received a product approval from the plant just two months ago. However, the company’s ex-India business is already valued at distress levels of about one-time sales, and as such, the impact on valuations is limited, point out analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd. The company’s shares fell by 1.6% on Monday, far lower than the 4.4% drop in the broad markets. It looks like the markets were already worried about headwinds such as adverse observations from US FDA ahead of the development. “1x EV/Sales (for the ex-India business) are distressed valuations. Sandoz sold its portfolio (declining sales) at 1x to Aurobindo after it remained unsold for over 12 months. Thus, the price already factors no recovery in any business,""wrote Jefferies India’s analysts in a note. EV stands for enterprise value.  The OAI letter, in itself, does not impact the firm’s current operations much, although future growth rates could slow as new launches take a back seat, apart from the impact of remediation costs. Jefferies India estimates these costs at $25 million. US FDA had issued several observations in December, to which the company’s response was less than satisfactory. A resolution process not only takes about 12-18 months, but it also requires firms to incur heavy costs as several processes have to be changed. If further responses fail to satisfy US FDA, drug firms then face a high probability of a warning letter. Sun Pharmaceutical has, however, shifted its US business strategy towards launching more speciality products in the US rather than pursuing the highly competitive generics products. This is bearing fruit to some extent as price erosion is less severe in speciality products. The firm now has six speciality products in the US, which now account for about 10% of its total sales. Sun Pharma’s domestic business is proving to be the saving grace amid the tough business conditions in the US. Domestic growth rates are much better on average than that of competition. Sun Pharma’s presence in many different therapies in the domestic market insulates the company from a slowdown in some segments. The average growth rate for the quarter ended February 2020 has been in the low teens of 11.1% year-on-year, significantly better than its year-ago growth rate of 7.8%. Nevertheless, Sun Pharma’s generic revenue growth in the US remains at risk, mainly due to the nature of the industry, which continues to see price erosion."

While the firm recalled sumatriptan succinate from the world’s largest pharmaceutical market due to presence of impurities in the medicine, batches of testosterone cypionate were recalled due to deviations from good manufacturing practice norms at the facility where it was made. The recall of sumatriptan succinate was started last month, while that of testosterone cypionate was initiated last week, as per US FDA data. Testosterone cypionate, used to treat low testosterone levels in men and in hormone therapy for transgender men, was manufactured by Sun Pharma at one of the company’s plants in Gujarat. The company has recalled 207,585 blisters and another 384 bottles of 100 sumatriptan succinate tablets each in the voluntary class II recall, the data showed. Testosterone cypionate was also a class II recall. A recall is designated class II if exposure to a product may cause temporary or medically-reversible adverse health consequences.

Sales rose 14% year-on-year (y-o-y) in the month, led by an increase in anti-infective and respiratory therapies, according to data from market research firm AIOCD Awacs. It must be noted that November has been the best month in more than 32 months, shows the AIOCD Awacs data. In October, revenue growth had been soft at 5%, while volumes had declined. The growth in November was driven by volumes, which increased 5.9%, followed by a 5.7% rise in prices, and new products that were up 3%. The growth is on the back of a lower base from a year ago, when sales grew by about 7%. Analysts said the volume growth data was encouraging. “The pick up in volumes is the highlight after a negative volume growth of about 2.7% in October. Overall volume growth has been better this year. Additionally, Indian pharma companies outperformed multinational companies, which happened for the first time in the last six months. The domestic pharma market continues to remain strong,"" notes Kunal Dhamesha, pharma analyst at SBI Capital Markets Ltd. While this year’s growth has been on the back of a lower base, a few firms managed to better market growth rates. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd posted the highest y-o-y growth at 28%, while Lupin Ltd and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd each reported 15% growth. Given the extended monsoon season, sales of anti-infective and respiratory drugs grew the fastest in November. Besides, analysts expect the domestic market to continue to do well as lifestyle diseases are on the rise. A positive is that the growth was broad-based across categories. Respiratory and anti-infectives grew at about 20% and 17%, respectively, y-o-y. Gastrointestinals also clocked a growth rate of about 15% y-o-y. However, risks to the domestic pharma market could come from a revision in the National List of Essential Medicines. This constitutes about 10% of the domestic pharma market. Another factor to watch for would be growth rates post the acute season. Sales growth could tend to slow down in the coming months. The pharma market penetration is still considered low in India, even as the affordability of drugs has been rising. However, the game seems to be shifting in favour of firms that have a strong domestic formulations portfolio. In short, the action is likely to become more stock-centric."

The stock surged immediately after the results and ended Thursday about 3% higher. Overall, Q2 revenues were about 16.1% higher than a year ago, driven by steady growth in its home market and integration of the Pola Pharma Inc. business in Japan in the rest of the world business. Sun Pharma’s profit before tax increased by about 8% year-on-year (y-o-y).  The US market, however, has been seeing signs of sluggishness. Revenues from this region were flat compared with last year. Analysts have noted that headline growth has been largely in line with estimates, though US sales, excluding sales of its subsidiary Taro Pharmaceuticals, were much weaker than anticipated. However, the product market in the US is predicted to improve in the coming quarters, but it will depend on how many new drugs the company can launch in the overseas market. The company has about 103 abbreviated new drug approvals awaiting the US FDA nod. Sun Pharma received approvals for seven ANDAs, enlarging its US pipeline to 54 approved new drug applications. A big positive was the ramp up in its India operations due to a spate of product launches. This segment delivered the highest-ever quarterly sales growth of the last six years, rising 35% y-o-y. “The India business was a good surprise and aided margins due to a favourable geographical mix in revenue growth. An increase in new launches and improvement in secondary sales were good signs. Overall, the margin beat was positive,"" said Krishnanath Munde, pharma analyst, Reliance Securities Ltd. Research and development expenses fell as a proportion of revenue. Consolidated R&D expenses in Q2 FY20 were ₹488 crore, about 6.1% of revenue. This compares well with Q2 FY19’s ₹452 crore, which was about 6.6% of revenue. The product-mix change, though, seemed to crimp margin growth. Despite strong revenue growth of about 16%, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization grew only 12%. Besides, expenses related to the marketing of specialty products dented the Ebitda margin. However, the Ebitda margin was a touch higher than analysts estimated, which seems to have had a positive effect on the stock. The stock trades at a one-year forward price earnings of about 20. Since the beginning of this year, the stock has been seeing signs of consolidation, yet the outlook for the US and India operations is key. Also, in the coming quarters, the Street will also be looking for a ramp up in its specialty products."

Following the Halol plant’s positive review by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) in mid-August, news reports suggest that whistle-blower’s allegations against the company may continue to be an overhang. Earlier, reports indicated that a preliminary enquiry committee set up by the capital market regulator found no merit in the allegations, driving the stock prices higher by 6.2% over the last three trading days. In the past three months, the Sun Pharma stock has also outperformed the Nifty Pharma index. Yet, the overhang may not yet be over as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is yet to communicate its final decision to Sun Pharma. Note that the whistle-blower allegations have kept the stock under pressure for some time now. The stock has lost 35% from its peak in September 2018. “The corporate governance issue has been a big overhang on the Sun Pharma stock. If you consider the news of Sebi’s investigation of not finding anything wrong in terms of divergence of funds, as well as on foreign fund-raising, to be true, then this huge concern is now behind. If there is no clean chit, there could be further volatility. A positive has been that its Halol plant has got a clean chit from the US FDA,"" said Krishnanath Munde, pharma analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd. Besides, the progress over its first-quarter performance needs to be considered. Its specialty chemicals business, where analysts had pencilled better growth rates, undershot the Street’s expectations. Recently, Sun Pharma said it was developing an early-stage pipeline for its specialty business. So, that may be an advantage. Additionally, the domestic business has reported decent growth, while the US one has also been steady. Operating margins have held steady, boosting Q1 FY20 net profit, which was up 31% year-on-year. However, there are not too many triggers. “One trigger for the stock would be an uptick in the US specialty business,"" notes Munde. Hence, for investors, being on the fence and waiting for more clarity from Sebi may do no harm. It will also give them time to evaluate whether Sun Pharma is building on its Q1 FY20 performance."

A report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, released on Monday, estimates more Indian companies will enter the pharma industry in China through joint ventures. Major pharmaceutical companies in India like Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Aurobindo Pharma Ltd, Cipla Ltd and Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd are looking at China as a big opportunity, making the market one of the focus areas for future growth. “Indian companies are seeking partners that can make tangible business contributions, safeguard IP, ensure operational control and manage talent,"" said the report. Five joint ventures are already in place in China. Dr Reddy’s has identified 70 products from its US portfolio that meet requirements and can obtain approval from Chinese authorities in coming years. The company is building a new plant, upgrading teams and building a pipeline for China. Aurobindo Pharma is next in line to construct a facility in China. The company expects commercialisation of its products in the next 2-2.5 years. There is also a joint venture for inhaler products which will start operating soon. Early in July, Cipla said it was setting up a joint venture with a Chinese pharmaceutical company to manufacture and sell drugs. They are in the process of setting up a facility in China. “The company is looking at both routes--manufacturing in India and exporting to China as well as looking at potential facilities in China--for oncology,"" the report further says. In May, Sun Pharmaceutical said it had entered into licensing agreements with China Medical System Holdings to develop and commercialise drugs to treat psoriasis and dry eye in Greater China. According to the company, there is a strong interest in China for products which it has global rights. Alembic Pharmaceutical has also announced its interest in China. According to the report by analyst Girish Bakhru, the recent renewed interest in China has stemmed from healthcare reforms in the country that aim to reduce drug prices and increase competition and the quality of generics. “Given high fragmentation, complex distribution, high hospital channel share, language and cultural barriers, most Indian firms are opting for joint ventures in China. Efforts are visible across the board as companies put China as one of the focus areas for future growth,"" added the report by Bakhru. In an announcement on Monday Strides Pharma Science Limited (Strides) said that its step down subsidiary Strides Pharma Global Pte, Singapore (SPG) has entered into a joint venture (JV) with Sun Moral International (HK) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group Ltd (Sihuan), one of China’s leading pharmaceutical companies. According to the statement, the JV will fast track Strides’ entry into China. “The recent regulatory developments in China has enabled fast track approvals of differentiated high-quality generics approved in key regulated markets. Strides’ specialized basket of 140+ products qualifies for the program, and this JV will be able to leverage it in China,"" said the company. The spending on medicines in China is expected to reach $140 billion to $170 billion by 2023, reckons research firm IQVIA."
Updated: 30 May 2019,How ethical dilemmas tailed Sun Pharma’s rise,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/how-ethical-dilemmas-tailed-sun-pharma-s-rise-1559147718106.html,"No single form of growth-driving pharma marketing in India’s generic drug space of the 1990s could be totally free from controversy. Marketing strategies, including that of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, which promoted a long-term relationship with doctors, polarized professionals. But was there a choice? Most large companies, which stuck to what they perceived as “ethical marketing"" were slipping into a slow-growth zone. “Sarabhai and some multinationals were fastidious in maintaining hygiene in marketing practices, and a sanitized distance between the doctor and the medical representative (MR) was built into the relationship they cultivated. Some of these companies considered giving anything more than a pen as a gift (to be) a sacrilege. Many of us did go through the initial ethical dilemma of whether what we were doing was the right thing,"" a professional who had joined Sun said. Since Sun was changing the game and bringing new drugs to India, it couldn’t afford to play by the old rules and hope to be effective. They had a duty to inform the doctor about how a new drug behaves within the body. Also, Sun was meant to shape the market for chronic drugs. This, by its very definition, was generating business through the lifelong prescriptions of specialists, and in that business landscape, long-term sustainable relationships with doctors were the only framework they had to operate in. (Founder of Sun Pharma Dilip) Shanghvi also went through the arduous grind an MR faces daily—competing with others in sweat and dust, turned away from a doctor’s door after an endless wait. If he could offer something of value to the doctor, he would have an advantage over his peers. Before Sun, Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd (a competitor) had started forging closer ties with medical bodies like the Neurological Society of India, Cardiological Society of India and the Indian Psychiatric Society. Its founder U.N. Mehta had served as an MR for years and understood the struggle foot soldiers go through just to get a few minutes to tell a drug’s story to the doctor. He started sponsoring conferences, promoting them as platforms MRs could use to mingle with their demigods. This strategy succeeded for Torrent in oiling its customer relations and was adopted in various avatars by Sun, Intas, and others. The conference fee game At Sun, (Sundaresh) Raju christened the strategy “Scientific and Academic Services (SAS)"". In its basic unrefined form, it meant sponsoring top prescribers to attend medical conferences. “Through SAS, I wanted to give a clear message that it was not a way of spending money on doctors. That spend has to be with a purpose, that being it should ultimately help doctors treat their patients better (with drugs Sun sold),"" Shanghvi said. When (Shyamal) Ghosh’s friends from multinational companies (MNCs) derided such practices as inducements to doctors, he tried explaining it to them as he had been told. “The guys we sponsor for conferences are celebrated specialists and have practices that earn them lakhs every month. Offering them these things for an academic pursuit is like offering them loose change. One must keep in mind that … they could feel awkward when they land in a different city. We wish to take away that headache,"" he clarified. Ghosh, T.K. Roy, and other Sun insiders emphasized that unlike other companies which sponsored a lot of foreign junkets, Sun kept it domestic and restricted it to medical conference venues, a move that suited the company’s values and pockets. “Marketing spends couldn’t be on fun trips as many other firms were practising. This devalued the relationship and made it transactional. It eroded respect for the company and was not sustainable,"" Raju said. Reflecting on the practices he named a quarter-century ago, Raju said “services"" in SAS was an integral component in the whole framework and literally meant devotion. Raju laughed off any reference to the company’s marketing strategies as a “grey zone"". “There is no grey here because we knew our lines and didn’t cross them. Those who referred to it as grey either misunderstood or misinterpreted it,"" he asserted. Rivals and detractors claimed that Sun smartly wrapped its commercial motive in a feel-good, emotionally appealing package. “The shrewd ways Sun developed customer relations under various heads can never be caught. Connect it to academics by a long stretch of imagination, and suddenly every form of marketing, even when they were spending so much, becomes palatable to doctors. Highlight the emotional connect, and suddenly the very motive of that relation, which is business, doesn’t sound vulgar. Retrospectively, they outbid all competitors by practising a strategy which people in the industry took a long time to grasp,"" a top executive of a rival firm admitted with grudging admiration of the model. He pointed out that behind all the emotion was a cautious arithmetic justifying the business. Sun picked the doctors it wanted to invest in very carefully, classified them into high-return, medium-return and low-return, depending on factors like patient flows, the number of prescriptions generated, and retail sales audit. This marketing spends to sales, according to several former insiders, was roughly 1:10. They however explained that it wasn’t designed to be the quid-pro-quo that it is now being made out to be by some rivals. In fact, the rationale of such a classification was to make best use of the time and energy of the limited number of MRs Sun had at the time. The chosen set of doctors was sponsored for medical conferences year after year. Sun devised ways to help their patient flows, expand their market, and, in turn, its own—by bringing new drugs in their therapies and quenching the academic thirst of doctors in ways that the medical industry in India had not witnessed till then. Sun spent its marketing budget on doctors by gifting them books, which they wanted but were not inclined to buy. Doctors in Calcutta credited Sun with building their libraries over the years. This was a practice which was later emulated by most other firms flogging psychiatric drugs. Book dole-outs Once we had started doing well, boss exhorted us to do things differently and introduce some new practices. (Marketing director) Subbarao (Chaganti) had just authored a book on pharma marketing and that became the first book we distributed,"" Roy recounted. Subsequently, Subbarao introduced Shyamal Ghosh and T.K. Roy to P.T. Rajasekaran, who ran Panther Publishers in Bengaluru. They met Rajasekaran and thrashed out a deal. Rajasekaran reached out to major international medical publishers. He brought to the table a commitment to buy books in bulk at discounted prices and print them in India. On their part, international publishers would have to promise to make it a limited exclusive edition and not bring those titles to India for at least six months. It made sense for most international publishers because their books priced upwards of $20 were not popular with bookshops. By the late 1990s, medical soirees had not only been adopted by many more companies but were also getting grander, hosted in foreign locales, and plush five-star hotels. Sun consciously opted for a venue away from the city, where there wasn’t much to do even if you got away from the conference hall. Some industry veterans, however, hurl accusations at Sun’s practices. “As a pure business strategy, SAS was a stroke of absolute brilliance.Many companies which made a noise about Sun polluting the market initially, ended up blatantly aping its marketing moves. Even then, they couldn’t copy the execution, which has set Sun apart. But when it comes to ethics, I couldn’t out Sun above others. In the pharma marketing practices of the Indian market, if doctors and pharma companies went to bed together, you could not absolve Sun from that responsibility,"" a top executive of a rival firm felt. Shanghvi said, “My belief from day one is that the doctor will support the company only if he respects it. If I do anything to reduce the respect of a doctor, I will attain suboptimal results. Above that, I have a resource constraint and I have to operate within that to earn their respect. So we focused on training our MRs on scientific awareness. My advantage was that I was an outsider, so I was not viewing things from a coloured perspective. I saw the problems just as they were and sought solutions that would work."" Emotional connect Cardiologists and psychiatrists agreed on the emotional connect. A senior cardiologist from Mumbai was in Delhi to attend a medical conference in the winter of 1999. His trip was being sponsored by one of Sun’s rivals. Early in the morning, he broke into a cold sweat, panting for breath, and felt his heart sinking. Being a cardiologist, he could diagnose himself and the first call he made was to a manager of Sun, managing to utter, “Kunal, I am having a heart attack."" One came across several such cases of Sun boys rushing to help when doctors turned patients. Ethics in the pharma industry continues to be a sticky subject. While responding to the word “ethical"", a number of doctors, particularly psychiatrists, perceived Sun as more ethical than its competitors. Factors that helped the perception included continuity of the same people over years, which made specialists familiar and comfortable with Sun boys, prompting most to conclude that there must be something good about the firm. The second factor was that Sun boys wouldn’t commit to something that they couldn’t do. They felt Sun operated under broadly set guidelines, which empowered the first-line managers to take decisions and stick to it. Some drew a strangely abstract connection between ethics and Sun’s academic orientation in marketing. Somehow, Sun’s gifts of books and journals, its promptness in helping consultants build their name by publishing and presenting their papers, and the academic events made it appear more “ethical"". The seed for the credibility Sun enjoyed among psychiatrists, cardiologists and endocrinologists were probably sown in 1992-93. Shanghvi, early in his career when he was working in the field, was sitting with a senior specialist who told him, “A senior bureaucrat’s wife was here and I prescribed her an MNC’s product."" It was a product that Sun was also selling. Shanghvi recalled, “What was important was this: he not only prescribed a med of an MNC, but also said it to me, which meant he took pride in his action. With no amount of convincing, would I get him to prescribe my meds unless I earned his respect and trust? With this realization, our focus to earn the customer’s respect got stronger. It’s this in-depth understanding of the doctor’s behaviour that helped us design our policies. We were clear that it is through our actions that we have to earn his respect because I have no parents sitting in the US and Europe who have created a legacy of credibility. Either I create it through my actions or I don’t get it."" At a time when large MNCs and Indian giants like Sarabhai kept a distance between MRs and doctors, and fast-growing lifestyle drug companies jumped to do anything, Sun chose the middle path. It spent heavily on marketing and doctors but made the core incentives it offered academic. This made the favours appear acceptable to the community, which was struggling to cope with the rapid transition in the pharma industry, and was stuck in a moral dilemma between the temptations dangled by the corporate sector and a conscience call. One elderly psychiatrist called it a pull between “Lakshmi"" (the goddess of wealth) and “Saraswati"" (the goddess of knowledge). “Sun’s Lakshmi (marketing spend on doctors) came as Saraswati (academic focus of marketing), resolving a deep-seated conflict in the doctors’ minds and making it acceptable to our community,"" the psychiatrist concluded.

Updated: 29 May 2019,Sun Pharma faces the heat as Q4 profit halves; Valia’s role reduced,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/sun-pharmaceutical-faces-the-heat-as-q4-profit-halves-valia-s-role-reduced-1559071817609.html,"NEW DELHI : Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd reported a 53% drop in quarterly profit after it took a ₹1,085 crore one-time charge, following a corporate governance scandal that also led to founder Dilip Shanghvi’s brother-in-law moving to a non-executive role. Net profit fell to ₹635.9 crore in the quarter ended 31 March from ₹1,342 crore in the year earlier, India’s largest drug maker said in a stock exchange filing on Tuesday. Sudhir Valia, brother-in law of Shanghvi, will become a non-executive director from whole-time director with effect from Wednesday. The move follows corporate governance allegations related to Valia raised by a whistle-blower. Sun pharma now faces an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. A 150-page complaint by the whistle-blower filed with the capital markets regulator that emerged last November alleged various irregularities by the company and its promoters. From 1 November till date, Sun Pharma has lost $5.4 billion in market value. The whistle-blower letter highlighted Sun Pharma’s dealing with subsidiary Aditya Medisales Ltd (AML), a drugs distributor that is also classified as a promoter shareholder of Sun Pharma with a stake of 1.6% as of December-end. It alleged that AML had lent to companies run by Valia. Concerns have since been raised by investors over whether AML made any gains in the past at the cost of Sun Pharma. Sun Pharma discontinued its domestic business tie-up with AML and Shanghvi assured investors that shareholders were never disadvantaged in the transactions with AML. In order to deal with the allegations and further reassure investors, Valia stepped down to take a non-executive role, Sun Pharma said on Tuesday. The company, in a media statement accompanying the filing, said the reported profit was not comparable with the fourth quarter of last year because of the one-time impact of distribution change for its domestic business. “Sales for the quarter included a one-time impact of about ₹1,085 crore related to the change in distribution for India business,"" the statement said. Consolidated revenue was ₹7,044.26 crore for the quarter under consideration, up from ₹6,711.01 crore for the same period a year ago. “In spite of the one-time impact for India business, our full-year sales have grown by double digits. We continue to focus on executing our global specialty strategy,"" said Shanghvi. Independent analyst Ambareesh Baliga said: “Though the numbers were lower than analyst expectations, but if accounted for the one-off sales adjusted due to change of distribution for India business, they offer some optimistic cues. US business has shown robust traction with 20% growth, especially when analysts had reduced weightage due to margin pressure. The whistle-blower complaint, which bogged down the stock in the last few months, seems to have relegated to the background, with no further information or development on the same."""

The antitrust lawsuit was filed by 40 US states on 10 May and is based on a five-year investigation of the firms. Other Indian generic drug makers named in the lawsuit are Aurobindo Pharma Ltd, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Lupin Ltd, Wockhardt Ltd and Zydus Pharma. The lawsuit accuses 20 drug makers of conspiring to inflate prices of more than 100 different drugs, significantly broadening a 2016 complaint. In addition to the states, the justice department’s antitrust division is conducting a criminal probe. The complaint is an expanded document of suit, which is still under litigation and was filed by US states in December 2016. ALSO WATCH: The states claim that the drug makers conspired with one another to fix prices and carve up markets for medicines among themselves, rather than compete on price. Executives used industry dinners, cocktail parties and golf outings to perpetuate the scheme, in addition to communicating through text messages and telephone calls, the complaint said. Indian pharma stocks declined in Mumbai on Monday. BSE’s healthcare index fell 3.53% to 13,310.47 points. Shares of Sun Pharmaceuticals plunged 21% in intraday trading, but ended the day down 9.39% to ₹396.85 on the BSE. Dr Reddy’s fell 2.5% to ₹2,804.95. A Sun Pharmaceutical spokesperson said, “We believe the allegations made in these lawsuits are without merit and we will continue to vigorously defend against them."" The US complaint puts Teva at the centre of the conspiracy, saying it colluded with a core group of competitors to follow each other’s price increases. During a 19-month period from 2013 to 2015, Teva significantly raised prices on about 112 generic drugs and colluded with its competitors on at least 86 medicines, the states said. While the size of the increases varied, some were more than 1,000%. “Teva is a consistent participant in the conspiracies identified in this complaint, but the conduct is pervasive and industry-wide,"" according to the complaint that was filed in federal court in Connecticut. “Through its senior-most executives and account managers, Teva participated in a wide-ranging series of restraints with more than a dozen generic drug manufacturers, all of whom knowingly and willingly participated."" In a statement, Kelley Dougherty, a Teva vice-president, said, “The allegations in this new complaint and in the litigation more generally, are just that—allegations."" The US states are seeking unspecified damages and penalties from the firms. Potential fines could exceed $2 billion, given that generic drug firms were making higher profits during the time in question, said Steven Tepper, an analyst at Israel Brokerage and Investments. That strikes a blow to Teva, struggling to pay back $29 billion of debt—a sum almost twice its market value. “We have hard evidence that shows the generic-drug industry perpetrated a multi-billion dollar fraud on the American people,"" Connecticut attorney general William Tong said in a statement on Friday. “We all wonder why our healthcare, and specifically the prices for generic prescription drugs, are so expensive in this country—this is a big reason why."" The firms have argued that price increases were due to factors such as industry consolidation and regulator-mandated plant closures."

Updated: 26 Jul 2016,"Teva, Mylan eye Pfizer’s Brazil venture: report",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/2N3YXWRrlg8fMi0mkWBOsL/Teva-Mylan-eye-Pfizers-Brazil-venture-report.html," Sao Paulo: Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Mylan NV have shown preliminary interest in a Brazilian generic drug making joint-venture in which Pfizer Inc has a 40% stake, two people familiar with the process said. India’s Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and three buyout firms are also eyeing the venture, Laboratório Teut|Pfizer, said the people, who asked for anonymity since the process is in early stages. Brazil’s Melo family owns the remaining 60% of Teuto|Pfizer, Latin America’s largest pharmaceutical plant. After agreeing to exit Teuto|Pfizer two months ago, the Melos and Pfizer hired the investment-banking units of Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Grupo BTG Pactual SA to oversee the plan, the people said. There is not yet a deadline for submitting proposals for Teuto|Pfizer, the people said. Teuto|Pfizer, in the center-west Brazilian city of Anápolis, declined to comment, as did Pfizer. In an email to Reuters, Israeli generic drugs maker Teva said it would not comment on market rumours. Sun Pharmaceutical, UK-headquartered Mylan, Goldman Sachs and BTG Pactual did not have an immediate comment. The sale underscores the challenge facing generic drugmakers in Brazil, where a weaker currency has stoked raw materials costs and the harshest recession in eight decades has slowed sales. Pfizer will decide this year whether to globally exit generic drugs, after plans to buy rival Allergan Inc collapsed. Generic drug sales in Brazil, Latin America’s largest economy, expanded 10% last year, slowing from 15% growth in 2014, industry data showed. Revenue from sales of generic drugs in Brazil topped 46 billion reais ($14 billion) last year. Option The people declined to detail the price the Melos and Pfizer, the biggest US drugmaker, want for Teuto. Pfizer paid $240 million for the Teuto stake six years ago, to enter Brazil’s then-buoyant generic drug market. At the time, Walderci de Melo, who bought Teuto in 1986 with his brother Lucimar, negotiated terms of an option that gave Pfizer the right to acquire the remainder of Teuto|Pfizer at 14.4 times operational profit between 2014 and 2016, one of the people said. However, Pfizer’s potential exit from generic drugs and disagreements with the Melos over strategy got in the way of a deal, the people said. Bets similar to those that Pfizer made in Brazil, the world’s third-largest market for the segment, have yielded mixed results, according to industry analysts. For instance, France’s Sanofi SA has had to record charges related to the booking of excess inventory at Medley Indústria Farmacêutica Ltda, for which it paid $660 million in 2009. Reuters"
Updated: 23 Jun 2016,Sun Pharma’s anti-bacterial drug being recalled in US market,https://www.livemint.com/Companies/yHEMXXAZ8UfAy5FDf79FGK/Sun-Pharmas-antibacterial-drug-being-recalled-in-US-market.html," New Delhi: As many as 2,839 bottles of anti-bacterial medicine Nitrofurantoin Oral Suspension manufactured by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries are being recalled in the US market on account of failed dissolution specifications. The ongoing nationwide voluntary recall by Nostrum Laboratories Inc. for Nitrofurantoin Oral Suspension, USP, 25 mg/5 ml is a class II recall, according to the latest enforcement report on the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) website. The 2,839 bottles were manufactured and distributed by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, it added. Citing reasons for the recall, the USFDA said it was due to “failed dissolution specifications"". Nitrofurantoin oral suspension, USP is specifically indicated for the treatment of urinary tract infections. As per the USFDA, a class II recall is initiated in a “situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote""."
Updated: 01 Jun 2016,Sun Pharma: Adjusting to the new reality,https://www.livemint.com/Money/Sws3L1pGf7VrMaHpIC9yHP/Sun-Pharma-adjusting-to-the-new-reality.html," The Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd stock fell 6.13% on BSE on Tuesday, after the announcement of the company’s results on Monday. What led to the plunge? It wasn’t the company’s 1.8% sales growth in FY16, because that was not much of a surprise, as the management had indicated as much. What shocked investors is its sales growth projection for FY17. An 8-10% sales growth is not what they expected, and even a proposed share buyback did little to lift spirits. In fact, the company’s March quarter numbers were quite good. It has been selling its generic version of cancer drug Gleevec in the US market since February, and will be the sole generic product for six months. That allows it to earn substantial revenues and profits in this period. That’s why US formulation sales were up by 22.2% sequentially in the March quarter. Growth will be good in the June quarter as well, when the full impact of the launch will be felt and will taper September quarter onwards. This launch has helped Sun Pharma overcome a challenging US generic market, due to price competition, consolidation among customers (institutions that procure and sell drugs to patients) and supply constraints. Supply constraints are mainly due to remediation efforts at Halol to make it compliant again with US FDA’s standards. Sales growth in India was up by 16.7% while that in emerging markets and rest of the world markets was slower (affected by currency volatility and supply constraints). Sun Pharma’s profitability improved, up by 2.4 percentage points sequentially, part of which can be attributed to sales of generic Gleevec. The profitability improvement looks dramatic, over a year ago, but that was partly due to charges related to the merger of Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd in the March 2015 quarter. Is Sun Pharma’s management being too cautious? They got their previous guidance right, adding credibility to the new guidance. They have also factored in the Halol facility coming back into play some time during the fiscal year. If not, investors could have factored this in as a surprise. In India, a decline in the Wholesale Price Index has affected price increases for FY17 of medicines under price control. Also, the ban on fixed dose combinations may affect growth to an extent. On top of this, the management said it expects research and development expenses to be 9% of sales in 2016-17, compared with 8.3% in 2015-16. What could cause a surprise, therefore, are factors mostly not in its control. One could be, if the Halol facility inspection gets clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration earlier than expected, and improved supplies lead to better sales growth. A more stable foreign currency environment in developing markets can be another positive factor. Positive news flows on its research programmes is yet another factor.

Updated: 31 May 2016,Sun Pharma falls most in 10 months on March quarter results,https://www.livemint.com/Money/pVJulop6QJNHB8XNbMPopI/Sun-Pharma-shares-drop-57-after-results.html," Mumbai: Shares of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd closed 6.13% lower, posting their worst fall in 10 months, a day after the company posted lower-than-expected March quarter earnings. In morning trade, the stock fell as much as 6.81% to touch a low of ₹ 757.10, a level last seen on 22 December, logging the steepest fall since 21 December. So far this year, the stock has fallen 7%. The company reported a net profit of ₹ 1,713.69 crore for the fourth quarter of 2015-16, up 92% from a year ago. Net sales rose 17.7% to ₹ 7,413.87 crore. This was lower than what analysts were expecting. According to a Bloomberg poll of 19 analysts, the company was expected to post a net profit of ₹ 1,908.9 crore, while 13 analysts expected net sales at ₹ 7,764.60 crore. One reason for this was that R&D (research and development) investments rose to 8.3% of sales in the fiscal year compared with 7.2% during the previous year. The company also continues to dodge regulatory issues. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had banned products manufactured at Ranbaxy’s Indian plants from entering the US after the violation of good manufacturing practices. Ranbaxy’s Indian plants which were hit include plants in Mohali, Dewas, Paonta Sahib and Toansa. Last week, Sun Pharma’s US arm had received summons from the antitrust division of the US department of justice (DoJ), requiring it to appear before a grand jury there. In a conference call on Tuesday morning, Dilip Shanghvi, managing director of Sun Pharmaceuticals, said that the company is cooperating with the DoJ and providing the necessary details. He declined to elaborate, but added that it is not a product-specific investigation. “We expect continued pressures on the base business and see challenges for the company as it grapples with issues around Halol, Ranbaxy integration as well as base effect and pricing pressures in the US,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities in a note to its investors. The brokerage has a “sell"" rating on the stock and has reduced its target price to ₹ 760 a share from ₹ 825 a share."
Updated: 01 Jun 2016,FDA may inspect one Ranbaxy plant in fiscal 2017: Dilip Shanghvi,https://www.livemint.com/Home-Page/VlWOrx06q728KBJG04D26O/FDA-inspections-at-Ranbaxy-plants-expected-in-FY17-says-Dil.html," Mumbai: India’s largest drug maker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd on Tuesday said the US drug regulator may start re-inspecting by the middle of 2016-17 one of the four Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd plants banned from exporting to the US. The US Food and Drugs Administration (USFDA) had banned products from Ranbaxy’s plants in Mohali, Dewas, Paonta Sahib in 2012, and Toansa in 2014, from exporting to the US, after the company was found to have violated good manufacturing practices. Sun Pharma, which agreed to acquire Ranbaxy in an all-stock transaction at an enterprise value of $4 billion in April 2014, had said in December 2015 that remedial actions at Ranbaxy plants were on track. Speaking at a conference call on Tuesday, Sun Pharma managing director Dilip Shanghvi said a total synergy of about $300 million can be expected by FY18 through Ranbaxy integration. The Ranbaxy acquisition, which was completed in March 2015, made Sun Pharma the world’s fifth-largest specialty generic pharmaceuticals company. “We are working towards the fulfilment of the requirements of the US consent decree and will try to expedite the resolution for at least one of these facilities,"" Shanghvi had said in December. Sun Pharma has recorded a 92% rise in consolidated net profit for the March quarter at ₹ 1,714 crore from ₹ 889 crore a year ago. For the full financial year, the group posted a net profit of ₹ 4,716 crore, up 4% from ₹ 4,540 crore for the year ended 31 March 2015. Total income increased to ₹ 28,729 crore from ₹ 27,843 crore during the previous fiscal, up 3%. For FY16, sales from the US market were $2 billion, recording a decline of 8%. Shanghvi said that sales in the US got adversely impacted by pricing competition. The company expects its newly acquired branded drug business in Japan will generate revenue from second half of FY17. In March, Sun Pharma had acquired Novartis’ branded drug portfolio in Japan for $293 million. Last week, Sun Pharma’s US arm had received summons from the antitrust division of the US department of justice (DoJ), requiring it to appear before a grand jury there. However, Shanghvi did not disclose the details while saying the company is cooperating with the DoJ and providing the details and that it’s not a product-specific investigation. The US DoJ had sought documents relating to corporate and employee records, generic pharmaceutical products and pricing, communications with competitors and others regarding sales of generic pharmaceutical products and certain other related matters. “This has been a year of consolidation for us. While we have accrued targeted synergies from the Ranbaxy acquisition, we have also made commensurate investments in building the specialty business in the US. These strategic investments will help us drive the sustainable growth of our business,"" Shanghvi said during the result announcement. Sun Pharma is ranked No. 1 and holds approximately 8.8% market share in the ₹ 98,000 crore pharmaceutical market, according to the March 2016 AIOCD-AWACS report."

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd plunged the most on record after saying revenue will remain flat or decline as it combines a rival it bought last year. Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) fell for a third day after its first-quarter profit and sales trailed estimates. HDFC Bank Ltd, the biggest lender by value, decreased the most in two weeks amid an increase in bad loans. The S&P BSE Sensex lost 0.8% to 28,182.14 at the close. The Parliament failed to transact any business on the first day of the monsoon session as opposition demanded resignations of three key members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party over graft allegations. Modi is seeking to pass bills needed to implement a national sales tax by April, one of the nation’s biggest reform proposals in decades. “The bills are critical for our growth and need to be passed,"" Pankaj Murarka, head of equities at Mumbai-based Axis Asset Management Co., which has $4.5 billion, said on Tuesday. Sun Pharmaceutical plunged 15%, the most since its trading debut in December 1994. Sun Pharma Advanced Research, a group company, tumbled 6.2%. Profit may be “adversely impacted"" in the year to 31 March, weighed by some costs and charges linked to the merger with Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd, the company said in a filing Monday after market hours. Sun Pharmaceutical was the worst performer on a gauge of drug makers, which tumbled 5.9%, the most since October 2008. Cipla Ltd tumbled 3% and Lupin Ltd plunged 4.7%, the most since 17 April. Earnings recovery With concerns easing over Greece’s crisis and China’s market collapse, investor attention has shifted to corporate profitability. Sensex company profits have declined for two straight quarters. “Earnings in the first half of the current fiscal year will remain soft,"" Murarka said. “We will see some uptick in only in the second half."" HDFC Bank retreated 1.5%. The bank’s profit rose 21% to ₹ 2700 crore, matching the median estimate of 31 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Provisions against bad loans increased 51% to ₹ 728 crore. Infosys Ltd, India’s second-biggest software exporter, jumped 11%, the most in more than two years after the company raised its annual sales forecast. Sales in the year started 1 April will climb 7.2% to 9.2% in US dollar terms, the company said on Tuesday. That compares with an April forecast for growth of 6.2% to 8.2%. Infosys joined larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) in reporting profit for the June quarter that beat or matched estimates. Wipro Ltd, the third-biggest software maker, added 1.69%. HCL Technologies Ltd climbed 2.91%. Bharti Airtel Ltd rallied 3.7% to its highest level since May 2009 after the company said Orange SA is in talks to acquire four of its African businesses. Global investors bought a net $124 million of domestic stocks on 20 July, taking this year’s inflows to $7.3 billion. The Sensex has risen 2.5% this year and trades at 15.7 times projected 12-month earnings. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is valued at a multiple of 11.6. Bloomberg"
Updated: 21 Jul 2015,Sun Pharma shares fall record 15% on profit warning,https://www.livemint.com/Money/R1PiQo0mfLV0bKSVA0ygzL/Sun-Pharma-shares-fall-16-as-merger-with-Ranbaxy-hurts-prof.html," Mumbai: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd on Tuesday saw the biggest-ever fall in its stock prices after the company issued a profit warning. The stock lost 15% to close at ₹ 805.30 apiece. In intraday trade, the stock fell as much as 15.6%, the most since 26 June 2009 and touched a low of ₹ 799.05—a level last seen on 17 December 2014. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries warned that its revenue and profit for the current fiscal year are likely to be “adversely impacted"" because of costs and charges related to integrating Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd and resolving manufacturing issues at the acquired company’s plants, Mint reported. The country’s largest drug maker by sales expects consolidated revenue to either remain flat or show a decline from a year earlier. Profit can also be hurt because of costs related to the corrective steps to be taken to make Ranbaxy’s India plants compliant with US drug manufacturing standards, it added. The ratings firm Nomura has cut the stock to “reduce"" from “neutral"" and also reduced its target to 9.9% to ₹ 792 a share, Bloomberg reported. The company has not yet declare the date for announcement for its June quarter earnings. But according to 25 analyst of Bloomberg the company may post net profit of ₹ 1,077 crore while net sales will be at ₹ 6,672.5 crore. “In our view, the guidance implies: a longer timeline for revival and greater uncertainty around supplies from Halol; more severe pricing pressure and limited scope of price increases; and of high-impact approvals in the US other than Gleevec in FY16,"" Saion Mukherjee, a research analyst with Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a note on Tuesday. Market capitalization of the company eroded by ₹ 34,050 crore to ₹ 193,784.45 crore. Other healthcare companies also closed lower. Sun Pharma Advanced Research Co Ltd fell 5.5%, Glenmark Pharma Ltd fell 2.7%, Lupin Ltd fell 5.1%, Unichem Labs Ltd fell 2.7%, Cipla Ltd fell 2.8%.

The 30-share BSE Sensex gained 114.71 points, or 0.59%, to 19,439.48 while the National Stock Exchange’s 50-share Nifty advanced 47.45 points, or 0.82%, to close at 5,859 points. The Sensex had lost 171.05 points on Monday. Buying by mutual funds and retail investors, tracking a firming trend on other Asian bourses, following overnight gains in the US, supported the trading sentiment here, according to brokers. “The market is drawing comfort from the fact that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will not let the rupee slip below 61,"" Gajendra Nagpal, chief executive officer at Unicon Financial Intermediaries Ltd., said by phone from New Delhi. “If foreign investors get the feeling that the regulators will support the rupee at 61 then they will start deploying funds. So far, they have been on the sidelines as they had not seen a strong signal from the RBI about supporting the currency."" The Sensex has dropped 3.1% since May 22, when US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank will slow stimulus if the US economy shows sustainable improvement. That spurred global funds to sell emerging-market assets. Foreign investors pulled a net $1.76 billion of local shares in June, the highest most August 2011, data from the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India, or Sebi, show. The rupee gained 0.5% to 60.33 after RBI barred banks from proprietary trading in currency futures and exchange-traded options. Sebi said on Tuesday it will raise margin requirements and curtail open positions from 11 July. The rupee weakened 4.9 % in June, the most since May 2012. Among the Asia-Pacific markets, Japan’s Nikkei gained 2.58% to close at 14,472.9.

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) also rose a day ahead of its annual general meeting amid speculation the company may have new announcements about a potential tie-up with Reliance Communications Ltd. However, the outlook for broader shares remains weak amidst worries foreign institutional investors (FII) will reduce their purchases due to the weakening rupee and a potential end to the US Federal Reserve’s monetary stimulus. “FII selling is worrisome only for short term, but factors like Fed tapering and rupee appreciation are putting more focus on it,"" said Paras Adenwala, managing director and principal portfolio manager at Capital Portfolio Advisors. The Reserve Bank of India needs to be less hawkish as well if shares have to continue their upward trajectory, Adenwala added. The benchmark BSE index, Sensex, rose 0.11%, or 22.44 points, to 19,568.22. The index lost 3.3% over the previous three sessions to close at its lowest in nearly a month on Tuesday. The broader NSE index, the Nifty, rose 0.07%, or 4.40 points, to 5,923.85. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries rose 1.91% after Meda AB said it was not involved in discussions with a potential buyer, contradicting reports that the two companies were in talks. Sun shares had fallen recently on media reports it was in talks to buy Meda for $5 billion to $6 billion. Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) rose 0.73% after it won an infrastructure contract worth nearly $300 million from Saudi Aramco as India’s biggest construction and engineering firm chases overseas projects to offset a slowdown at home. RIL, which operates in the telecoms sector via unit Reliance Jio Infocomm, gained on speculation of a new tie-up with Reliance Communications. Both companies had announced in April a fibre optic network sharing deal. RIL rose 2.56%, while Reliance Communications rose 5.29%. Other companies controlled by billionaire Anil Ambani, who controls Reliance Communications, also gained.

The company raised about $165 million last month in the country’s biggest listing so far this year. However, among stocks that fell, Cadila Healthcare Ltd dropped 4.42% after the drug maker announced regulatory approval for a diabetes drug, disappointing investors who had expected a bigger announcement. Indian cement makers Ambuja Cements Ltd, ACC Ltd and UltraTech Cement Ltd fell as the early arrival of monsoon rains is seen likely to hurt construction activity in the coming months.

Raghu ********* RIL-RNRL case hearing likely to end today Mumbai: Arguments in the three-year-old court battle between Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) will finally wind down on Friday, 30 January. A two-judge bench in the Bombay high court that has been hearing the competing claims over the sale of natural gas from RIL’s Krishna-Godavari basin might also pass an interim order the same day. Currently, Mukesh Ambani-led RIL faces a stay on sale of natural gas from the KG-basin, and has asked for it to be vacated. RNRL is led by Mukesh Ambani’s estranged brother Anil Ambani. Protesting lifting of the stay, RNRL counsel Mukul Rohatgi on Thursday said RIL couldn’t ask the court to intervene since it had voluntarily agreed to give gas at $2.34 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) as part of a family agreement in 2005, when the Reliance group was divided between the two brothers. “If you (RIL) make a bad bargain, you stick to it. You can’t go to court to remedy losses from a bargain that was settled five years ago but has now turned unremunerative,"" he argued. RNRL is claiming its right over 28 million metric standard cubic metres of gas a day at a discounted price of $2.34 per mBtu, which is 45% less than the $4.20 per mBtu that NTPC Ltd agreed to pay RIL. The price was not yet decided as the matter is subjudice. An interim order, irrespective of which way it goes, will be significant for both firms. RIL is expected to start pumping gas from 15 February, according to an affidavit it filed earlier this month with the court, and needs the time to finalize deals with buyers. Gas prices in the international spot market have risen fourfold since the lawsuit began and are at $6-7 mBtu now. —Bhuma Shrivastava ********* Vanguard files petition against GHCL Mumbai: London-based textiles supplier Vanguard Textiles Ltd has filed a petition in the Gujarat high court against GHCL, seeking dues of Rs1.12 crore that it claims is owed to it by a subsidiary of the Indian company.

Vanugard is now seeking dues up to 20 January, and claims that Roseby’s owes it money against at least three of eight invoices. Vanguard has also asked the court to stop GHCLfrom conducting any business because doing so would enable it to “fritter away its assets and incur further losses to the detriment of the creditors including Roseby’s"". The petition is yet to come up for hearing. GHCL director (finance), Raman Chopra, dismissed the claim, saying Vanguard “does not have any case here"". The petition has no legal grounds, he cited lawyers as saying. Roseby’s went under ‘administration’ on 20 September, a process under UK law where a firm facing liquidation is overseen by an outside firm. GHCL had appointed global auditing firm KPMG International to handle the process. —Baiju Kalesh ********* Asian Paints’ founders pledge 15% stake Mumbai: India’s largest paint maker Asian Paints (India) Ltd dropped to the lowest in almost two years after saying that its founders had pledged a 15% stake and Citigroup Inc. cut the stock-price target.
