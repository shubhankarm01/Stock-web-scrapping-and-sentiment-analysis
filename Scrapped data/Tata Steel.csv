Updated: 08 Jul 2022,ICICI Securities sees good upside for Tata Steel in 3 months: Should you buy?,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/icici-securities-sees-good-upside-for-tata-steel-in-3-months-should-you-buy-11657285025295.html,"Shares of Tata Steel have witnessed a heavy sell-off in 2022 as in year-to-date time, Tata Steel share price has fallen from around ₹1142 to ₹885 apiece levels, logging around 22 per cent dip in this time frame.

ICICI Securities, a brokerage, has issued a buy call today for the stock with a target price of Rs. 1045, a buying range of Rs. 875-895, and a stop loss of Rs. 799. According to the brokerage, the stock's upside will be achieved within 3 months of the target frame. As per ICICI Securities, “the Nifty has remained volatile since the beginning of the May series along with broader markets. From the metal space, Tata Steel witnessed a significant correction on the back of a sharp decline in metal prices amid fear of global recession. However, after the correction of almost 45% from the top we feel currently it is in a pullback mode as it reverted from its Put base. We believe the recent momentum seen in the stock will be followed by fresh longs in coming sessions."" “Leveraged positions in the stock have declined noticeably till the current series as stock prices remained in a declining trend. However, since the early July series, the stock has been witnessing long accumulation where OI has risen marginally. The stock has been able to trade above its resistance level of ₹900, suggesting further upsides. The stock has been witnessing accumulation near the support level of ₹840-850. With continued Put writing in 800 and 860 strikes, we expect downside risk to be limited. On the other hand, Call OI of 860 and 880 strike is already witnessing closure of positions suggesting positive bias in the stock. These positions are expected to aid it in breaking the option range on the higher side,"" the brokerage has said in a note. “The stock has seen one of the notable delivery based action around ₹900 in the last couple of weeks. Since then, it has been crawling northwards with early signs of the stock making a base at the support area. The stock is trading near its long term mean-2*sigma levels. Currently, this level is placed near ₹810. We believe sustainability at current levels itself should provide momentum in the stock towards our target levels of ₹1045,"" said the research analysts of ICICI Securities. “In November 2020-August 2021, the stock had witnessed an impulsive up move towards ₹1500. Since then, it has largely seen time and price based correction. This recent decline towards ₹800-850 has given another opportunity to go long on the stock,"" said the brokerage. Tata Steel is a company with a high dividend yield and has shown a positive profit increase of over 76 per cent CAGR over the past five years. With a book value per share of Rs. 958.50 for Tata Steel, the stock is now selling at a low price to book value (P/B) of 0.92 times its book value.

Stocks in Asia closed higher on easing recession woes fears, while US stock-index futures and European equities fell as a pall of gloom descended on global markets after former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot to death.  Markets ended higher for the third day in a row as inflationary concerns eased amid weak oil prices. The Sensex gained  303.38 points or 0.56% at 54,481.84, while the Nifty rose 0.54% to 16,220.60.  While most Nifty sectoral indices ended in the green, metals and realty were the laggards. Larsen and Toubro, Power Grid Corporation, and NTPC were among the top gainers., Tata Steel, and Maruti Suzuki lagged. Meanwhile, a pall of gloom descended on global markets as former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot to death. The news was a further blow to investors already reeling under the worst economic challenges since the 2008 financial crisis.   Chairman N Chandrasekaran said the firm aims to have an electricity generation capacity of 30 GW during the same period with more than half coming from clean energy sources.   IDBI Mutual Fund, Canara Robeco Mutual Fund, and Axis Mutual fund have announced a revision in the risk-o-meter for some of their schemes. In all the cases, the assessed risk level of the schemes has gone down from what it was earlier. This was done to reflect the change in the risk levels of these schemes subsequent to an evaluation.   The demand conditions for Kalyan Jewellers India Ltd seem to be encouraging. So far, there has been no considerable impact on demand post the government’s recent move to raise import duty on gold, said Ramesh Kalyanaraman, executive director, Kalyan Jewellers. Even so, how demand pans out in the coming days would be a crucial factor to watch out for in the short-run. The company remains one of the key beneficiaries of the shift in demand from the unorganized to the organized segment.   We expect life insurers to report robust NBP/APE growth YoY with the base effect playing out. The focus on higher-margin products (non-par, protection and annuity products) and subsequent improvement in the product mix are likely to improve the margins for life insurers. With rising rates, we could witness near-term headwinds, as an increase in discount rates could potentially impact the Embedded Value (EV) of life insurers. Broking revenues are likely to take a hit owing to weak cash segment volumes. However, F&O volumes have held up well. A sharp drop in capital market activity (IPO market) will dent issuer and advisory services revenues. While distribution income is likely to improve YoY, it will witness moderation QoQ (seasonal phenomena). New customer sourcing is likely to slow down with a focus on acquiring better quality customers. Positive result plays: ICICI Bank, SBI, SBI Cards, AU Small Finance Bank, Bajaj Finance   The government on Friday clarified that the export duty on air turbine fuel introduced last week will not apply if it is supplied as fuel to “foreign going aircraft"". The clarification comes amid reports that one of the three oil marketing companies (OMCs) started charging 11% basic excise duty on ATF from domestic airlines for international flights. It caused unrest among airlines as they feared that will make international operations expensive and put them at a disadvantage viz a viz foreign airlines, which are exempt from the duty.   European shares were muted on Friday, weighed down by miners as copper prices retreated on concerns over latest Covid-19 curbs and infection flare-ups in China, while investors also maintained a cautious stance ahead of monthly U.S. jobs data. The continent-wide STOXX 600 index was down 0.1%, after climbing 3.6% in the previous two sessions.   Consumer demand remained mixed during 1Q23 showing twin impacts of 1) price hikes and inflation in staples and 2) positive impact of fading Covid waves, low base and pent up demand across QSR, Apparel and retail segments. We expect staple margins to show pressure, however expect margin expansion post 2Q due to price hikes being absorbed and likely softening of commodity prices. QSR, Retail and discretionary segments are expected to report strong revenue growth of 33.5% and outlook remains good over next 2-3 years. We expect EBITDA margins to weaken QoQ by 15bp. Adj PAT is expected to grow by 34.5% YoY. We expect a wide range of volume growth from mid-single digit decline to low double digit growth across companies under our coverage universe barring Jewellery/QSRs segments. We remain structurally positive on Westlife, Britannia, HUL, D’Mart, Titan, APNT and Moldtek given sustainable competitive advantage and business moats. Valuations have corrected from peak; however, they are still higher than last 10-year average. We rate D’Mart, Dabur & Westlife as top picks. ITC is a tactical pick given solid performance and favorable valuations, any potential excise duty changes remains a key risk for the stock. TOP PICKS -Dabur: We expect Inflationary pressures to keep margins volatile in the near term even as long term story remains intact led by 1) sustained increase in direct rural reach from 55000 villages to 88000 villages 2) GTM initiatives in ecommerce and modern trade and 3) sustained innovation across portfolio including regional customization. We estimate EPS growth of 13.1% and 19.7% in FY23 & FY24 respectively. We estimate 16% EPS CAGR over FY23-24 and assign DCF based target price of ₹603. Retain Accumulate. -Westlife Development: Accelerated store expansion from 20-25 stores to 40-50 stores/year (200 stores over 3-4 years). WDL is piloting fried chicken in western markets to gauge the response, as it looks set to launch Gourmet Burgers in south India. With no major capex within existing stores, chicken sales can offer Rs500mn incremental revenues with high gross margins of 65-70% which will be margin accretive. Despite opening up of economy, convenience channel contribution continues to remain strong. We expect AUV to increase led by convenience channel sales, new product innovations like Gourmet Burgers, Fried chicken and sustained scale up of McCafe which shall enable profitable growth in the coming years. We estimate Sales CAGR of 25.0% over FY22-24 with an EPS of Rs6.4/ Rs9.2 in FY23/24. We assign DCF based target price of Rs653. (Rs645 earlier). ‘BUY’ for long term gains. -Avenue Supermart: D’Mart remains a structural pick given 1) strong entry barriers in brick and mortar modern trade 2) Long growth path as it has scope to increase stores by 3.5x in catchments where it has entered 3) Strong growth prospects, as it is yet to fully sweat 80 stores opened during Covid 3) Expected margin expansion, as general merchandise and apparel category has suffered during Covid and 5) Rising city coverage and strong traction in D’Mart Ready. With Bill cuts/store/day 33% lower than FY20 and gains from inflationary environment, we estimate 42% PAT CAGR over FY22-24. Retain ‘BUY’ -Over the past 2 weeks, HUVR/BRIT have rallied sharply by 20%/13% led by tailwinds in commodity prices. Key input materials such as crude oil & palm oil have corrected by 20.8%/55.0% from peak levels. Crude oil prices have fallen due to recession fears in western markets, while Palm oil prices have fallen due to increased exports from Indonesia & Malaysia. We place our BUY rating on the stocks ‘UNDER REVIEW’ given change in business environment and would revise our rating/ Target Price post 1Q23 earnings.   The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 154.2 points last month versus a revised 157.9 for May.   Celsius Network, the crypto lender that froze assets last month, used customer funds to manipulate the price of its proprietary token and lost hundreds of millions of dollars by failing to hedge risk, a former money manager for the company said in a lawsuit.   Asian markets rose Friday on easing recession fears with optimism boosted by hopes that Joe Biden will remove some Trump-era tariffs from Chinese goods. The safe-haven yen also picked up following news of Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe being shot during a campaign rally. He is still fighting for his life. Tokyo - Nikkei 225 rose 0.1 percent at 26,517.19, Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index rose 0.2 percent at 21,680.96 Shanghai - Composite fell 0.4 percent at 3,356.08     Multiplexes are expected to outperform in the first quarter of FY23 as compared to all earlier quarters in the post-pandemic era led by the successful run of films like RRR, KGF: Chapter 2 and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2. Chains like PVR and INOX Leisure Ltd are likely to post revenues of Rs. 9.25 billion and Rs. 5.5 billion respectively, according to estimates by brokerages like Edelweiss and Elara.

(PTI)   -Aggregate Revenue/EBIDTA expected to decline by ~1%/3% QoQ. -Aggregate EBITDA margins (excl JLR) expected to largely remain flat QoQ, with RM cost pressures partly offset by price hikes and cost controls. In 1QFY23 two-wheeler (2W) segment topped charts with ~8% QoQ growth, supported by marriage season demand (especially in entry-level segment Hero’s volume grew 17% QoQ), while Passenger vehicle (PV) segment remained largely muted (2% decline). PV retail enquiries and bookings are currently healthy. With semiconductor supply now normalizing, PV OEMs are serving their already healthy order book and mitigating longer waiting periods. Commercial vehicle (CV) segment witnessed ~9% decline QoQ, led by seasonality factor. However, on-ground situation is much better as fleet utilization levels are healthy, led by increased economic and infrastructural activities. Tractor segment volumes witnessed an uptick with onset of monsoon season. For our OEM coverage universe, we expect aggregate revenue decline of ~1% QoQ. Gross margins to contract by ~60bps for most OEMs, due to lag impact of higher commodity prices in 4QFY22. From 2QFY23 onwards, we expect margin expansion for auto OEMs driven by softening of commodity prices, price hikes and upcoming festive season. We remain structurally positive on CV play and expect Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors to benefit from CV recovery. Tata Motors will further benefit from strong PV volumes supported by new models, EV and recovery at JLR. Our top picks are Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors.     The CBI has registered a fresh case against former National Stock Exchange (NSE) chiefs Chitra Ramkrishna, Ravi Narain and ex-Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Pandey, on the directions of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), for allegedly tapping phones of NSE employees between 2009 and 2017.

Gold has steadied after testing 9-month low as US dollar index paused after lack of surprise form FOMC minutes and amid positioning for US non-farm payrolls data which is expected to show slower jobs growth. However, weighing on price is monetary tightening stance of Fed and other central banks and weaker investor interest as is evident from ETF outflows. Gold has fallen sharply and may see some recovery however a sharp rise is unlikely unless US dollar corrects.   Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra rose 5.4% in early trade on Friday on NSE taking the stock to a new 52-week high of Rs1194.90 apiece. This comes on the back of the company’s announcement of executing an agreement with British International Investment, UK’s development finance institution, to invest up to Rs1,925 crore or $250 million each into a new wholly owned EV subsidiary of M&M. “Net value accretion to M&M shareholders will depend on its ability to leverage the electrification trend and expand its market share in the SUV segment. Currently, we are not valuing the EV business separately as it doesn’t have any material presence in the electric PV segment,"" said Motilal Oswal in a report.   Nifty's 16000-16045 odd level should act as the demand zone and cushion any minor blips. The 16200 sub-level is likely to be seen as the immediate resistance, breaching which the next potential hurdle could be seen around the 16325-16400 zone. Going forward, our market is likely to remain upbeat in the near term, wherein any minor dip could be seen as an opportunity for the bulls to add long positions. From here on, we may expect gradual moves in key indices, but individual pockets are now likely to outshine. Hence, it’s advisable to keep focusing on such potential movers, which are likely to provide better trading opportunities. Also, we would like to reiterate not being complacent with the gains and staying abreast with daily developments across the globe.   The move comes after the central bank had returned a large number of payment aggregator licence applications earlier this year, that it had received from many firms. The RBI is now expected to release a complete list of the players who have been approved to operate as payment aggregators in the country shortly, the report added.   We expect companies in our retail coverage universe to deliver a strong show in Q1FY23 (the only non-disrupted quarter in the last two years). As per our channel checks, fashion retailers, on a per store basis, have registered a recovery rate in the range of 110%+ of pre-Covid levels. The optimism was driven by improved consumer sentiments, wardrobe refresh and increased spend on discretionary purchases as consumer wallet share on non-essentials had remained subdued in the last two years. Also, fashion lifestyle retailers had built up healthy inventory for spring summer season in Q4FY22 after curtailing purchases for nearly two years (on an average, absolute inventory increased 1.5x YoY). On a favourable base of Q1FY22, we expect revenues to more than double (2.4x YoY) for our companies in our coverage universe (impressive three-year CAGR: 17%). In a bid to negate inflationary pressure, apparel retailers have taken price hikes in the range of 15-20%. Expect EBITDA margins to improve 80 bps QoQ (down 70 bps vs. Q1FY20 levels) to 12.3% in Q1FY23E. During the quarter, retailers continued calibrated expansion of their store network with opening of 10 D-Mart stores, 19 Tanishq stores, 56 Titan EyeCare stores, eight Zudio stores, three Westside stores and 11 V-Mart stores (including four Unlimited stores). Companies have restructured their existing store networks and aggressively enhanced footprint on a pan-India basis with emphasis on penetrating deeper in Tier III-V cities to capture potential demand pockets.   Positivity rate at 4.95%, recovery rate is 98.52% & mortality rate is 1.21%   Global gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) registered 28 tonnes or $1.7 billion of outflows in June, which the second straight month of selloff, according to a report by the World Gold Council. In India, minor net inflows continued in June, primarily driven by market volatility and a depreciating rupee attracting investment into Indian gold ETFs   Multiple Indian funds have urgently petitioned the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to ease the overseas investment cap for Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) to avoid missing out on deals but are facing a steep battle amid the sharp fall in the rupee in recent months, three people aware of the development said. Overseas investments by Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) cumulatively hit the $1.5 billion threshold just last week, one of the people cited above said. Sebi allows 25% of an AIF’s investible corpus to be invested overseas at an individual level with a $1.5 billion cap at an aggregate level for all AIFs.   Days after IndiGo suffered major flight delays due to cabin crew unavailability, the airline reinstated pilot salaries by 8% that will be effective from 1 August. “On 31st March, we were able to reinstate 8% effective 1st April, 2022 and had committed to you that an additional reinstatement of 6.5% would be implemented from 1st November 2022 based on the environment,"" read an internal letter sent to the pilots       Gold firmed on Friday as the dollar came slightly off two-decade highs, but bullion was set to post its biggest weekly drop in more than a month as the elevated greenback hit demand. Spot gold firmed 0.3% to $1,744.07 per ounce by 0106 GMT. U.S. gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,742.50. The dollar edged down from 20-year highs, taking some weight off greenback-priced gold.

The pandemic-era overseas borrowing boom by Indian companies has started to slow as interest rates rise, the currency weakens, and the appetite for emerging market bonds diminishes. Measures announced by the Reserve Bank of India easing overseas borrowings by companies, including doubling the annual limit under the automatic route to $1.5 billion and raising the all-in cost cap for foreign debt, though welcome, will do little to spur the market in the near term, experts said.

Analysts at JPMorgan do not see further declines in the domestic steel market.  ""Overall Tata Steel remains committed to ~$1 bn net debt reduction, and we see upside risk to this number if underlying earnings hold up at current levels. With the combination of working capital release and elevated underlying earnings, Tata Steel should deliver another year of material net debt reduction,"" the note stated.  The global brokerage has overweight tag on the Indian metal stock. Its June 2023 target price is ₹1,400 per share, implying a potential upside of more than 58% from the current stock level. While markets are likely to fear an immediate recession, JPMorgan believe the steel market is also facing a series of one-off issues (export tax, China demand decline on COVID-19, rains) that should ease. “Tata Steel's Europe footprint has materially declined, and India should continue to increase. TATA’s KPO expansion of 5MT, large captive iron ore mining ramp-up and new brownfield expansion pipeline yield strong volume visibility with an improving balance sheet,"" it added. Though, key downside risks to its rating and price target include a sharp decline in steel spreads and a sharp decline in steel demand in India, the brokerage said. “While TATA has attractive growth optionality across multiple sites in India (NINL, KPO, Meramandali), we believe the key constraint for TATA (and the large Indian Resource companies) is NOT capital, but how to deploy it aggressively on the ground. Large projects remain difficult to execute on time given labor mobilization and contractor issues. TATA’s 5MT KPO should be commissioned in 2HFY24, and post that we would expect TATA to start work on the next expansion,"" JPMorgan's note stated. Tata Steel, part of Tata Group, is one of the leading steel manufacturing companies of India. The company posted a 47% jump in its consolidated net profit at ₹9,756 crore for the quarter ended March 2022. Its revenue from operations, meanwhile, rose 38% to ₹69,323 crore. For Europe business, revenues increased by 54% over last year to £8,876 million and EBITDA stood at £1,199 million.

An Indian monetary policy dove signaled it’s probably time to abandon the aggressive pace of increases in borrowing costs, saying the inflation-adjusted real interest-rate is approaching neutral terrain -- a level where it can help check inflation without stifling economic growth. Sticking to larger hikes instead carries the risk of crimping an already weak demand without materially softening inflation, Ashima Goyal, one of the six members of the Monetary Policy Committee, warned in an email interview, adding that she isn’t speaking on behalf of the full MPC. “Indian real interest rates are not far from neutral,"" she said, referring to benchmark rate that’s risen to 4.9%, amid inflation easing to 7% in May from 7.8% in the previous month   Asian shares were mostly higher Tuesday after a wobbly day on Wall Street as markets cooled off following a rare winning week.

Spot gold was last up 0.1% at $1,824.65 per ounce by 0056 GMT. U.S. gold futures were flat at $1,824.70.

Oil rose for a third session as threats to global output risked tightening the market further before OPEC+ meets this week to discuss supply. West Texas Intermediate futures climbed above $110 a barrel after adding about 5% over the past two sessions. Libya is facing more disruptions to its exports due to a worsening political crisis, while anti-government protests in Ecuador threaten to shut down production in the former OPEC member. Any halt to supply could reverberate through the global oil market, which has been squeezed by an economic rebound and upended trade flows from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. Some OPEC+ members have struggled to meet their production targets this year, exacerbating the tightness.   Asian shares edge down in early trade on Tuesday with investors taking their cue from a volatile Wall Street session overnight, while oil prices climbed following last week's rout. Oil continued to rise with investors still weighing worries over an economic slowdown against concern over lost Russian supply amid sanctions related to the conflict in Ukraine.

US stocks ended a volatile trading session slightly lower on Monday after posting sharp gains the week before, while oil prices and Treasury yields rose. Oil climbed following last week's rout, as the Group of Seven nations promised to tighten the squeeze on Russia's finances with new sanctions that include a plan to cap the price of Russian oil. Investors have been hoping oil's slide from three-month peaks hit earlier in June could ease overall inflation concerns and allow the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten policy less aggressively than initially feared. Stocks moved between gains and losses during the session on Wall Street, with big growth shares leading the way down. The S&P 500 earlier this month confirmed it is in a bear market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 62.42 points, or 0.2%, to 31,438.26, the S&P 500 lost 11.63 points, or 0.30%, to 3,900.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 83.07 points, or 0.72%, to 11,524.55. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.52% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.31%. A further easing of COVID-19 restrictions in China helped to support global indexes. The 10-year note rose 7 basis points to 3.194% and the two-year's yield, which can herald rate expectations, gained 6.9 basis points to 3.126%. Brent crude futures settled up $1.97, or 1.7%, at $115.09 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude closed up $1.95, or 1.8%, at $109.57.  "

Inherent strength of branch network and established brands provide strength to incumbents. However, intense competition (especially in H2FY22) has led to lower yields and declining RoEs. The change in profitability outlook has led to lower valuation multiples.

Even the strong bullish candle on the daily chart construes to be an encouraging sign for the bulls, as the Nifty tested the historical support zone of the 15700. On the front of the level, the unfilled gap of 15380-15420 is expected to cushion any minor correction, while the 15180-15200 zone withholds the sacrosanct zone for the index. On the contrary, the 15750 zone is likely to act as a stiff resistance, followed by the sturdy wall of the unfilled gap starting from the 15900 odd level. Hence, looking at the recent developments, the market is expected to hover within the mentioned zone until any decisive breakthrough does not take place. Meanwhile, global markets also need to be on a close radar as they might act as catalysts with their developments. We advocate having a pragmatic approach in the market by focusing more on the beaten-up frontline counters for the time being.

The Federal Reserve will deliver another 75-basis-point interest rate hike in July, followed by a half-percentage-point rise in September, and won't scale back to quarter-percentage-point moves until November at the earliest, according to economists polled by Reuters. Last week the Fed hiked the federal funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, its largest rate increase since 1994, after official data just a few days earlier showed inflation unexpectedly rose despite expectations it had peaked. The latest poll results, released on Wednesday before Fed Chair Jerome Powell was due to appear before the Senate Banking Committee as part of his twice-yearly monetary policy testimony to Congress, show momentum is still behind the U.S. central bank doing more, not less, despite rising recession concerns and a steep sell-off in financial markets. Bond yields are up sharply and major Wall Street equity indexes are already trading in a bear market, defined as 20% down from their peak.

That would take the fed funds rate to a range of 2.25%-2.50%, roughly the neutral level where the Fed estimates the economy is neither stimulated nor restricted.   Stocks finished broadly higher on Wall Street Tuesday, clawing back some of the ground they lost in their worst weekly drop since the beginning of the pandemic.

Last week, the Fed hiked its key short-term interest rate by the most since 1994, the central bank’s latest effort to tame the worst inflation in 40 years. The S&P 500 rose 2.4%, recouping about 40% of its losses last week. More than 85% of the stocks in the benchmark index gained ground.

India has instead defended its purchase of Russian goods as a bid to diversify supplies and argues that a sudden halt would boost prices and hurt consumers. Tata Steel was the only major steelmaker to announce it would stop doing business with Russia. Other Indian steelmakers have been importing bulk quantities of coal from Russia, trade data reviewed by Reuters showed. The PCI coal was imported in a vessel named Panamax Ostria, the trade sources said. The government source confirmed Tata Steel had imported 75,000 tonnes of coal from Russia in May, but did not give more details. Details on Tata Steel's Russian coal imports have not been previously reported. Purchases of Russian coal by Indian buyers including steelmakers have spiked in recent weeks despite Western sanctions on Moscow, as traders offer discounts of up to 30%, Reuters reported on Saturday. Cheap coal supplies are especially crucial to Indian steelmakers now, as they are reeling from export duties imposed by the Indian government last month to curb local inflation. The Nifty metals index has fallen over 20% since the decision to levy export taxes on May 21, with Tata Steel falling about 26%, JSW Steel declining 12% and Jindal Steel and Power's shares losing 21% of their value since the announcement.

The rupee strengthened 12 paise to 77.93 against the US dollar in opening trade on Monday as easing crude oil prices supported the local unit. However, unabated foreign fund outflows, a lacklustre trend in domestic equities and a strong dollar overseas capped gains, forex dealers said. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened strong at 77.98 against the US dollar, then inched higher to quote 77.93, registering a rise of 12 paise over the last close. In the previous session, the rupee advanced 5 paise to settle at 78.05 against the US dollar.   Nifty The Nifty declined for the sixth consecutive session on Friday and ended last week with a loss of around 5.5%. According to options data, aggressive Call writing was seen across multiple strikes, especially 15500 Call strike that holds substantial OI, which should act as resistance. Hence, any rise around 15500 levels should be used to create short positions. Bank Nifty On Friday, the Bank Nifty relatively outperformed the Nifty and closed with a gain of 0.38%. The Bank Nifty 32500 Put strike holds sizeable OI, which should act as immediate support for the day while on the higher side 33000 Call strike should act as an immediate resistance and limit upsides.   Vedanta has invited Expressions of Interest (EoI) for its Tuticorin-based smelter, Sterlite Copper, which has been shut since mid-2018, following a Tamil Nadu government order. The last day to submit EoIs is 4 July. Plant units, including oxygen generation facility as well as residential homes, are also part of the sale offer. The plant has faced closures over alleged violation of environmental norms. Sterlite Copper accounted for 40% of India's copper output, before it was forced to close.   The Nifty is exactly placed at the previous breakout point of May 2021 which is around 15400 – 15300. In addition, the ‘RSI-Smoothened’ oscillator on the daily chart is showing a ‘Positive Divergence’ i.e. lower lows in recent prices and higher lows in the oscillator. This condition generally happens at the fag end of any downtrend. Hence, looking at the charts, we are clearly in two minds at this juncture. In our sense, although we did not manage to catch the recent down move, it’s better not to get carried away in the challenging times. As far as supports are concerned, 15200 – 15000 are to be seen as immediate support and breach of the same, would certainly create some panic kind of situation in our markets. Markets would regain strength only after surpassing the key levels of 15700 – 15800 on a closing basis. Till then it's not advisable to carry aggressive longs overnight. Traders are advised to take one step at a time in the forthcoming week and should ideally look to lighten up positions during the day only. Since we are mirroring the global trends, markets can surprise us anytime in either direction. There is a famous saying in the market that one should avoid catching a falling knife (market). This holds true for momentum traders but with a slightly broader perspective, we are of the strong belief that no one should certainly start accumulating quality propositions in a staggered manner.   The finance ministry is working to expand and relaunch the Banks Board Bureau (BBB) by bringing in more representatives from the insurance sector, two people aware of the matter said.

Air India Ltd. is considering ordering as many as 300 narrowbody jets, according to people familiar with the matter, in what could be one of the largest orders in commercial aviation history as the formerly state-run airline looks to overhaul its fleet under new ownership. The carrier may order Airbus SE’s A320neo family jets or Boeing Co.’s 737 Max models, or a mix of both, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are confidential. A deal for 300 737 Max-10 jets could be worth $40.5 billion at sticker prices, although discounts are common in such large purchases. Winning a narrowbody order in India would be a coup for Boeing, as rival Airbus dominates the skies in the country, the world’s fastest-growing aviation market before the Covid pandemic. IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., is the world’s largest customer for the European manufacturer’s best-selling narrowbodies, ordering more than 700, and others including Vistara, Go Airlines India Ltd. and AirAsia India Ltd. fly planes from the same family.

MSCI Inc.’s gauge of Asia-Pacific shares hit the lowest since June 2020 amid drops in Japan and Hong Kong and mixed performance in China, where banks kept their main lending rates unchanged. S&P 500 contracts turned lower, while those for the Nadsaq 100 reversed a gain of more than 1%. Markets are set to remain on edge amid elevated price pressures and concern that monetary tightening in a range of nations portends more losses. In the latest Fed commentary, Governor Christopher Waller said he would support another 75-basis-point rate increase at the central bank’s July meeting should economic data come in as he expects. S&P 500 futures fell 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.1%. Euro Stoxx 50 futures fell 0.4% Japan’s Topix index fell 1.1%, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.6%, South Korea’s Kospi fell 2.3%, Hang Seng Index fell 0.4%, and Shanghai Composite was little changed. On Friday, Wall Street stocks ended a rocky week mostly higher but lower for the week amid worsening fears of recession as the US central bank takes aggressive action against inflation. The broad-based S&P 500, which entered a bear market week, added 0.2% to finish at 3,674.84, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.4% to 10,798.35.

Indices remained volatile for most part of the day as investors were worried that aggressive policy tightening by central banks could stifle global economic growth. However, in the noon trade, the indices made smart recovery. European equities slipped ahead of a European Central Bank decision that will put the region’s monetary policy on a path of tightening and help close the gap with global peers. Oil prices hovered near three-month highs on Thursday after parts of Shanghai imposed new Covid-19 lockdown measures.

Global wealth rose 10.6% last year to reach a record high of $530 trillion in 2021 and is set to continue rising in all regions despite inflationary pressures and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Strong equity markets and a surge in demand for real assets such as property, wine and art drove the increase, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group. About $80 trillion of new wealth is likely to be created over the next five years. “Wealth development is resoundingly resilient, and even against the backdrop of geopolitical turmoil the growth rate will remain positive,"" said Anna Zakrzewski, global leader of BCG’s wealth management arm.   China’s trade growth rebounded in May after anti-virus restrictions that shut down Shanghai and other industrial centers began to ease.   The rupee slipped 13 paise to hit its intra-day record low of 77.81 against the US dollar on Thursday, weighed down by elevated crude oil prices and persistent foreign capital outflows. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 77.74 against the American dollar, then fell further and touched its intra-day record low of 77.81, registering a fall of 13 paise from the last close. On Wednesday, the rupee recovered from its record low to close 10 paise higher at 77.68 against the American currency. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday raised the key interest rate by 50 basis points, the second increase in five weeks, to rein in the rise in prices that it saw continuing to hurt consumers in the near term.   Repo rate hiked further, MPC focused on containing inflation: MPC unanimously voted to further hike policy repo rate by 50bps to 4.9%. It remains focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure inflation is contained within the target while supporting growth. There is a change in the commentary from ‘withdrawal of ultraaccommodative’ stance to ‘withdrawal of accommodative’ and that upside risks to inflation persists, and appear more hawkish. The move reflects reversal of rate action in 2020 and also points towards further rate hikes during the year and get closer towards the pre-pandemic repo rate. No CRR hike: Post CRR hike of 50bps in May (that would have sucked systemic liquidity to the extent of Rs870bn), systemic liquidity has moderated. There was no further hike in CRR. While normalising the pandemic related extraordinary liquidity accommodation, RBI will ensure adequate liquidity to meet the productive requirements. Will trigger further increase in deposit and lending rates: Recently, post repo rate hike in May, MCLRs were hiked by 10-30bps by leading banks. Banks have also raised deposit rates across maturity buckets with peak retail TD rates being at 5.75%. Also, wholesale peak TD rates are in the range of 5.25-5.75% for leading private banks. Now with another 50bps repo rate hike, rates will be further revised upwards.   We believe cloud opportunities will be beneficial for Indian IT service providers given – 1) 51% of IT spending in the areas of application software, infrastructure software, business process services and system infrastructure will shift to public cloud by CY25 (vs 41% in CY22), according to Gartner; 2) worldwide spending on public cloud services to increase from US$411bn in CY21 to US$495bn in CY22 with IaaS expected to grow the fastest (Gartner); and 3) cloud sustainability initiatives to start with leading cloud providers. Surge in cloud adoption could prove to be a growth lever for IT service providers on the back of cloud platforms created by them to help speed up cloud transformation journey of clients, thereby improving the utilisation of cloud capacity subscribed by clients, and thus, translating bookings into revenues for hyperscalers partners. With Indian IT players already building strong partnerships with hyperscalers, we believe pickup in spends on cloud transformation should make Indian IT a key beneficiary as well. Companies like TCS, INFY, HCLT and TECHM have developed strong organic cloud platforms and it is yielding good results. We believe among tier-2 players, MTCL, LTI and PSYS have strong collaborations and are expanding aggressively in cloud opportunities.   A consortium of Apollo Global Management Inc. and Reliance Industries Ltd. has made a binding offer for Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.’s international arm, people with knowledge of the matter said.   Shares of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) continued to decline with the stock hitting a new record low of ₹723 apiece on the BSE in Thursday's afternoon deals. The stock is now about 25% down from its IPO issue price of ₹949.   Our neutral stance on paint industry (and stocks) is intact - a function of our inability and unwillingness to subscribe to BAAP (buy at any price) as believed by some market participants. We actively cover most listed paint stocks. Ratings: ADD - Akzo Nobel; HOLD - Asian Paints, Indigo Paints, Kansai Nerolac; REDUCE - Berger Paints (based on valuation).   Witnessing positive momentum for the 15th straight month, equity mutual funds attracted a net sum of ₹18,529 crore in May amid heightened volatility in stock markets and consistent selling by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs).

Buyers on Wall Street were in retreat again after data showed US crude and gasoline stockpiles sank, just as the summer driving season begins and a leading OPEC member warned demand would surge further as China reopens. Adding to the gloom was the OECD's sharp downward revision of its global growth outlook and doubling of its inflation forecast. The glum mood was only slightly offset by ongoing optimism that Beijing's tech crackdown was close to an end.   We estimate 20-22% CAGR in CIF and Receivables over FY22-24. Despite modelling 25 bps MDR reduction (partial recoup through opex), we estimate RoA/RoE to be 5.5-6%/24-26% which was the pre-pandemic metric (adjusted for capital base). We believe that stock price represents overstretched concerns on a) MDR reduction and lack of flexibility to recoup it, b) structural pressure on cost-income/profitability from increased competitive intensity, c) impact on growth from rising scale of the new-age card cos. and BNPL. Being the only listed pure-play credit card issuer with significantly higher profitability than Banks and NBFCs (in good times as well as bad times), SBI Cards would continue to command a premium valuation. Reiterate BUY with 12m PT of Rs1260.   Outstanding credit cards in the system in April grew 20.7% year-on-year to 75.2 million, the highest in the past 25 months, according to Digital Payments tracker report from Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

State-owned CIL on Thursday said that it has floated its maiden tender to import 2.416 million tonnes of coal to ensure adequate supply of the fuel to power plants in the country. The development assumes significance in the wake of the government making all efforts to build up stock of coal to avoid the reoccurrence of power outages, which happened in April on account of shortage of the fossil fuel.

Most companies announced dividends following the Q4 results of the current financial year, but it is important to note that one should look at companies that are virtually debt-free and have a continuous record of paying dividends.

As a consequence, here are three Mahindra group companies that will pay dividends soon.   6 stocks to buy today — 9th June   In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin price today plunged below $31,000 level after rising above the mark in the previous session. The world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency plunged more than 3% and was trading at $30,173.

Back in February, when India was still in denial about its brewing inflation challenge, economists at Nomura Holdings Inc. summarized the choices before the monetary authority into three neat boxes. First, they said, there was a 15% probability that the central bank was right to ignore supply-side pressures. But their base case, to which they assigned a 50% likelihood, was that the Reserve Bank of India was wrong and it would have to pivot to containing price increases. They did consider a third possibility to which they gave a fairly significant 35% chance: that the RBI, although wrong about inflation, would simply go on to tolerate it.   Gold inched lower on Thursday, with prices restrained by rising Treasury yields ahead of key U.S. jobs and inflation data this week.

Asian stocks fell, U.S. bond yields rose and a soaring dollar pushed to a two-decade high against the yen on Thursday as investors worried about the outlook for more rate rises ahead of a key meeting of the European Central Bank later in the day. But before the meeting, at which the ECB is set to bring to an end its Asset Purchase Programme and signal rate hikes to combat rising inflation, moves in the Asian session were relatively muted as many investors kept to the sidelines.   Indian economy is projected to cross $5 trillion in 2026-27 and likely to become $20 trillion by 2040, Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said on Wednesday.   The top US securities regulator on Wednesday unveiled a planned overhaul of Wall Street retail stock trading rules, aiming to boost competition for handling orders by commission-free brokerages to ensure mom-and-pop investors get the best price for trades.

The Wall Street watchdog plans to scrutinize growth in recent years of the payment for order flow (PFOF) practice, which is banned in Canada, the UK and Australia.

The S&P 500 ended down more than 1% in the broad sell-off, snapping a two-day winning streak. Among its biggest drags, shares of Intel Corp slid 5.3% after Citi cut its estimates on the chipmaker for the second time in a week. Citi pointed to uncertainty about demand for personal computers and predicted the company could pre-announce weaker-than-expected earnings for the second quarter. Other chip shares also fell. Brent crude oil prices rose above $123 a barrel and hit a 13-week high, while the Dow Jones transportation average fell 3.8%, significantly underperforming the other main indexes on the day.

Stocks wavered in Asia on Thursday and bonds were again on the back foot, weighed down by the impact of high inflation. Equities were mixed in Japan and fell in Australia and South Korea. Hong Kong may offer a modicum of relief from an ongoing rally in Chinese tech shares that’s predicated on an easing regulatory crackdown and loosening Covid curbs. US futures fluctuated after Wall Street snapped a two-day rally on a climb in oil past $122 a barrel that stoked worries about rising costs and monetary tightening. Benchmark Treasury yields held above 3% and New Zealand’s 10-year yield touched the highest level in seven years. The dollar-yen pair is dominating foreign-exchange markets, with the weakness in Japan’s currency putting the 2002 high of 135.15 in play. Markets remain fixated on the risk of a downturn triggered by interest-rate hikes across much of the world to quell price pressures. The OECD added to the gloom with a warning that the global economy will pay a “hefty price"" for Russia’s war in Ukraine in the form of weaker growth, stronger inflation and potentially long-lasting damage to supply chains.

EBITDA stood strong at ₹7,597 Cr, up 30% YoY, flat QoQ, and in line with our estimate. The YoY growth was led by higher EBITDA from Aluminium India on the back of strong Aluminium prices. Flat EBITDA performance QoQ was led by the drop in Novelis' EBITDA mainly due to higher energy prices in Europe. Adjusted PAT stood strong at ₹3,851 Cr, up 100% YoY and 5% QoQ, but missed our estimate due to higher depreciation and interest expense. Deleveraging continued in the quarter with Net Debt at ₹39,096 Cr as of Mar’22 vs ₹43,733 Cr as of Dec’21, with Net-debt to EBITDA improving to 1.36x in Q4FY22 vs 1.62x in Q3FY22.

(Read more)   The Indian economy renewed its tryst with the recovery from the pandemic in 2021-22, albeit interrupted by a virulent second wave of infections and a relatively milder third wave, said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). High frequency indicators already point to some loss of momentum in the recovery that has been gaining traction from the second quarter of 2021-22. Furthermore, steadfast policy support put a floor underneath aggregate demand and economic activity. Thus, as per RBI, the experience of 2021-22 has yielded valuable lessons that will illuminate the path of the Indian economy in the year ahead. Headline inflation spiked on repetitive supply shocks during the year, though reversion to the target was also evident as shocks receded, RBI said on its Annual Report for 2021-22 released on Friday. The monetary policy remained accommodative and fostered congenial financial conditions for the recovery to take root, while being vigilant that inflation remains within the target going forward.     With aluminium and alumina prices coming off the peak, we revise our price assumptions downwards (alumina has corrected from the peak of $500/tn in Mar’22 to spot at $363/t) and cut our EBITDA estimates for FY23/24E.

TP implies an upside potential of 15% from the CMP.   Shares of Page Industries Ltd surged around 7% on the NSE in Friday's early trade.

It can't be a situation where the operation is successful and the patient is dead,"" Das said.

Following are the highlights from the report by Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, State Bank of India. * We are projecting GDP growth for FY22 at 8.5% and Q4 FY22 at 2.7%. We however believe the GDP projection for Q4 FY22 is clouded by significant uncertainties. For example, even an 1% downward revision in Q1 GDP estimates of FY22 from 20.3%, all other things remaining unchanged could push Q4 GDP growth to 3.8%. * We believe that downward adjustments in Q1,Q2,Q3 numbers could have a soothing impact on Q4 GDP numbers. Every ₹10,000 crore revision adds / subtracts 7 basis points from GDP growth. * We are skeptical that crude prices may not sustain at this high level for long. * The best thing that has emerged during pandemic is the coordinated policy response by both the Government and RBI in staving off the pandemic and now inflation. *In recent times, there has been a lot of debate regarding the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy, as evident in the recently released book by Dr. Viral Acharya, former DG of RBI. The friction in coordination between monetary and fiscal authorities has been a thorny issue globally in recent years particularly after the global financial crisis.

Tata Steel, Steel Authority of India and JSW Steel saw their shares slide. A global upswing in the prices of ferrous commodities had boosted the export earnings of these firms, but analysts see their overseas market prospects hit hard by the Centre’s action. The aim of discouraging exports was to keep domestic supplies up and prices down. The worry, however, is that little will be achieved on inflation, as specific causes of the phenomenon are hard to isolate at this late stage, even as it shows a lack of policy stability, distorts markets and disrupts the profit-maximizing plans of private businesses. It amounts to a market intervention of the kind top executives were familiar with in the era before liberalization when profits were subject to sudden shifts in operating conditions effected by policymakers. Inflation is for our central bank to tame. Sure, the Centre must also do its bit to help. But item-specific micromanagement is best avoided."

Updated: 23 May 2022,Steel stocks slump on export duty jolt,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/steel-stocks-slump-on-export-duty-jolt-11653285601079.html,"MUMBAI: Shares of major steel companies slumped on Monday following the government's decision to impose export duty on 11 iron and steel intermediates and cut import duty on three key raw materials for steel production. Tata Steel Ltd, JSW steel Ltd, SAIL, Jindal Steel and Power Ltd fell over 10%, with hitting 52-week lows in opening deals on Monday. The government on Saturday waived customs duty on the import of some raw materials, including coking coal and ferronickel, used by the steel industry, a move which will lower the cost for the domestic industry and reduce prices. Also, to increase domestic availability, the duty on exports of iron ore was hiked up to 50%, and a few steel intermediaries to 15%, according to a notification. This move is likely to divert more steel toward the domestic market and control the sharp upward spiral in steel prices, said analysts  Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities Ltd said, “The government’s decision to impose a 15% export duty on steel should lead to a significant correction in domestic steel prices (8-10%) given India’s dependence on exports"". This would impact the profitability and earnings of the Indian Steel manufacturers. This comes at a time when input cost of steel companies have risen sharply with rising coal and iron-ore prices, and could impact profitability and in some cases capital expenditure plans as well. Analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said, “We believe the measure would have produced the desired result if implemented a year ago when the steel prices were at a similar level but coal was about 20% lower and profitability was at a near peak. The industry would have the capacity to absorb the impact without sacrificing its capex plans, which is not possible now."" Domestic steel prices have risen sharply in the last two years and the Russia-Ukraine crisis meant hit unsustainable levels of ₹75,000-80,000 per tonne in early April.  As a result, there was some correction in prices. Hot-rolled coil prices were on a par with landed cost of imports at ₹69,000/tonne, or around $890, said Kamlesh Bagmar Deputy - Head of Research - Institutional Equities Prabhudas Lilladher. Export realisations for steel manufacturers stood at close to $900 a tonne. The 15% export duty, would translate to an additional cost of $135/tonne on volumes, said Bagmar. The global steel market was spooked following the Russia-Ukraine war, depressed market conditions in China and high inflation. Imposition of export duty by India could destabilise already weak demand in anticipation of lower supplies from Indian mills, added Bagmar."

Details here",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/tata-steel-sail-jsw-steel-shares-hit-lower-circuit-details-here-11653278111863.html,"Stock market today: Within few minutes of opening bell, three steel shares hit lower circuit today. These three shares are Tata Steel, Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and JSW Steel. Probably, the central government's announcement to calibrate custom duty on raw materials for iron and steel products by reducing import duty on some steel products and levying export duty on some ahs not gone down well on Dalal Street. Tata Steel share price today opened with a downside gap of near ₹73 per share and went on to hit lower circuit at ₹1053.20 apiece levels on BSE. SAIL share price nosedived in early morning deals and hit lower circuit placed at ₹74.70 levels on BSE. Similarly, JSW Steel share price opened under huge selling pressure and hit lower circuit at ₹567.80 per share levels. Calling export duty on steel as big negative for the sector, CLSA report says, “In a bid to curb inflation the Ministry of Finance announced export duties on most steel products, along with an excise duty cut for petrol and diesel. This is likely to divert more supply towards the domestic market. With prices now being guided by the export parity philosophy (instead of import parity) it could lead to a sharp correction in steel prices in India. Lower coking coal and iron ore prices and a tighter global balance are unlikely to offset this. Hence, we cut our estimates across our steel company coverage and downgrade all three stocks: Tata Steel, from BUY to Underperform, JSW from, Underperform to SELL, and JSPL, from BUY to Outperform."" However, CLSA report maintained that the decision augurs well for cement and consumer durables. Explaining the reason for sharp fall in steel stocks today, ICICI Security report says, ""The Indian government has imposed export duties on steel, steelmaking raw materials and intermediaries to preserve higher domestic supplies and control rising prices. Most of the exports of steel/stainless steel will attract 15% export duty now (from nil earlier). We see this as an extremely negative development for the steel sector and expect broad-based multiple de-rating. We downgrade steel/stainless equities under our coverage to either HOLD/REDUCE/SELL. We downgrade Tata Steel, JSPL, JSW Steel and SAIL to REDUCE."" ""The government announced it will calibrate custom duty on raw materials for iron and steel products by reducing import duty on some steel products and levying export duty on some. ‘Iron and steel’ is one product category where India has been running a trade surplus since the past two years. In FY22/FY21, the trade surplus stood at USD10.3b/USD3.8b. India’s import dependence on ‘iron and steel’ has come off over the years and stands at only 2.1% of total imports in FY22 from 2.8-3.6% over FY06-16. In fact, India’s ‘iron and steel’ exports constituted 5.5% of total exports in FY22 – the highest at least since FY04,"" domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal said in a note. Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart Ltd said, “To curb the inflationary pressures, the government has decided to levy export duty on iron ore and steel while reducing the import duty on coal, ferronickel a key raw material for steelmakers. This will ease up the steel prices, which will be beneficial to industries like infrastructure and real estate. However, steelmakers are not happy with the move as their current expansion plans were based on the assumptions of growth in global as well as domestic markets. The 15% export duty on the flat steel will make Indian steel prices less competitive globally and most of the steel producers are not sure whether the domestic market will absorb the extra production. All these factors will force the steelmakers to evaluate their future plans.""

Sensex hit a high of 54,931 and a low of 54,191 today before closing 38 points lower at 54,288.61. Metal stocks were hit hard as the government imposed export duty on 11 iron and steel intermediates. Most Asian stocks rose Monday after US President Joe Biden said he was considering lifting some Trump-era trade tariffs imposed on China, although concerns over inflation and growth weighed on sentiment.  Benchmark Indian indices closed marginally lower on Monday in volatile trade, erasing robust gains made earlier in the day.  While Sensex closed at 54,288.61, down 38 points, Nifty settled at 16,214.70, down 0.3%. Sensex hit a high of 54,931 and a low of 54,191 intraday. Metal stocks were the worst hit with Nifty Metal closing 8% lower as the government imposed export duty on 11 iron and steel intermediates. Tata Steel was the biggest laggard, ending over 12% lower. Auto, capital goods and IT indices outperformed, gaining 0.5-1%. Midcap and small-cap stocks also ended in the red today.     The United Arab Emirates’ biggest oil company and Borealis AG are seeking to raise $2 billion from an initial public offering of their chemicals joint venture in Abu Dhabi, set to be the biggest ever listing in the emirate.   Endurance Technologies Ltd. (ENDU) reported a strong Q4FY22 performance, ahead of our estimates, primarily led by strong aftermarket sales, the addition of new products and improved realisations. The consolidated revenue stood at ₹2,079 Cr (our estimate – ₹1,804 Cr), up 10% QoQ. EBIDTA came in at ₹257 Cr (our estimate – ₹183 Cr), up 27% QoQ. EBITDA margin came in at 12.4% (our estimate – 10.1%) as compared to 10.8% in Q3FY22. The improvement was due to positive operating leverage and cost savings exercises undertaken by the company supported by higher realisations. PAT came in at ₹136 Cr, (our estimate – ₹71 Cr) up 44% YoY. ENDU has been a leading auto ancillary with expertise in manufacturing technology-oriented products viz., Aluminium casting, Suspension, Braking systems, and Transmission which happen to be crucial for the ride quality and performance of the vehicles. ENDU offers strong management, a diverse revenue profile, improved technological content, increased wallet share of customers, and financial discipline. The share of EV/Hybrid technology is expected to increase in the near future as the demand in Europe shifts towards less polluting vehicles to reduce carbon footprint. In this backdrop, we estimate consolidated Revenue/EBITDA/PAT to deliver a CAGR of ~14%/25%/29% over FY22-24E. Recovery in the underlying 2W demand, improvement in the EU business from Q2FY23E, and the possibility of new product technology are potential catalysts for the stock · We maintain a BUY rating on the stock and value it at 27x FY24E P/E to arrive at a target price of ₹1,580/share ( ₹1,750/share earlier), implying an upside of 27% from the CMP.   Metals stocks started on a rusty note this week as 12 out of 15 stocks are trading in the red at the time of writing. The leaders Tata Steel, JSW Steel, SAIL, and NMDC hit their new 52-weeks lows as government levied export duties on certain steel products. Is the Metals rally over? (Read here)   Moody's Investors Service on Monday said that the imposition of higher export tax on iron ore and several intermediate products like pellets will raise costs for steel mills. However, strong domestic steel demand provides arbitrage opportunity for a portion of such exports to be diverted for domestic finished steel production, Kaustubh Chaubal, vice-president, corporate finance group, told Reuters.   Ashok Leyland Ltd (AL) reported a robust Q4FY22 performance, beating our as well as street estimates, primarily on account of healthy recovery in the commercial vehicle (CV) industry coupled with improved product mix and increase in ASPs. The net revenues stood at ₹8,744 Cr (our estimate: ₹8,205 Cr) as against ₹7,000 Cr in Q4FY21, reporting a 25% YoY growth led by robust growth in the MHCV segment and export business. The overall volumes increased by ~11% YoY to 48K units along with a 13% increase in ASPs led by a richer product mix and price increases post-transition to BS6 norms. The company’s Gross Margins contracted by 135bps YoY to 21.8% (our estimate: 22%) on account of higher RM cost inflation. AL reported an EBITDA of ₹776 Cr (our estimate: ₹606 Cr). This was mainly on account of positive operating leverage, cost savings measures, and a better product mix. The company reported PAT of ₹901 Cr while adjusted net profit stood at ₹572 Cr (our estimate: profit of ₹270 Cr) against a net profit of ₹215 Cr in Q4FY21. This was on account of adjusting the net exceptional gain of ₹470 Cr ( ₹542 Cr towards impairment reversal in the value of equity instruments in subsidiaries, ₹33 Cr related to the reversal of provision for obligation in relation to Optare Plc offset by ₹107 Cr towards loss on the fair value of investment). We expect the recovery in the CV demand to sustain and gain further momentum in FY23E and FY24E. The medium-term outlook remains strong given (1) Improving macro-economic factors; an increase in fleet utilization to drive replacement demand and the government’s thrust on infrastructure and scrappage policy; and (2) Potential pick-up in bus demand as travel restrictions ease off and schools, colleges, and offices reopen. · Hence, we retain our BUY rating on the stock and keep the TP of ₹160 unchanged as we value the stock at 19x its FY24E EPS.   The country’s GDP growth may have eased to a tepid 3.5% in the Q4 FY2022 on account of higher commodity prices, decline in wheat yields and the hiccups in the recovery of the contact-intensive services, ratings agency Icra said. The year-on-year (YoY) growth of the GDP and gross value added (GVA) at basic prices (at constant 2011-12 prices) in Q4 FY2022 seems to have eased to a tepid 3.5% and 2.7%, respectively, from the performance in Q3 FY2022 (+5.4% and +4.7%, respectively), according to Icra.   Asian stocks rose Monday after US President Joe Biden said he was considering lifting some Trump-era trade tariffs imposed on China, although concerns over inflation and growth weighed on sentiment. Tokyo closed 1.0 percent higher, while Shanghai ended flat. Hong Kong fell 1.2 and Singapore was down 0.6 percent but most other Asian markets saw gains, with Seoul, Bangkok, Taipei and Mumbai in the green.   In order to control burgeoning retail inflation, the central government has cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹8 per litre and ₹6 per litre, respectively. This reduction has led to prices of these fuels falling all across the country. All other things remaining the same, economists expect this to help bring down retail inflation by 20-40 basis points.

The stock of decorative paints maker Indigo Paints Ltd hit a new 52-week low of Rs1,375.05 on the NSE on 12 May. Compared to its stellar listing on 2 February 2021, the decline is much sharper. The stock closed at Rs3,117 on its listing day and had appreciated by 109% from its issue price of Rs1,490 apiece. Investors are well aware that the paint sector has been grappling with severe cost inflation pressures in the last few months. Spike in crude price has pushed the cost of monomers higher. Further, the recent carnage in the midcap and smallcap stocks is said to have taken an additional toll on the shares of Indigo Paints, said analysts. (Read here)   The Indian government is likely to stick to its fiscal deficit target as specified in the budget and there may not necessarily be a need for increasing government borrowing just yet, governor Shaktikanta Das told CNBC-TV18 in an interview on Monday. India on Saturday announced a series of changes to the tax structure levied on crucial commodities in a bid to insulate consumers from rising prices amid high inflation.   Inflation has been a huge concern in recent months. In a bid to offer some comfort, the government has taken some steps. Excise duties on petrol and diesel have been cut. It has raised export duties on metals and lowered other import duties. Additional fertilizer subsidy of Rs1.1 trillion has been announced to cushion farmers against impact of rising global prices. A few sectors stand to benefit from these moves, while others will suffer. (Full report)   The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is looking at more rate hikes in the next few meetings, said Governor Shaktikanta Das in an interview with CNBC TV18, adding that the central bank will also release a new inflation forecast at its June meeting.   Lupin Q4FY22 results came out to be below our expectations. The company’s gross margin stood lower at 58%, registering a de-growth of 720bps YoY, primarily due to pricing pressure and cost inflation. R&D Cost is stable while Other Expenses have increased by 15% due to the impact to the tune of $10-11 Mn of Losartan recall expenses, 4 Mn of FTS penalties, and Solosec litigation expenses. The company’s EBITDA margins fell to 6.9% due to the above reasons while adjusted EBITDA margins stood at 9.5%, below our expectations. Lupin’s reported Q4FY22 revenue grew by 2.6%, majorly impacted by lower US sales, which stood at $181 Mn (-7.2%, YoY) despite traction in Albuterol, gBrovana, and AG products sales. India sales (35%) grew 5% YoY. Growth markets (10%) were up 25.6% YoY. RoW increased 103% YoY, and EMEA by 8.6% YoY while the API was down 13.8% YoY. Lupin’s 4QFY22 EBITDA margins, adjusted for Losartan recall expenses, stood at ~9% and were significantly below our consensus expectations of ~13-14%. With intense price erosion continuing in the US market and limited new launches in 1HFY23, the company’s margins are expected to remain weak in the near term. While the management is banking on the Suprep/Spiriva launch in H2FY23 and cost optimization plans of ₹500-1,000 Cr (300-500bps of revenue) in FY23/24 to improve margins to ~18-20%, we remain sceptical given Lupin’s poor execution track-record over the past 3-4 years. In view of the prevailing lower margins and the stock’s limited triggers over the next 3- 4 quarters (before the launch of the key Spiriva opportunity), we maintain our HOLD rating on the stock with a revised TP of ₹670/share.   US President Joe Biden said the U.S. military would intervene to defend Taiwan in any attack from China, some of his strongest language yet seeking to deter Beijing from an invasion. Asked during a press briefing on Monday in Tokyo whether the U.S. would be willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan, Biden said “yes -- it’s a commitment we made."" (Bloomberg)   Shares of major steel companies slumped on Monday following the government's decision to impose export duty on 11 iron and steel intermediates and cut import duty on three key raw materials for steel production. Tata Steel Ltd, JSW steel Ltd, SAIL, Jindal Steel and Power Ltd fell over 10%, with hitting 52-week lows in opening deals on Monday. (Full report)   The initial public offering (IPO) of digital signature certificate provider eMudhra had opened for public subscription on Friday and and conclude on Tuesday, May 24, 2022. The firm has fixed a price band of ₹243-256 a share for its issue. It has raised ₹124 crore from anchor investors ahead of its issue.   Oil marketing companies --Indian Oil, HPCL and BPCL--kept the prices of petrol and diesel unchanged on Monday. The price of petrol in the national capital stood at ₹96.72 per litre, while diesel sold for ₹89.62 a litre. Domestic fuel prices had declined on Sunday in line with the cut in excise duty. Analysts said a further reduction in retail prices is unlikely as global crude oil prices remain high and OMCs have accumulated under-recoveries. On Saturday, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a reduction in central excise duty on petrol by ₹8 per litre and on diesel by ₹6 per litre. kept the prices of petrol and diesel unchanged on Monday. The price of petrol in Delhi now stands at ₹96.72 per litre, while diesel is sold for ₹89.62 a litre.   Ashok Leyland (AL) reported strong results led by ~8% QoQ growth in realisations at Rs1.79b (est at Rs1.65b). This was driven by higher MHCV volume mix at ~66% (v/s ~57% in 3QFY22) and price hikes (~2‐3% in 4Q). We are building in volume CAGR of ~26% over FY22‐24 with likely margins expansion to 10.1% by FY24 (v/s 4.6% in FY22 but ~80bp lower than FY19 peak). We believe AL’s de‐risking strategy to help as it reduces domestic MHCV exposure by adding new revenue pools such as LCVs (12‐13%), exports (9‐10% of sales) and spares (8‐9% of sales). We believe, sustenance of MHCV market share gains in 4Q (>30%) is likely led by new launches and network expansion. We upgrade FY23/24 EPS by ~7%/6% to factor in for better ASPs and cost sustainability. We re‐iterate BUY with TP of Rs163 (v/s Rs154 earlier, unchanged at ~13x of FY24 EV/EBITDA) and ~Rs13 for NBFC. AL continues to be one of our top picks among OEMs.   Prince Pipes (Prince) reported an in-line performance in 4QFY22. Revenue increased by 18% YoY (up 36% QoQ) to Rs9bn (in line with our estimate of Rs8.6bn), led by 8.8% YoY growth in realization at Rs199/kg, while volume grew by 8.7% YoY at 45,287MT. EBITDA declined by 4% YoY and was up 26% QoQ at Rs1.4bn (our estimate of Rs1.3bn), while EBITDA margin fell by 370bps YoY to 15.6% (our estimate of 15.3%), primarily due to the higher raw material costs (72.7% of sales, from 65.2% YoY). PAT declined by 9% YoY and was up 31% QoQ at Rs882mn (in line with our estimate of Rs858mn). Expansion of distribution network combined with new product launches have driven the market share gains during the quarter. Prince has made a series of strategies to embark on its journey to the next level and sustain the business in the long run with a tie-up with Lubrizol and Tooling Holland. We expect Prince to expand its leadership with the manufacturing expertise, leveraged distribution and competitive agility in the pipes sector. For FY23E/FY24E, we lower our revenue estimates by 4% each factoring the lower realization and a high base. We reduce the EBITDA margin by 120bps/30bps to factor the lower margin due to lower pricing power, which leads to a lower EBITDA estimates of 11%/6% and PAT estimates of 17%/14% for FY23/FY24. In view of the healthy performance despite challenges, cost optimization measures and series of strategies for the next level of growth, we maintain our BUY rating on the stock, with a revised Target Price of Rs780 (from Rs1,000 earlier) and a revised target P/E of 30x FY24E earnings. Single-digit Revenue Growth Expected in FY23E The company reported a healthy performance in the past few quarters, aided by continued market share gains from unorganized players. Prince reported a healthy growth in value-added products and plumbing segments, which is expected to continue with its growth journey, led by a strong uptick in the real estate demand in major urban centres. The company is likely to deliver a single-digit revenue growth in FY23E. With strong business fundamentals and opportunities in India, the management remains optimistic on leveraging its strengths to achieve a higher growth. The Union Budget has provided a strong impetus on capex with higher allocation for Har Ghar Nal Se Jal scheme, which provides significant opportunities in the coming years. Prince expects to witness a structural improvement in demand in the coming years, led by an expansion in the urban, semi-urban and rural areas, and is investing in trending activities. Outlook & Valuation The government’s thrust on Jal Jeevan Mission, enhancement of agricultural credit and increased allocation for rural infra development fund augur well for the domestic PVC pipe manufacturers. The company continued to deliver a strong performance, led by the healthy growth in agri and plumbing segments, and aided with cost optimization measures. It has made a series of strategies to embark on its journey to the next level and sustain business in the long run, with a tie-up with Lubrizol and Tooling Holland. We expect Prince to expand its leadership with the manufacturing expertise, leveraged distribution and competitive agility in the pipes sector. In view of the healthy performance despite challenges, cost optimization measures and series of strategies for the next level of growth, we maintain our BUY rating on the stock, with a revised Target Price of Rs780 (from Rs1,000 earlier) and a revised target P/E of 30x (from 33x earlier) FY24E earnings.   Gold and silver rates today edged up in Indian markets, tracking higher global rates in precious metals. On MCX, gold futures rose 0.32% to ₹51,000 per 10 gram while silver jumped 0.33% to ₹61,609 per kg. In global markets, gold edged higher to near $1,850 levels, boosted by a pullback in US dollar though higher US Treasury yields capped gains. A weaker dollar makes bullion more attractive for overseas buyers. The dollar index has recently pulled back as investors bet that easing lockdowns in China can aid global growth.   Our markets witnessed many twists and turns during the last week and on Friday the activity started with yet another gap; but this time it was fortunately on the higher side. This pleasant surprise picked up its momentum as the day progressed, to conclude the week convincingly above the 16200 mark. The second half of the week went by and was full of dramatic twists and turns. Both counterparties were caught napping in all this but as we mostly say ‘All’s well that ends well’. Eventually the bulls turned out to be victorious as they managed to pull the Nifty back inside the safe terrain by gaining over 3% from previous weekly close. With reference to our previous week’s commentary, 15700 – 15600 stands to be a very solid support; because it coincides with the ’89-EMA’ on weekly chart who has proved its mettle many times over the past many years. Yes we are not completely out of the woods but at least we are well above the crucial support zone. On the flipside, the cluster of resistance is placed around 16400 – 16500 – 16600 and till the time we do not surpass it convincingly, one should avoid being complacent. At this juncture, we are clearly mirroring US markets’ sentiments and hence, if the market has to move higher, global relief is the key. Let’s see how things pan out this week. It would be important to keep a regular tab on global developments and one should certainly be prepared for surprising moves on either side. As far as sectoral participation is concerned, we witnessed some decent relief moves in most of the beaten heavyweight spaces during the week. Also, the broader market has started to show some encouraging signs, which we believe should do extremely well if the market remains above the psychological support of 16000.   * Inflationary pressures to limit OMCs ability to recoup high marketing losses; While excise duty cuts provide an elbow room for OMCs, only a meaningful correction in crude prices will help marketing margin recovery. * Strong GRMs to partly compensate for OMCs marketing losses. The government recently announced to cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs8/6/litre given rising inflationary pressures. Accordingly, we cut FY23E earnings of HPCL/BPCL by 56-40% as we lower marketing loss for diesel to Rs3/litre (from +4/litre earlier), while increasing GRMs. OMCs ability to reduce high marketing losses of Rs6/10/litre for Q1FY23 on petrol and diesel will be contingent on crude price correction, as high inflationary pressure will prevent meaningful retail price hikes despite excise duty cuts. Also, despite excise duty cuts CNG remains cheaper by 22%/40% as compared to diesel/petrol in Delhi. City Gas Distribution (CGD) player like IGL is expected to benefit from private vehicle conversion. Reiterate ‘BUY’ on CGD companies. IGL remains our preferred pick. Oil India will be hit by reduction in excise duty as Numaligarh Refinery retains 50% of duties, however, higher product spreads will partly compensate for duty cuts. Taxes rolled back to limit inflationary pressures: Government has decided to cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs8/6/litre given rising inflationary pressures (previously duty cut of Rs5/10/litre on petrol and diesel in Nov-21). Post duty cuts, excise duty on petrol and diesel now stands at Rs19.9/15.8/litre vis-à-vis pre duty cut rates of ~Rs32.0/litre. We calculate revenue loss of Rs900bn, because of latest excise duty cuts and over Rs2.1trn due to two rounds of duty cuts. Excise duty on petroleum products is a major source of revenue for the government; Rs2.6trn for 9MFY22 and Rs3.7trn in FY21. Marketing losses remain steep, but inflationary pressure to limit price hikes: Duty cuts provide an elbow room to companies for raising prices and making up for lower margins. But with inflationary pressures, only a meaningful crude price correction will help OMCs to improve marketing margins. In Q1YTD sharp rise in petrol and diesel prices has led to drop in average marketing margins to – Rs6/10/litre (vs loss of ~Rs2.5/litre in Q4FY22). Refining spreads of petrol and diesel in Q1FY23 have increased to over USD40/bbl from Q4 average of ~USD16/bbl. Accordingly, we don’t expect OMCs to fully pass on marketing losses considering their high earnings from refining space. For FY23E we increase our refining margin estimates, while factoring in marketing margins loss of Rs3/litre for diesel. Fuel economics to support continued switch to CNG: CNG demand has recovered sharply, as economic activity picked up post pandemic. Favorable fuel economics – CNG being cheaper to diesel/ petrol by 40%/22% in National Capital Region post excise duty cuts, will drive demand for CNG among private vehicles.   A total of five stocks have been put under the ban for trade on Monday, May 2, 2022 under the futures and options (F&O) segment by the National Stock Exchange (NSE). These securities have been put on ban under the F&O segment as they have crossed 95% of the market-wide position limit (MWPL), as per the NSE.   Delhivery IPO listing: Share listing date of Delhivery is fast approaching as most likely Delhivery IPO listing date is 24th May 2022. According to stock market experts, company's financials are poor and the company's public issue is price at high valuation as well. They said that market sentiment is highly volatile and hence Delhivery shares may have a weak listing. Meanwhile, grey market sentiments are also not encouraging for the public issue. As per the market observers, shares of Delhivery are available at a discount of ₹5.   Cryptocurrency prices today surged with Bitcoin trading above the $30,000 mark. The world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency surged over 2% and was trading at $30,034.

Spot gold rose 0.2% to $1,848.96 per ounce, by 0201 GMT. Prices hit their highest since May 12 at $1,853.55 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures gained 0.4% to $1,847.90.   U.S. grains futures edged higher on Monday, lifted by a weaker dollar, an upside in crude oil and as adverse weather conditions threatened production in key producing countries. * The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was up 0.98% at $10.80-1/4 a bushel, as of 0146 GMT, after falling 0.74% last week. * Corn rose 0.71% to $7.84-1/4 a bushel and soybeans edged 0.62% higher to $17.15-3/4 a bushel. FUNDAMENTALS * Growing conditions for wheat and barley crops in France fell sharply for a second straight week, data from farm office FranceAgriMer showed on Friday, as a hot spell exacerbated drought in the European Union's biggest grain producer. * Higher oil prices further supported prices of corn, which is used to make alternative fuel ethanol.   Oil prices rose in early trade on Monday with U.S. fuel demand, tight supply and a slightly weaker U.S. dollar supporting the market, as Shanghai prepares to reopen after a two-month lockdown fuelled worries about a sharp slowdown in growth. Brent crude futures rose 82 cents to $113.37 a barrel at 0126 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures climbed 69 cents, or 0.6%, to $110.97 a barrel, adding to last week's small gains for both contracts. ""Oil prices are supported as gasoline markets remain tight amid solid demand heading into the peak U.S. driving season,"" said SPI Asset Management managing partner Stephen Innes. ""Refineries are typically in ramp-up mode to feed U.S. drivers' unquenching thirst at the pump."" The U.S. peak driving season traditionally begins on Memorial Day weekend at the end of May and ends on Labour Day in September.   Asian stocks traded mixed Monday as investors assess the impact of China’s Covid policies on growth and the outlook for the world’s largest economies. The dollar and Treasuries retreated. Equities rose modestly in Japan, but a slide in Chinese tech stocks and a virus outbreak in Beijing weighed in Hong Kong and China. Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures jumped about 1% after the S&P 500 dropped for a seventh straight week in a stretch of weakness not seen since 2001. Beijing reported a record number of Covid cases, reviving concerns about a lockdown. China’s stringent Covid Zero policy has stifled economic growth and prompted banks last week to cut a key interest rate for long-term loans by a record amount.   The dollar began the week on the back foot, following its first weekly loss in nearly two months, as investors cut bets on further dollar gains from rising U.S. rates and turned hopeful that loosening lockdowns in China can help global growth. U.S stock market futures bounced sharply in early Asia trade and pulled the risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars along for the ride.  The Aussie was last up 0.4% at $0.7080 and has lifted 3.8% in a week and a half. The kiwi rose 0.6% to $0.6450, a three-week high.  ""It's a reasonably positive start to the week,"" said National Australia Bank's head of foreign exchange strategy, Ray Attrill.

""The U.S. dollar looks, for the time being, to be losing upside momentum."" The euro and yen rose, with the yen up 0.1% to 127.83 per dollar and the euro up 0.2% at $1.0586 following last week's 1.5% gain on the dollar. The U.S. dollar index fell 0.1% to 102.790, about 2% beneath a two-decade high of 105.010 made earlier in May.   Asian stocks faced an uncertain start on Monday as persistent inflation fears and the prospect of rising interest rates dogged the global economic outlook, which remains mired in negative sentiment. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.04% higher, after U.S. stocks ended the previous session with negligible gains for the day. The index is down 3.6% so far this month. In early trade, Australian shares gained 0.2% while Japan's Nikkei stock index was 0.85% higher. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.7883% from its U.S. close of 2.787% on Friday. The two-year yield, which rises with traders' expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.5869%, up from 2.583%.

In last one month, Steel Authority of India Limited or SAIL share price has tumbled more than 22 per cent whereas PSU metal major National Aluminium Company or NALCO share price has corrected to the tune of 25 per cent in this period. Tata Steel share price has gone down from around ₹1320 to ₹1140 apiece levels, logging around 14 per cent dip in last one month. According to stock market experts, economic slowdown in China, Dollar Index rising to 34-year high and supply exceeding demand are the major reasons slide in metal stocks. They also said that Nifty Metal index has dipped from 22,000 levels to 18,800 levels and it is expected to go further down after some rebound. They went on to add that probably the 3 year strong cycle of the metal stock rally is over now and in next few quarter, it may remain under the sell-off heat. Speaking on the reasons for continuous sell-off metal stocks, Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities said, ""Metal stocks are under sell-off heat despite metal majors reporting reduction in their debt. News of slowdown in China, Dollar Index rising to record 20-year high and supply overtaking demand should be attributed as major reasons for metal stocks' correction. China is leading consumer of metals and slowdown in China has led to decrease in demand for metals. Apart form this, US dollar has been continuously gaining as Dollar Index has surged to its record 20 years high, which has made import of metals dearer for metal companies."" Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking said, ""BSE Metal index had corrected from near 22,000 levels to around 18,100 levels yesterday. However, today there is some bounce back witnessed in the index in early morning deals. The BSE Metal index has strong support at 18,000 levels and if the index breaks this support then there can be further downside in the metal stocks."" Echoing with Sumeet Bagadia's views, Manoj Dalmia, Founder & Head of Research at Proficient Equities said, ""On breakage of 18,000 support, near term target of BSE Metal index would be 17,500 levels and if further selling takes place then it might reach up to 15,500 levels.""

In March 2022, it further reduced net debt to ₹51,049 cr. Strong steel prices, disciplined capex outflow, and working capital management has put the company’s balance sheet on solid footing,"" the note stated. Sharing as its top stock pick for the week, the brokerage has maintained its Buy recommendation on Tata Steel shares with a target price of ₹1,415 apiece. Tata Steel intends to double its capacity from 19.6 mtpa to ~40 mtpa, mainly through organic expansion in India. The management highlighted a lot of optionalities to put Capex in capital-efficient and value accretive ways and is confident of enhancing capacity through internal cash flows without any issuance of debt.  Moreover, the capex intensity will be lower for the brownfield organic projects. The company has sufficient land bank to grow organically, which gives it the flexibility to pace its Capex outflow in line with the steel cycle, Axis Securities said. “The organic growth optionality allows Tata to pace the Capex in line with the steel cycle.

This is expected to lead to a comeback of private capex as companies look to further improve utilisation, as demand picks up following an easing of the pandemic and geo-political tensions. Investment activity may gain traction with improving business confidence, a pick-up in bank credit, and continuing support from government capex. Here are five stocks that could benefit from or contribute to it. #1 Larsen & Toubro (L&T) First on the list is Larsen & Toubro, a multinational conglomerate company, with business interests in engineering, construction, manufacturing, technology and financial services.

Updated: 08 May 2022,"Tata Steel to keep growing organically, new acquisitions unlikely this decade",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/tata-steel-to-keep-growing-organically-new-acquisitions-unlikely-this-decade-11652010121057.html,"Tata Steel Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director T V Narendran said the company is under 'no pressure' to look at fresh acquisitions during this decade. He added Tata Steel will grow organically in its existing sites. In an interview with PTI, Narendran said, ""Most of our growth in the last few years has been through the inorganic route (acquisitions). Currently, we are in a position where all our growth ambitions can be met through organic growth in our existing sites."" He believes Tata Steel to fuel its growth ambitions to more than double its output - further relying on organic growth at its existing sites. He added the company does not need to acquire new assets to grow its output to 40-50 MTPA (million tonnes per annum) from the present level of 20 MTPA. Talking about the expansion plans in the interview, Narendran said the NINL output will be ramped up to 10 MTPA from 1 MTPA, while the Kalinganagar plant will see an expansion to 8 MTPA from 3 MTPA, and later to 16 MTPA. The company recorded a production of 19.06 million tonnes in FY22. Notably, in 2018, the Jamshedpur-based steel giant acquired Bhushan Steel followed by Usha Martin in 2019. He is also in the process to complete the acquisition of Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL) by end of the first quarter of FY23. On Tata Steel's decision to stop coal imports from Russia after the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, Narendran pointed out that the company is aware that the same quantity can be easily sourced from other countries. ""We typically buy close to 15 MT of coal annually, of which around 3 MT used to come from Russia… which can be easily be sourced from countries like Australia, Indonesia, and Canada,"" he said in the interview further. He also ruled out a price hike scenario for steel as rates were already increased earlier this year and after the Russia-Ukraine war began. However, he expects steel prices in India to likely rise in the range of ₹8,000-8,500 per tonne in the first quarter of 2022-23 as compared to the fourth quarter of last fiscal. The CEO and MD said the demand-supply situation in the steel industry is more balanced at present and this will continue for some time. On geographical change, Narendran said, ""We are now at a stage where a few things have changed… one is China is no longer exporting as much steel as it used to in the past, other big exporting countries like Japan and Korea are also reducing shipments because they don't want to import raw materials, leave a carbon footprint and export steel."" Adding further he said, ""Therefore, we're seeing a greater restraint being exercised by most countries which have traditionally been big exporters. In Europe, Ukraine and Russia have also been large exporters, but owing to this war, they are also not in the market."" Narendra expects steel consumption to continue on its growth path in India, South East Asia, and Africa, whereas demand in mature markets is likely to be sombre. On the domestic front, Narendran said India is fundamentally a good place to manufacture steel, adding, as it has iron ore, unlike most of the other big, steel-producing countries."

In brokerage house Edelweiss' view, this is likely to brighten demand prospects. Accordingly, the brokerage remains positive on the ferrous space with JSPL (target price: ₹637) and Tata Steel (target price: ₹1,755) as its top stock picks in the metals space, mainly due to their relatively less dependence on imported coking coal. “In view of declining domestic and export realisation and firm coking coal prices, we see lower spreads as a concern in H1FY23. At its earnings call, Tata Steel management indicated that domestic margin in Q1FY23 is likely to be better than Q4FY22 as realisation uptick is likely to offset the coking coal cost,"" the note stated. However, in view of the declining spot spreads, Edelweiss believe that Q2FY23 might be challenging. That said, “we do not envisage heightened imports as domestic prices still remain on a par with the landed price of imports from South Korea and Japan,"" it added. On May 3, Shanghai’s municipal government released a list of 24 construction developments permitting a restart, including infrastructure projects. The recent permission by Shanghai municipal government to resume industrial activity is positive, as per Edelweiss. “In view of the robust credit growth and impulse in China, we believe infrastructure projects are likely to pick up once the lockdown measures are eased, which would support prices and demand,"" the brokerage note said.

A global wave of monetary tightening and commodity-fueled price pressures could yet hurt economic growth. Russia is also continuing its war in Ukraine and China’s Covid lockdowns are snarling global supply chains.  Indian stock markets gave up most of the gains, made earlier in the day, in the last hour of trade, and ended flat on Thursday. While power, capital goods and IT stocks rose, realty, FMCG and pharma indices fell 0.5-1.5%. Globally, stock markets rallied after the Federal Reserve played down chances of an even bigger US interest rate hike in the near future. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced an expected half-point increase in borrowing costs--the biggest since 2000--as part of its battle to rein in inflation. Back home, benchmark Sensex rose 33.20 points to end the day at 55,702.23, and the Nifty was up 5.10 points at 16,682.70.   Russia's foreign ministry on Thursday said it had declared seven Danish diplomats 'persona non grata' in response to Copenhagen expelling 15 Russian diplomats last month, with Moscow also objecting to Denmark's providing military assistance to Ukraine. The ministry said Denmark's openly anti-Russian policy was seriously damaging bilateral relations and that Russia reserved the right to take additional steps in response.   Sebi has restructured its committee on secondary market, which provides suggestions to the capital markets regulator on improving market safety, efficiency and transparency. The 18-member advisory committee will now be chaired by G Mahalingam, former whole time member of Sebi, latest information available on the website of the regulator showed. Earlier, the panel had 17 members and was headed by Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch. Apart from Mahalingam, the panel has CEOs of stock exchanges and depositories, representatives of various stakeholders and senior officials of Sebi as members.   Consolidated revenues for the quarter rose 8% year-on-year to ₹2518 crore in the March quarter. Sequentially, however, revenue fell 14%.   A 210 billion rupee ($2.7 billion) record share sale by state-run Life Insurance Corp. is poised to be fully taken up by investors four days before the offering closes as a low valuation and deep retail discounts drive demand. By Thursday, the second day of the offering, investors had already put in orders for 79% of the shares for sales in India’s biggest IPO. Around 35% of the total issue is reserved for retail investors and 72% of that tranche was sold 11:55 a.m. in Mumbai, stock exchange data showed. Demand from LIC insurance policyholders was for almost two-and-a-half times the amount of shares earmarked for them, while employees submitted orders for one-and-a-half times the number of shares available.   L&T on Thursday said its construction arm has won a large contract for the bullet train project. L&T Construction has bagged the project from National High-Speed Rail Corporation Ltd (NHSRCL). ""The railways business of L&T Construction has secured a·contract from NHSRCL to construct 116 route km of High-Speed ballastless track works for Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail (MAHSR) project, popularly referred to as the bullet train project,"" the company said in a statement. As per the company, a contract valued at ₹2,500-5,000 crore is a large order. Japanese Shinkansen track technology will be adopted in this project.

Nifty has seen increase in Open Interest of 26.31% with a decrease in price of -3.23% indicating Short build up. BANK NIFTY Strategy : - PUT Spread View: Moderately BEARISH. Rationale: - Traders could initiate this spread strategy to make modest returns with limited risk and reward. The spread suggested consists of buying one lot of 35,300 strike PUT option and simultaneously selling one lot of 34,800 strike PUT Option.   European stocks rose sharply at the open Thursday after strong gains elsewhere as the Federal Reserve downplayed concerns over aggressive interest rate hikes to tackle soaring inflation. London's benchmark FTSE 100 index jumped 1.6% to 7,611.14 points. In the eurozone, Frankfurt's DAX index soared 2.3% to 14,291.69 points and the Paris CAC rallied 2.4% to 6,547.67. Asian stock markets and Wall Street surged overnight after the Fed played down chances of a huge US rate hike in the near future.   Oil prices extended gains on Thursday on supply concerns as the European Union proposal laid out plans for new sanctions against Russia, including an embargo on crude in six months, offsetting concerns over weaker Chinese demand. Brent crude futures had climbed 85 cents, or 0.8%, to $110.99 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 65 cents, or 0.6%, to $108.46 a barrel. Both benchmarks jumped more than $1 a barrel earlier in the volatile session after gaining more than $5 a barrel on Wednesday.   With the current hike of 40 bps in repo rate to 4.40% it seems the rate cycle has made a U-turn (from the steep cuts seen in early 2020) and RBI would continue to increase the rates going forward and may reach the pre-pandemic level of 5.15% by end March 2023. Further, the CRR hike by 50 bps will exert further upward pressure on interest rates while sucking system liquidity by additional ₹87,000 crore. We believe this simultaneous policy announcement of adjusting both the rate and quantum of liquidity is a clever ploy and reinforces the credibility and reputation of central bank. The CRR hike could also open up space for OMO purchases by RBI. System liquidity remains in surplus, with net durable liquidity at ₹7.2 lakh crore as on 2 May.   Automakers are facing the double whammy of rising input costs and subdued demand. In response higher commodity costs, automakers have been resorting to price hikes, but this has weighed on demand. Hero MotoCorp Ltd in its March quarter (Q4FY22) earnings call said it raised prices by ₹1,000 per unit in April which is over and above the significant price hike taken in FY22. Note that in FY22, even as net realization rose by 11.2% year-on-year (y-o-y), it could only partially offset the y-o-y volume decline of 14.6% in FY22 with standalone revenue from operations falling by 5% y-o-y to ₹29,246 crore. (Read here)   The stock is currently trading at an attractive valuation of 4.4x 12MF EV/EBITDA, below its 10Y average of 6.3x. We reiterate our BUY rating and value the company using SoTP by assigning a 1-year forward EV/EBITDA based on its geographical segments. We ascribe 6.0x, 5.0x and 3.5x multiple to India standalone, other operations (excl standalone) and Europe on FY24E EBITDA to arrive at a 1-year forward TP of ₹1,700/share (unchanged from our previous TP), implying an upside potential of 35% from the CMP.   Global imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) grew 4.5% in 2021 from the previous year, supported by a surge in post-COVID industrial demand, especially in China, according to the Paris-based International Group of LNG Importers (GIIGNL). Global LNG import volumes reached 372.3 million tonnes, a rise of 16.2 million tonnes from 2020, the GIIGNL said in an annual report. The industry grew only by 0.4% during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the recovery in 2021 still lagged pre-pandemic growth of 13% growth in 2019 and 8.3% in 2018, according to GIIGNL's previous annual reports.   Automobile retail sales in India rose 37% in April on a low base of COVID-hit year-ago period, automobile dealers' body FADA said on Thursday. Total sales across categories rose to 16,27,975 units in April from 11,87,771 units a year ago. On a year-on-year basis, all vehicle categories including passenger vehicles and two-wheelers were up as compared with April last year. Passenger vehicles registrations stood at 2,64,342 units last month, up 25% on year.   Sweltering heat and ongoing blackouts are forcing India’s liquefied natural gas importers to top up with expensive shipments. Torrent Power Ltd. and GAIL India Ltd. bought LNG for May delivery in the last week, with the fuel set to be used to help power plants boost generation, according to traders with knowledge of the matter. The utilities paid about triple the normal spot rate for this time of year, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exacerbates a global supply crunch.  The purchases are unusual for India’s cost-sensitive power generators, which tend to avoid buying LNG at such high rates. They illustrate how a domestic coal shortage is forcing the South Asian nation to look for alternative fuels no matter the price, further elevating international demand.  GAIL is seeking at least one more shipment for late-May, the traders said, adding that several other Indian firms are inquiring about cargoes in the bilateral market.   Global equity markets heaved a sigh of relief after the US Federal Reserve raised key interest rates by 50 basis points (bps), lower than the feared 75bps increase. One basis point is one hundredeth of a percentage point. Post the meeting, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said US central bank officials were not actively considering a 75bps rate hike at coming monetary policy meetings. In reaction, the US equity market saw a relief rally on Wednesday. On Thursday, the Asian markets were largely higher. Nonetheless, with inflation wrecking a havoc and global central banks determined to tame it, equity markets have to get used to more and quicker rate hikes. According to James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, the possibility of a 75bps hike at the June meeting is still open. (Read here)   Activity in India's dominant services sector grew at its fastest pace in five months in April on strong demand, prompting firms to add jobs for the first time since November, a private survey showed, but sky-rocketing inflation remained a major concern. The S&P Global India Services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 57.9 in April from 53.6 in March, its highest since November and surpassing the 54.0 estimate in a Reuters poll. While the index remained above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for a ninth straight month, it was the best start to a fiscal year for the sector since 2011/12.   Indian equities were higher on Thursday, tracking Asian peers that rose as the Federal Reserve's less hawkish tone boosted investor sentiment. Benchmark indexes had closed over 2% lower on Wednesday, having posted their biggest intraday percentage loss since 7 March earlier in the session, after India's central bank hiked benchmark rate in a surprise move. At 10am, Sensex was up 502.10 points at 56171.13, and Nifty rose 156.20 points to 16833.80. About 1,996 shares advanced, 822 declined, and 86 were unchanged.   Nifty breached the support zone around 16800 on Wednesday and plunged downwards in a decisive manner. In a normal scenario, we would have interpreted this as a ‘Pennant’ breakdown and expected much lower levels; but on this occasion, we refrain from this approach. The rationale behind this is the overall oversold positioning of the market and the move has come after a surprising event. In addition, the global event US Fed meeting is slated and it would be important to see how the market reacts to it as well. Since such developments can be deceptive at times, we would rather hold our horses for a day or two and would assess the overall situation before arriving at any directional view.

Should you buy?",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/tata-steel-shares-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-after-q4-results-stock-split-announcement-11651632738643.html,"Shares of Tata Steel surged in Wednesday's opening deals after a 47% jump in its consolidated net profit at ₹9,756 crore for the quarter ended March 2022, mainly on account of higher income. The board has recommended a dividend of ₹51/sh and has also proposed a stock split of 1:10. “On the cost side, Tata expects coking coal prices to remain volatile, seaborne iron ore to remain range bound, and European power and energy costs to remain high,"" said Jefferies in a note. It has a Hold rating on Tata Steel shares with price target of ₹1,240, and sees lower steel prices as a key downside risk. The European business has surprised us positively and it could report a strong EBITDA for the next one to two quarters as well. However, with China’s economy slowing down, we expect steel prices to come under pressure. Further, India will be entering into a monsoon season in the next two months, which will cap any further price hikes from the current level, said brokerage Motilal Oswal. “For the Indian operations, volume growth will start only in FY24E and hence, the stock remains a play on steel prices till then. The strong FCF supports the downside while peak steel prices and coking coal prices cap any further margin expansion from current levels,"" as per the brokerage which has maintained its Neutral rating on the metal stock with target price of ₹1,500. “Tata Steel's year-on-year numbers are healthy as the company has got margin benefit of rise in metal prices throughout the year. Apart from this, Tata Steel has reported debt repayment of ₹50,000 crore. Tata Steel's 1:10 stock split is also going to attract small investors leading to rise in trade volume of the stock. One can expect some upside in the stock in short term,"" said Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities. The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint."
