Updated: 04 Jul 2022,Top picks: Axis Securities suggests these 3 auto stocks to buy,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/top-stock-picks-axis-securities-suggests-these-3-auto-stocks-to-buy-11656921780050.html,"Domestic brokerage and research firm Axis Securities is ‘overweight’ on the auto sector as it believes the Indian Automobile sector has seen a significant demand improvement with most categories witnessing encouraging traction.  The long-term outlook for the auto industry remains positive as demand drivers are intact and many companies may offer decent upside from current levels, the note stated. Axis Securities' top stock picks in the auto sector includes Bajaj Auto with a target price of ₹4,200, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (TP: ₹9,800), and Ashok Leyland Ltd (TP: ₹164) with buy ratings on the three auto stocks. Bajaj Auto seems to capitalize on demand normalization and premiumization trends in the 2W industry which should support profitability and operational performance going forward, said the brokerage, adding that Bajaj Auto remains its preferred pick in the 2W segment given reasonable valuations and strong medium-term growth prospects. Axis Securities believes that Ashok Leyland remains well-positioned to benefit from a strong recovery in the CV cycle on the back of new product launches and a well-diversified product portfolio. “In Q4FY22, auto companies broadly reported better-than-expected results, exhibiting outperformance on the margin front, which was aided by improving product mix, higher realizations, cost control measures, and positive operating leverage led by improving volumes. We expect new product launches to help drive excitement among buyers with the SUV segment retaining the consumer pulling power,"" the brokerage house said. Demand momentum in the commercial vehicle (CV) segment is likely to sustain and we expect the CV cycle to maintain its momentum driven by the pickup in the economic activities and the government’s focus on infrastructure, the report highlighted. Furthermore, the introduction of a duty on steel export may lead to gross margin improvement for Automakers, which is expected to translate into earnings upgrade as most of the companies are likely to retain the benefit. Based on the current development and positive outlook, the brokerage has upgraded the sector to Overweight from the earlier Equal weight stance.

In the case of petrol and diesel too, refineries sell to local customers at a price benchmarked against the international price of these fuels. “Crude prices have risen sharply in recent months. The domestic crude producers sell crude to domestic refineries at international parity prices. As a result, the domestic crude producers are making windfall gains. Taking this into account, a cess of Rs. 23250 per tonne has been imposed on crude. Import of crude would not be subject to this cess,"" finance ministry said in a statement, This cess will have no adverse impact, whatsoever, on domestic petroleum products/fuel prices, it said.

The primary reason for this has been the strength of the US dollar. At the beginning of the year, one US dollar was worth ₹74. Today, the same is worth ₹78. This means for every dollar you spend; you will have to pay ₹4 more.  This sharp move is attributable to numerous factors such as geopolitical tensions, rising inflation, and rising crude oil prices.  After a decade of historically low-interest rates and loose monetary policy, global central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, have hiked interest rates.  This move signals the end of accommodative policies, whose impact has trickled down to economies across the globe. As US interest rates rise, investors everywhere, flock to invest in the safe-haven dollar. This increased demand boosts the value of the dollar, weakening the rupee.                                                         "

The maximum offer price for the buyback will be capped at ₹4,600 per share, the Pune-based maker of two- and three-wheeled vehicles informed stock exchanges. The offer represents 9.61 % and 8.71% of the aggregate of the total paid-up share capital and free reserves of the company, Bajaj Auto added. Shares of the company ended over 1% higher to close at ₹3,855 apiece on the NSE, almost in line with a 0.85% rise in the benchmark index.

Deepak Jasani, head of research at HDFC Securities said the buyback may not result in stabilization of the stock price. The company said that is cash-rich; however, it is investing only ₹2,500 crore towards the buyback. Analysts feel that Bajaj Auto may be holding on to cash to support the share price through some more buybacks in the future. Also, it could also be that the automaker may utilize the balance cash for either capital expenditure or may be eyeing some inorganic expansion plans that need to be watched for. “Around 10% of the cash that Bajaj Auto would have in the balance sheet by end of fiscal year 2023, is being paid back to shareholders in the form of buyback of shares,"" said Deven Choksey, managing director at KRChoksey Investment Managers Pvt. “Paying back lower-yield cash to investors helps in improving earnings ratios."" The buyback comes as Bajaj Auto is set to face stiff competition from bigger rivals such as Hero MotoCorp Ltd in the switch to cleaner vehicles. Bajaj Auto earlier this month rolled out its first electric scooter from its new plant with a production capacity of 500,000 units a year, while Hero MotoCorp, the world’s top two-wheeler maker, plans to launch its first electric model on 1 July. Bajaj Auto’s wholly-owned unit Chetak Technology and its vendor partners are planning to invest nearly ₹750 crore in the new EV manufacturing facility. It has sold 14,000 Chetak electric scooters and received 16,000 bookings. With inputs from Bloomberg"

Bajaj Auto shares were trading 0.7% higher at ₹3,840 apiece on the BSE in Monday's afternoon deals. The auto major's board earlier this month had deferred a decision on its proposed share buyback, and later decided to meet on Monday, June 27, 2022 to further deliberate on the proposal for buyback of fully paid-up equity shares of the company. “We wish to inform you that the board of directors of the company (Board) at its meeting held today has approved the proposal for buyback of the fully paid up equity shares of the company having a face value of ₹10/- each from the existing shareholders of the company from open market through stock exchange mechanism at a price not exceeding ₹4,600/- per equity share and such aggregate amount, up to ₹2,500 crore, representing 9.61 % and 8.71% of the aggregate of the total paid-up share capital and free reserves of the company,"" Bajaj Auto informed in an exchange filing today.

Based on the Minimum Buyback Size and Maximum Buyback Price, the Company would purchase a minimum of27,17,392 Equity Shares,"" it added. A share buyback is a process when a company buys its own outstanding shares to reduce the number of shares available in the open market. Further, since the buyback is from the open market, the details of the actual number of equity shares that would be bought back (including as a percentage of the existing paid-up capital) and the post Buyback shareholding pattern cannot be ascertained at this stage. The company said that the same will be provided upon completion of the share buyback. The buyback comes as Bajaj Auto is set to face stiff competition from bigger rivals such as Hero MotoCorp in the switch to cleaner vehicles.

Updated: 26 Jun 2022,"Bear days are numbered, build quality portfolio. These stocks are hot picks",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/bear-days-are-numbered-build-quality-portfolio-in-markets-these-stocks-are-hot-picks-11656263787991.html,"Markets recovered last week as equity benchmarks snapped a two-week losing streak as investors took a breather from inflation concerns due to the downside in commodity prices. Going forward, markets will continue to witness volatility as bearish stick still lingers with current macroeconomic risks, however, the days are numbered. The selling pressure is expected to be short-lived and experts have advised investors to build quality stocks portfolio. On Friday, Sensex finished at 52,727.98 up by 462.26 points or 0.88%. Nifty 50 closed at 15,699.25 higher by 142.60 points or 0.92%. Both the benchmarks have gained nearly 3% each from June 20 to 24. During these days, investors' wealth on BSE climbed by ₹7,40,977.89 crore. BSE market cap stood at ₹234,86,923.67 crore on June 20 and jumped to ₹242,27,901.56 crore on June 24. Research Analysts - Dharmesh Shah, Nitin Kunte, CMT, Pabitro Mukherjee, and Vinayak Parmar at ICICI Securities in their technical note said, equity benchmarks behaved contrary to our expectations as downbeat global cues tracking anxiety around rising inflation globally, rate hikes weighed on investor sentiments. On Nifty 50, they said the velocity of the decline accelerated on breach of March low of 15700 and drifted further to the 15200 mark. Going forward, the analysts said, ""We expect the index to gradually resolve higher and extend pullback towards the 16600 regions in coming months wherein strong support is placed in the vicinity of 14800-14600 zone, which we expect to hold as it is 80% retracement of CY-21 rally (13596-18604), at 14600. Thus, dips should be utilised to construct a portfolio by accumulating quality stocks in a staggered manner."" ICICI Securities analysts' positive bias is based on four factors: 1. The reading of the percentage of stocks above 200 DMA below 15 signifies extreme pessimism in the markets that eventually leads to a technical pullback to the tune of a minimum of 10% in the subsequent three months. 2. Index has already corrected 18% from the life highs and has approached oversold reading on the weekly momentum oscillator. The weekly RSI has approached its lowest level (placed at 35) since May 2020. Historically, a reading of 35 on weekly RSI has produced a decent pullback, and the analysts expect this rhythm to maintain in the coming months. 3. India continues to relatively outperform the EM basket even in the ongoing corrective phase despite significant selling by FIIs. Over the past one year, while the MSCI EM index has corrected over 40% from highs, India has relatively outperformed as the benchmark corrected only 18%. 4. The India VIX and crude oil prices have cooled off from the recent swing high. Indian Equities have an inverse correlation with the India VIX. Thus, providing impetus for the acceleration of ongoing pullback. They added, ""On the broader market front, in three instances over the past decade, intermediate correction in the Nifty Midcap, Small cap indices have been to the tune of 28% and 40%, respectively. At present, both indices have corrected 25% and 34%, respectively."" Therefore, the analysts said, ""any further correction is likely to be short-lived amid oversold territory and would set the stage for a technical pullback in coming weeks."" Here are the top picks of ICICI Securities analysts: BFSI - SBI, HDFC, Kotak Bank, Federal Bank, and Bajaj Finance. Telecom & Technology - Reliance, TCS, Infosys, L&T Infotech, HCL Technology, and Coforge. Capital goods - L&T, ABB, Siemens, BEL, AIA Engineering, ELGI Equipment, Sanghvi Movers, and Timken India. Consumption - Hindustan Unilever, Titan, ITC, Asian Paints, Tata Consumer, Havells India, Jubilant Foods, and Astral Poly. Auto - M&M, Maruti Suzuki, Ashok Leyland, Jamna Auto, Mahindra CIE, FIEM Industries, and Minda Industries. Infra and Realty - DLF LTD, Brigade Enterprise, and Phoenix Mills. Pharma & Chemicals - Divi's Laboratories, Cipla, Syngene, Torrent Pharma, and SRF Ltd. Metal - JSW Steel, Hindalco, and Graphite. Others - Adani Port, Indian Hotels, Zee Entertainment, Trent, Concor, Nocil, Balrampur Chinni, BDL, Bluedart, Dixon Technologies, Kansai Nerolac, and NRB Bearing. Markets weekly outlook: For the week June 27 to July 1, ICICI Direct analysts expect Nifty to eventually resolve past falling channel placed at 15800 and gradually head towards 16200 levels in coming weeks. In expiry week, use dips towards 15400 to create long positions as the index is poised at extreme oversold readings. ICICI Direct analysts added that brent oil prices have breached the weekly rising trend line indicating a loss of momentum and ""we expect upsides to be capped in 125-130 zone."" According to ICICI Direct analysts, amongst sectors preferences, IT, and BFSI are key sectors with favourable risk/reward, while Auto and Capital goods are expected to extend outperformance. The analysts prefer - SBI, HDFC, Kotak Bank, TCS, Maruti Suzuki, ITC, and Titan in large caps while in midcaps we like KPIT Technologies, Federal Bank, AIA Engineering, NRB Bearings, Ashok Leyland, Automotive Axles, Bharat Electronics, Havells, Trent, and Indian Hotel. Yesha Shah, Head of Equity Research, Samco Securities said, ""The coming week has a host of events arriving which could affect the mood of the market. Globally, investors will keenly analyze the US quarterly GDP growth rate numbers. The USA would officially enter into a recession if they post a negative growth and thus this could have a spill-over effect on global markets."" ""In India, the vehicle sales figures will continue to fuel stock-specific moves on D-Street as investors attempt to decipher the future trend,"" Shah added, ""Moreover, the monthly F&O expiry in the second half of the week may cause volatility in the indices. Investors are thus advised to accumulate good stocks with strong fundamentals, free cash flows, and lower leverage over the long run while disregarding short-term difficulties."""

Updated: 24 Jun 2022,Electric two-wheeler demand intact despite fire incidents,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/electric-two-wheeler-demand-intact-despite-fire-incidents-11656050254311.html,"Recent incidents of electric two-wheelers catching fire may have added to consumers' anxiety about owning one such vehicle, but this has not considerably impacted demand.  True, the share of electric two-wheeler (2W) in the 2W segment dipped to 3.2% in May from 4.1% in April, but this has rebounded to 3.5% in June so far, according to Vahan registrations. One factor which could have slowed down this penetration could be supply chain disruptions. “Conversations on our electric vehicle (EV) tour in June suggest that the fire incidents have resulted in higher customer queries on safety but have not impacted demand much,"" said analysts at Jefferies India in a report on 22 June. The new entrants in this segment hold a significant market share whereas the incumbents are yet to expand their presence. For perspective, the market share of Ola Electric, Ampere and Okinawa stood at 23%, 14% and 22% respectively in the June quarter-to-date (Q1FY23). On the other hand, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Co.’s market share was 3.5% and 2.4% respectively in the same period. Also, there is no dearth of funds for e-2W startups. Analysts at Jefferies estimate new e-2Ws to have cumulatively raised about $1.7 billion in capital so far with Ola Electric, Ather Energy, and Ampere constituting roughly 75% of the capital. “We believe access to capital is crucial for new original equipment manufacturers’ to expand capacities and product portfolios, but funding is likely to be concentrated at a few leading OEMs with higher capital market focus on vehicle safety and in-house capabilities,"" added the Jefferies report. The electric three-wheeler (e-3W) segment is also seeing increased momentum and the government’s thrust for electrification would further aid demand. “Our conversations with MoEVing, an EV ecosystem startup for intra-city logistics, suggest that the total cost of ownership (TCO) is turning attractive for e-3Ws over internal combustion engines,"" said the Jefferies report. Assuming an eight-year vehicle usage, MoEVing estimates TCO of an e-3W including subsidy benefits is about 42% and 25% lower than diesel and CNG (compressed natural gas) three-wheeler respectively, they added. Note that the listed automakers do not have an e-3W product yet and Bajaj Auto and TVS are gearing up to launch the same. As such, it remains to be seen if the incumbents capture market share with their respective EVs. More significantly, product quality would be keenly monitored."

Nifty 50 index dipped 427 points and closed at 15,774 whereas BSE Sensex tumbled 1456 points and closed at 52,846 levels. Nifty Bank index crashed 1077 points and closed at 33,405 levels. According to stock market experts, a long negative candle was formed on the daily chart at the lows with long lower shadow. Technically, this pattern reflects ongoing down trend in the market and an attempt of downside breakout of the support of around 16,700 levels. Formation of long lower shadow signal an emergence of minor buying interest from the lows. They said that Nifty is now placed at the edge of crucial support at 15,650 to 15,700 levels. Previous opening gaps on the weekly chart have been filled soon after the opening in the past. This market action raises hopes for buy on dips opportunity. Day trading guide for stock market today Speaking on day trading guide for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said, ""The short-term trend of Nifty continues to be negative. Having reached a crucial lower support of 15,700 levels and a formation of unfilled weekly opening downside gap, there is a possibility of an upside bounce from the lows of around 15,500 to 15,400 levels in the next 1-2 sessions."" Advising traders to trade in direction of the trend, Ruchit Jain, Lead Research, 5paisa.com said, ""Our markets have been following the global cues and have been acting accordingly as we are witnessing sharp cuts in indices across the globe. The rising US Dollar index along with the bearish positions formed by the FII’s in the index futures segment had turned the trend down again last week post the pullback move up to 16,800. As of now, there’s no respite seen as the data continues to be negative for equity markets and technically also, the oscillator was back into ‘Sell mode’ on Friday last week. Hence, until we see any positive or contra signs, the trend remains down and hence, traders should look to trade in the direction of the trend."" Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com went on to add that momentum reading on the hourly charts is in oversold but not on the daily chart which is in ‘Sell’ mode. Hence, a pullback move could not be ruled out to relive the oversold set ups of the lower time frame charts. But any such pullback will be just a counter trend move and traders should look for selling opportunities in the same.

Speaking at the inauguration of Bajaj Auto's wholly-owned subsidiary Chetak Technology Ltd's dedicated electric vehicle manufacturing facility at Akurdi, Bajaj said that the people who have no business to be in the business of EVs are trying to be in this space. ""The issue is not the fire itself. This (such incidents) happened in the vehicles with internal combustion engines as well. The issue is the underlying process of the manufacturing,"" he said. He further noted that ""what concerns me more is the environment that has promoted this mad whole rush. Why are people who have no business to be in the business of EVs trying to get into the business? This must be fixed. Maybe, if I can say so, the relevant authorities in the government have diluted norms for EVs."" It (EVs flooding the market) may partly be because of the incentives as well, he said. ""Under the guise of low-speed vehicles you can bring any chunk of vehicles from anywhere and put it on the road. You will not have these scooters catching fire? What do you expect,"" he asked. Stating that the company has kept its commitment of commissioning this project by June, Bajaj said, this focused, integrated and agile facility is intended to power the Chetak's ride back to the future. ""Chetak is the original 'Make in India' superstar, which won hearts worldwide. True to those designed-and-built-in-India roots, the electric avatar of Chetak is born out of our strong R&D, deep understanding of products and consumers, and decades of manufacturing expertise,"" Bajaj said. Chetak Technology Ltd (CTL) and its vendor partners will be investing nearly ₹750 crore in this new EV manufacturing facility. Spread in 6.5-acre land, the 5-lakh annual capacity two-wheeler production plant is aimed at catering to both domestic and export markets, the company said. Bajaj had brought back its iconic Chetak scooter in electric avatar in October 2019. The company said it has sold over 14,000 Chetak e-scooters since its launch and has received more than 16,000 bookings. Co-located with a state-of-the-art R&D centre, the company's Akurdi facility aims at transforming into a major hub for the design, development, and manufacturing of EVs."

The outcome of the board meeting will be disseminated to the stock exchanges after conclusion of the meeting, the automaker further added. A share buyback, also known as share repurchase, is a corporate action to buy back its own outstanding shares from its existing shareholders usually at a premium to the prevailing market price. It can be an alternative tax-efficient way to return money to shareholders. Share buybacks reduce the number of shares in circulation, which can increase the share value and the earnings per share (EPS). Bajaj Auto Ltd reported 10% growth in net profit for the March 2022 quarter at ₹1,469 crore as against ₹1,332 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.

The union minister was speaking at the state-level Sugar Conference 2022 organised by Vasantdada Sugar Institute in Pune. He further reiterated that Bajaj TVS & Hero had brought flex engine motorcycle and autos. Diesel-based agriculture equipment should be made petrol based and flex engines can be converted to run on ethanol, he said. At the conference Gadkari stressed on the use of alternate fuels to combat increasing pollution and depletion of non renewable source of energy.  “I went behind PM and got 3 Indian Oil ethanol pumps in Pune but not a single drop of it sold yet so I want to request Ajit Pawar, let's come together & call a meeting with Bajaj,"" Gadkari said.  Gadkari asked Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar to set up ethanol pumps in Pune, to help farmers sell the fuel directly. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who addressed the conference virtually, said sugar producers in the state were facing several problems. ""We have to follow Brazil for market research. They (Brazil) conduct surveys and accordingly choose a crop in a year. Times are changing and accordingly, we should adopt technology. The future will be ethanol,"" Thackeray said. “We'll speak to Bajaj to start scooter-auto in Pune on 100% ethanol. Let's start from here. it will also reduce pollution,"" Gadkari added.  Further Gadkari said,"" Alternative fuel like ethanol & methanol as well as electric is the future. I remember, 3 years ago when I used to talk about e-vehicles, people use to question me. But see now, there is a lot of demand for e-vehicles. People are in waiting."" The Union road transport and highways minister said the country imports petroleum products worth ₹10 lakh crore to meet the requirements in the energy and power sector, and in the next five years, the demand may go up to ₹25 lakh crore, which will affect the economy. ""Alternative fuel is the future. After electric scooters, cars and buses, soon we will have electric tractors and trucks. I am going to launch these soon,"" Gadkari said.  "
Updated: 18 May 2022,Premium PV sales grow faster than lower cars,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/premium-pv-sales-grow-faster-than-lower-cars-11652894290363.html,"NEW DELHI : Cars priced above ₹10 lakh sold significantly more than those in lower-priced segments in FY22, as the wedge between income sentiments widened in the aftermath of the covid-19 pandemic. An analysis by ratings agency Crisil showed that FY22 sales of cars priced above ₹10 lakh, or the so-called premium segment consisting mostly of utility vehicles (UVs), grew 38% from the previous year, whereas cars priced lower grew at a modest 7% during the same period. This trend points towards a sharp shift in customer preference towards premium vehicle offerings, a trend in the making for quite some time, but hastened by covid-19. Premium cars now make up 30% of the total automotive market compared to 25% in FY21, the Crisil analysis showed. “Key reasons for this shift were a stark difference in income sentiment of the respective target consumers, a sharper rise in the prices of lower-end cars, fewer options (some manufacturers exited the segment), and a slew of new launches that have increased the preference for higher-priced cars,"" Pushan Sharma, director, Crisil, said. First-time buyers are also increasingly looking to buy a bigger pre-owned car that fit their budgets, than a new small car, it said. There is also a tendency among buyers to prefer new models in the SUV body style to a well-established hatch, the report added. To be sure, car prices have also gone up in tandem with rising inflation. “ There has been a 15-20% cumulative increase in the sticker price of lower-end cars over the past four fiscals due to increased stringency of safety regulations and the transition to BS-VI norms,"" said Sharma in the report. “A car is a discretionary purchase, and negative sentiments have a disproportionate effect on the car-buying decision"", Shashank Srivastava, executive director, Maruti Suzuki, told Mint in a recent interview. “Of course, the design sentiments of the Indian customers have shown a preference for SUVs that have good road presence, high ground clearance, and good stance. Entry-level SUVs overlap with premium hatch and entry-level sedans and, hence, cost- wise also, preferred by Indian customers,"" Srivastava said. The trend holds for the two-wheeler market as well. “Over the past 5-6 fiscals, two-wheelers priced over ₹70,000 have consistently sold more than those that cost less. The reasons for this are a 40- 45% increase in the cost of ownership and a 50-55% increase in the cost of acquisition since fiscal 2015. The cost of ownership has risen significantly because of tighter regulatory norms and price hikes by vehicle makers to offset higher input costs. This has materially dampened consumer sentiment and offtake of lower-priced two-wheelers,"" Sharma said. “There is a structural issue when it comes to two-wheeler and three-wheeler demand. Economic recovery is not evenly spread across lower income groups which constitutes most of our customers. 70% of customers earn less than ₹40,000 per month and 60-65% do not have an income proof. That is the type of customer we are talking about. And the continued underperformance of the two-wheeler segment demonstrates that this class of customers has been significantly weakened after covid-19,"" Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto, said in a post-Q4 earnings conference call."

So, Bajaj Auto share price has corrected around 18 per cent from its 52-week high.

Updated: 06 May 2022,TVS Motor races ahead of its peers in March quarter,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/tvs-motor-races-ahead-of-its-peers-in-march-quarter-11651819197940.html,"TVS Motor Co. Ltd has beaten peers Bajaj Auto Ltd and Hero MotoCorp Ltd on revenue growth and Ebitda margins in the March quarter (Q4FY22). Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. TVS saw 4% year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in standalone revenue to Rs5,530 crore. Net realization improved by 12.5% y-o-y led by price hikes and favorable mix, though this was partly offset by an 8% y-o-y drop in volumes. This is in sharp contrast to the 8% and 14.6% drop in Bajaj Auto’s and Hero MotoCorp’s Q4 revenue, respectively. While the former’s volumes were heavily impacted by semiconductor shortage, the latter was affected by slowdown in the entry segment. Further, TVS’ Ebitda increased by 4% y-o-y to Rs557 crore. Ebitda margin remained stable y-o-y and sequentially at 10.1% as decline in gross margin by 81 basis points (bps) y-o-y was offset by the drop in other expenses. One basis point is 0.01%. Note that Bajaj Auto (adjusted) and Hero reported a 84bps and 279bps y-o-y decline in Q4 Ebitda margin, respectively. “Diversified domestic portfolio, rising export mix and success in premium two-wheeler (2W) segment continue to drive TVS’ Ebitda growth superior to its peers,"" said analysts at ICICI Securities in a report on 6 May. The share of exports rose to 37% in Q4FY22 from 35% in Q4FY21. Automakers are facing the heat from rising commodity costs and have resorted to price hikes. In a post-earnings call, TVS said that it took price hikes of 1.5% in Q4. Moving ahead, the company expects input costs to rise further and in response there would be further price hikes. While this would weigh on demand, the expectations of a normal monsoon and waning covid cases mean the outlook for FY23 is positive. The chip shortage, which impacted production in its premium portfolio in Q4, is also foreseen to ease gradually. On the electric vehicle (EV) front, its product, TVS iQube has more than 12,000 pending bookings, as per the management. It plans to expand production capacity to 10,000 units per month by the end of Q1FY23. Further, it also aims to launch electric 2W and three-wheeler in the coming quarters. While this is encouraging, the company will have to step up its EV portfolio amid increasing competition intensity. It should be noted that TVS derives a significant portion of its revenue from ICE (internal combustion engine) scooter business which makes it vulnerable to increasing EV adoption. “We raise our FY23 earnings per share estimate by 13% to reflect the increase in prices and some recovery in domestic demand. We maintain our FY24 estimate. We maintain our neutral rating, with a target price of Rs650 per share, as valuations fairly capture the expected strength in earnings growth and the risk of an EV disruption to its scooter business,"" said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services in a report on 6 May. Shares of TVS were trading flat on Friday, a day when the benchmark Nifty 50 index was down 1.6%. In the past one year, TVS’ shares have been flattish, whereas those of Bajaj Auto and Hero have declined by 11% and 13.4%, respectively.  "

Nifty 50 index lost 391 points and closed at 16,667 mark whereas BSE Sensex crashed 1306 points and closed at 55,669 levels. Bank Nifty tumbled 899 points and closed at 35,264 levels. According to stock market experts, the present chart pattern also indicate a downside breakout of the broader high low range movement of around 17400-16900 levels. This could be considered as a downside breakout of crucial lower support in the market. This is not a good sign and could have more weakness for the short term. Bull vs bear: Day trading guide for stock market today Speaking on intraday trading strategy on Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities said, ""Having broken below the important support of 16800, the chances of further steep weakness in the near term are high. This anticipated market action could open a possibility of larger degree of lower bottom formation below 15670 levels in the next few weeks. Any upside bounce from here could find strong resistance around 16800 to 17000 levels. Immediate downside targets to be watched for Nifty around 16200 levels."" Expecting further weakness at Dalal Street, Ruchit Jain, Lead Research, 5paisa.com said, ""Since last couple of weeks, Nifty was consolidating within a broad range of 16825 -17400. Our markets needed a breakout beyond the range for a directional move and finally on Wednesday, we witnessed a breakdown from the support end. This also marks a breakdown from a ‘Bearish Flag’ pattern in Nifty on the daily chart, which triggered a short term downtrend. In derivative segment too, we saw formation of fresh short positions in Nifty as well as Bank Nifty. India VIX too surged and is hinting at higher volatility in the short term. So looking at the charts and the data, we expect the Nifty to continue its downtrend in the near term and head lower towards 16400 first. The above mentioned bearish pattern indicates a probable target around 16125, which we would expect from a positional perspective. On the flipside, the supports of 16825 and 17000 which were breached today will act as a resistance on any pullbacks."" On day trading strategy for today, Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com said, ""Traders are advised to trade with a negative bias and look for shorting opportunities.""

Updated: 05 May 2022,"Rains, weddings could lift two-wheeler demand in May",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/rains-weddings-could-lift-two-wheeler-demand-in-may-11651693081546.html,"NEW DELHI : Two-wheeler (2W) makers are betting on the forecast of a normal monsoon season and the ongoing wedding season for a revival in demand for vehicles, companies said. On Tuesday, Hero MotoCorp, the country’s largest two-wheeler maker, reported a nearly 30% decline in profit for the quarter ended March to ₹627 crore owing to subdued demand. The two-wheeler maker said it expects retail demand for motorcycles and scooters to rebound in the coming months, with the economy picking up. A normal monsoon, as forecast, is likely to aid a good harvest, which is expected to improve cash flows in rural areas, Niranjan Gupta, chief financial officer of Hero MotoCorp, told analysts in a conference call on Wednesday. “We expect the May-June marriage season demand to be very robust. Festive season pickup was quite decent during Akshaya Tritiya, Gudi Padwa and Ugadi,"" Gupta said, and added the company expects the two-wheeler industry to report double-digit growth in FY23. In FY22, two-wheeler dispatches fell 11%, hitting their lowest level in a decade. Total sales declined to just over 13 million units, significantly below the record 21 million sold in 2019, according to data compiled by the Society for Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). While Hero MotoCorp expects two-wheeler growth to revive, rival Bajaj Auto was more cautious about the demand outlook. “The current demand in two-wheelers is driven by the marriage season in north India, but demand in the second quarter of FY23 will determine the sustainability of demand in the industry at large,"" Bajaj Auto management told analysts at a conference call last week. “We see some recovery in two-wheeler sales in April, but total industry volume is still significantly below pre-covid levels, and full-blown recovery has still not happened. However, improving tractor demand and farmer incomes give hopes of a recovery coming sooner rather than later. We still maintain our two-wheeler industry growth for FY23 at 12%,"" said Jay Kale, an analyst at Elara Capital. Bajaj Auto said uneven economic recovery remains a risk to revival in demand. “Economic recovery is not evenly spread across the lower-income groups, which constitute most of our customers. 70% of our customers earn less than ₹40,000 a month, and almost 60-65% do not have income proof. That is the type of customer we are talking about. And the continued underperformance of the two-wheeler segment demonstrates that this class of customers has been significantly weakened after covid-19. Actually, the signs were there even before covid. So this is a 10-year low for the industry,"" said Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto. He added that galloping inflation is likely to dampen demand further, though the next couple of months will see good retail because of festive season demand."
Updated: 29 Apr 2022,April auto volumes preview: Recovery to be seen across segments,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/april-auto-volumes-preview-recovery-to-be-seen-across-segments-11651210667317.html," Automakers are expected to have a good start to FY23 which is evident from analysts’ expectations of growth in April 2022 volumes. True, the low base of last year aids in volume growth. But the segments are poised for recovery. Two-wheeler (2W) makers, who were impacted by subdued domestic demand in FY22, are likely to see a rebound helped by the ongoing wedding season and improved rural sentiments on the back of rabi crop harvesting. Also, increased preference for personal mobility augurs well for the 2W segment. Further, with recent incidents of electric 2Ws catching fire, ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles stand to benefit. However, the elevated fuel prices would continue to remain a risk as total cost of ownership increases. Accordingly, analysts at Sharekhan expect 2W volumes of Hero MotoCorp Ltd and TVS Motor Co. Ltd to increase by 29% and 32% year-on-year (y-o-y) respectively in April 2022. Bajaj Auto Ltd is estimated to report a 10% y-o-y decline in 2W volumes as it continues to face chip shortage. Three-wheeler (3W) sales would see increased traction as schools and offices reopen. Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor are likely to report 12% and 17% growth in 3W volumes in April, according to Sharekhan analysts. While the passenger vehicle (PV) segment is seeing increased demand, supply chain issues are impacting sales. As per Motilal Oswal Financial Services’ analysts, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s volumes in April are expected to remain flat with a drop in domestic sales offset by growth in exports. Tata Motors Ltd’s PV segment is likely to see 62% growth while Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) is expected to report 40% growth. CNG (compressed natural gas) vehicles seem to be the preferred variant in PV segment amid higher fuel prices. This is also true in the case of commercial vehicle (CV) segment where Ashok Leyland Ltd’s recently launched CNG portfolio in intermediate CV segment is seeing increased momentum, said analysts at Motilal Oswal in a report on 27 April. “Demand for cargo segment operators without long-term contracts has been impacted by high diesel prices, whereas demand from those with long-term contracts and from the infrastructure segment remains buoyant,"" added the Motilal Oswal report. Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors’ CV volumes are expected to grow by 102% and 145% y-o-y respectively. Meanwhile, demand for tractors continues to remain muted. Owing to the high base, M&M tractor volumes in April are expected to decrease by 3% while Escorts Ltd’s volumes are estimated to increase by just 1.7%, according to Sharekhan analysts."

A factor that may have helped sentiments could be the company’s resilient export markets, which contrasts with the subdued environment in the Indian market. Bajaj Auto’s key export markets include Latin America, Africa, and Asia. In FY22, the company clocked its highest-ever annual exports and its market share rose by two percentage points (pp) across regions. In the March quarter, revenue (excluding other operating revenue) fell by 8% from year-ago to ₹7,728 crore. Note that exports contributed about 52% of Bajaj Auto’s revenues. Further, weak domestic demand led to a rise in the share of export volumes to 60% in the three months ended 31 March from 54% in the year earlier. Besides, the share of three-wheeler (3W) volumes rose by 1.6 percentage points.        "

Updated: 28 Apr 2022,Chip shortage may hit 20% production in Q1: Bajaj Auto,https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/chip-shortage-may-hit-20-production-in-q1-bajaj-auto-11651086263666.html,"NEW DELHI : The global shortage of semiconductor chips is likely to hit 15%-20% of Bajaj Auto’s planned production volume this quarter, a senior company executive said on Wednesday. Production of two-wheelers, particularly sports motorcycles and electric scooters sold in the domestic market, is nearly 15% lower due to supply constraints, said Rakesh Sharma, executive director at Bajaj Auto. Outages faced by semiconductor suppliers have worsened visibility of chip availability and are also slowing down capacity expansion plans for the company’s flagship electric vehicle (EV), the Chetak, even as it aims to start manufacturing the scooter from June at a new factory, under a separate EV subsidiary called Chetak Technology Limited. “We continue to face supply chain issues in quarter one. Strategically speaking, we have been working very closely with international vendors and, in some cases, we have single source dependencies. This has allowed us to develop solutions that are very effective, but there have been unfortunate outages at their end and this now reflecting in their supplies to us. We are taking countermeasures and developing alternate sources, but the testing and validation takes time. Therefore, we see in Q1 an impairment of up to 15%-20% of what we can produce,"" Sharma said at a press conference to announce the company’s quarterly results. Bajaj Auto currently has an order book of 15,000 units of the Chetak, but it has had to go slow with opening up bookings in more cities (the Chetak is sold in 20 cities at present) lest the customer takes umbrage at delays in the delivery timeline that they will have to face, he said. “Chetak Technology will start manufacturing operations by June and we will work with whatever quantity of components we are able to procure. So, we are on track for June production with this factory in Akurdi. However, we are living week to week when it comes to chip availability, so I’m not able to say exactly how much production we will be able to do. Supply is gradually improving and we hope the trend continues,"" Sharma said. Bajaj Auto reported 10% growth in net profit for the March quarter at ₹1,469 crore against ₹1,332 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. However, the company’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) fell 10% to ₹1,396 crore, while margins shrank to 17.5% in Q4FY22, because of high raw material prices and lower domestic sales. Bajaj Auto reported its highest-ever exports volume for the financial year ended 31 March, Sharma said. “The domestic motorcycle business is facing very strong headwinds from a demand point of view,"" he said. However, the three-wheeler business for the company has been improving every month. “The three-wheeler business continues to increase month-on-month and quarter-on-quarter on the back of traffic coming back on the roads. Particularly for us, the drive by the government of India to open more and more CNG pumps and expand the CNG footprint is has been very helpful,"" Sharma said. The company expects inflationary pressures to further soften demand. “Inflation is not good for the lower-income segment of the customers as it immediately impacts their savings. A motorcycle is a consumer durable, discretionary purchase, which can always be postponed. If there is inflation, consumer pessimism starts to set in. If there is further inflation, it will definitely soften demand. That said, at some level, the economy is also doing well except that the improvement has not trickled down to this segment of the customer,"" Sharma said."

The company's EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) fell 10% to ₹1,396 crore, while margins shrank to 17.5%.

Two leading automobile companies—Bajaj Auto and Maruti Suzuki—are set to release their quarterly earnings reports this week. The national capital is witnessing a fresh surge of covid-19, forcing several states to bring back face mask mandates. Here’s all that you need to watch for this week: 1. Covid updates Covid-19 infections are again on the rise in India, primarily in and around Delhi. A new sub-variant of Omicron, BA.2.12, and its sub-lineage BA.2.12.1, are said to be responsible for the spike. The daily infection count has crossed 1,000 in Delhi, and the number of active cases nationally is inching towards 15,000. India’s effective reproduction number, or R-value, has crossed 1 for the first time since January. Some experts have called for reducing the gap between the second and third dose of the vaccine to six months, and the Centre is likely to take a call on the matter in the coming days to ensure more Indians are ready for any further surge. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization is expected to release data this week that could throw light on excess mortalities during the pandemic.

Updated: 22 Apr 2022,Focus shifts on incumbents in electric two-wheelers segment,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/focus-shifts-on-incumbents-in-electric-two-wheelers-segment-11650608491676.html,"Offerings from new-age electric vehicle (EV) startups are proving to be hazardous, with the recent instances of EVs catching fire. Against this backdrop, analysts expect there would be an increased focus on electric two-wheeler products of established, listed entities such as Bajaj Auto Ltd, TVS Motor Co. Ltd and Hero MotoCorp Ltd. “We opine that the incumbents will continue to maintain their dominance even in the new-age EV markets, led by following factors: cost advantage on the back of high scale of operation and efficient procurement; wide distribution network and market reach; technology and R&D capabilities; and investments in EV start-ups,"" said analyst at Nirmal Bang Equities Pvt. Ltd in a report on 19 April. Note that Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor have launched their EVs and are in the process of expanding their offerings to more cities, while Hero MotoCorp is set to launch its electric two-wheeler in July. Even as electric two-wheeler penetration has been going strong, overall demand for two-wheelers has remained muted. Two-wheeler wholesales declined 11% year-on-year (y-o-y) in FY22, marking the third consecutive year fall, note analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 20 April. A weak rural economy and rising inflation are among factors that have been weighing on demand. Also, high fuel prices add to the woes, hitting affordability. According to Jefferies analysts, the share of <125cc vehicles in the March quarter (Q4FY22) declined to 51% from 53% seen over FY18-FY22 while that of >125cc vehicles seem to be inching up. cc stands for cubic centimeters and denotes the volume capacity of the engine. The brokerage added, TVS Motor clocked a decadal high market share of 15% while Hero MotoCorp lost 2.6% market share in FY22. While domestic sales have remained dull, exports have grown 33% y-o-y. In the export market, TVS Motor’s market share stood at 24.5%, a gain of 1.6% while Bajaj Auto lost market share by 4.5% to 49.4%. Note that TVS’s shares have outperformed those of Bajaj Auto and Hero in the past one year. Meanwhile, the likelihood of a timely and normal monsoon is expected to boost the rural economy which augurs well for motorcycle sales, going ahead. Further, the opening of offices and colleges would also support recovery in demand for two-wheelers. Of course, a recovery in volumes would also eventually offer support to profit margins."
Updated: 12 Apr 2022,Will price hikes save the day for auto companies in Q4?,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/will-price-hikes-save-the-day-for-auto-companies-in-q4-11649745687115.html,"The recovery in demand across different automobile segments has not been uniform in the March quarter (Q4FY22). While the commercial vehicle (CV) segment is seeing a strong rebound in demand, the same cannot be said for two-wheelers (2Ws) and tractors. However, the sequential improvement in 2W and tractor volumes is encouraging.  In the passenger vehicle (PV) segment, easing semiconductor shortage is supporting the gradual improvement in demand. But rising fuel prices is a point of concern, particularly in the 2W and entry-level PV segment as it impacts affordability. Besides, higher raw material costs pose a risk to Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margins of automakers. As such, the companies have resorted to price hikes in Q4 which have shielded them from deterioration in financial metrics to an extent. “Our commodity cost index shows PVs up ~250bp (basis points) and 2Ws up 350bp from Q3FY22 levels. Our analysis of commodity contracts and inventory suggests the impact is not likely to be meaningful in Q4FY22F and may only be visible in 1QFY23F,"" said analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a report on 11 April. One basis point is one-hundredth of a point. According to analysts at Centrum Broking Ltd, the Q4FY22 revenue of Bajaj Auto Ltd and Hero MotoCorp Ltd is expected to decline by 12% and 11% year-on-year (y-o-y) respectively. TVS Motor Co. Ltd revenue is foreseen to rise by 6% y-o-y as TVS volumes were down only by 8% y-o-y as against Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp Q4 volume decline of 17% and 24% y-o-y respectively. Ebitda margins for TVS Motor is estimated to rise narrowly but Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp are expected to report decline in margins by 330bps and 100bps y-o-y respectively. In PVs, the demand in the premium segment such as SUVs has remained intact. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd PV revenues are expected to grow by 16% and 57% y-o-y respectively, according to analysts at Nomura. The CV segment is seeing a strong cyclical upturn which means companies such as Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) and Ashok Leyland Ltd are expected to report 25% y-o-y revenue growth each in Q4, as per Nomura estimates. On the Ebitda margin front, M&M is anticipated to report y-o-y decline of 264bps while Ashok Leyland’s margin is anticipated to remain flattish y-o-y. The tractor segment in M&M is partly impacting the margins. “Overall, in comparison to consensus for original equipment manufacturers, we expect beat for Maruti, M&M and Ashok Leyland but a miss for Tata Motors (Jaguar Land Rover),"" added the Nomura report."
Updated: 05 Apr 2022,Bajaj Auto's March sales volume worst hit among two-wheeler companies,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/bajaj-auto-s-march-sales-volume-worst-hit-among-two-wheeler-companies-11649139261341.html,"Bajaj Auto Ltd's two-wheeler (2W) volumes saw further decline in March, falling 8% sequentially and 22% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 2.6 lakh units. Subdued domestic demand in the two-wheeler segment coupled with a severe shortage of semiconductors led to a 41% slump in domestic volumes. Flattish exports, however, cushioned some of the fall. Meanwhile, rising fuel prices have been weighing on affordability. Bajaj Auto’s management said overall demand for motorcycles in India remains soft. “With key 2W overseas markets either showing static demand or a declining bias, we expect Bajaj Auto’s 2W export volumes to grow at 8% CAGR in FY22-FY24E,"" said analysts at ICICI Securities in a report on 31 March. CAGR is compounded annual growth rate. To be sure, Bajaj Auto’s peers also saw a year-on-year drop in sales volumes in March, even as they recorded sequential improvement. TVS Motor Co. Ltd reported a 5% y-o-y volume decline in 2Ws while Hero MotoCorp Ltd’s volumes fell 22% y-o-y. However, both saw sequential increases in volumes - by 10% and 26%, respectively. Eicher Motors Ltd's motorcycle volumes (Royal Enfield) rose 2.5% y-o-y and 14% sequentially. Going ahead, rural markets hold the key for two-wheeler demand. As such, dull demand conditions are not the only concern. Rising costs of raw materials such as steel and aluminium are likely to impact margins, and therefore pose a challenge. For Bajaj Auto, “About 15% increase in raw material basket cost would require a price hike of about ₹9000/unit, to keep gross profit/unit neutral,"" added the ICICI Securities report. The majority of cost inflation would get reflected from Q1FY23 onwards. Consequently, analysts at ICICI Securities are reducing earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin estimates for FY23 by about 300 basis points to 14.5%. One basis point is 0.01% Meanwhile, in Bajaj Auto's three-wheeler (3W) business, demand remained firm, with domestic volumes in March rising 15%. Exports fell 4% y-o-y. “We estimate 3W volumes to grow by about 22% y-o-y in FY23,"" said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services in a report on 4 April. After declining nearly 6% in CY21, shares of Bajaj Auto have risen about 17% in calendar year 2022 so far."

Sharing its top stock picks in the auto sector, JPMorgan said it has upgraded Ashok Leyland to Overweight from Neutral with target price of ₹135 as it remains bullish on the CV cycle recovery and the company has started to regain some of its lost market-share. Analysts at JPM have revised Maruti's rating to Neutral from Underweight with price target of ₹6,525, due to a combination of recent stock price correction (around 24% in 1 month) and a potential for mix shift in favour of cars in a high fuel price environment.  Further, the global brokerage's preferred picks are Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) with a target price of ₹965, Ashok Leyland and Bajaj Auto (target price: ₹3,800). It also has overweight tag on Hero MotoCorp (TP: ₹2,640) and TVS Motor (TP: ₹620). JPM likes M&M as on believing auto business recovery (SUV + LCV) should offset the weakness in tractors, and prefers Bajaj within 2Ws as its diversified revenue base should protect it from a domestic slowdown and make it a beneficiary of rupee depreciation. “We continue to be Overweight on Tata Motors (TTMT) with target price of ₹515, as the company is taking measures to reduce its leverage. However, supply chain disruptions can lead to a delay in FCF generation at JLR (similar to 1HFY22). MSIL and M&M have just started to recover from chip shortages,"" the note stated.

Updated: 24 Feb 2022,"As two-wheeler demand recovers, road is tough for margins",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/as-two-wheeler-demand-recovers-road-is-tough-for-margins-11645691154234.html,"The woes of two-wheeler companies are far from over with the industry facing risks from muted rural demand, higher commodity prices, chip shortage, and supply chain disruptions. While two-wheeler companies were hopeful of a sequential margin expansion in Q4 on the back of price hikes in January and expected stabilization in commodity costs, one variable is posing a problem now. Even as prices of steel are stabilizing, those of aluminum and precious metals are rising from November–December lows. Two-wheelers’ higher exposure to aluminum and precious metals is likely to dent margins. True, companies can resort to price hikes, but this would impact demand and affordability. “We estimate 2W (two-wheeler) original equipment manufacturers (OEM) would have to increase prices by 2.0-2.5% to fully pass on the recent impact and maintain gross margins at 3QFY22 levels"" said analysts at IIFL Securities in a report. As such, there is a slight relief as analysts believe that the demand is bottoming out now. Demand is set to rebound with the economy opening up and an expected healthy rabi crop season which will aid rural demand. The upcoming marriage season is also likely to help demand. The increased penetration of two-wheelers in Indian households over the years is proof that it is prime to India’s mobility. “The combined effect of big regulatory cost push, weak economy and Covid has resulted in 2W volume declining 34% over FY19-22E. We believe Indian 2W demand is ripe for recovery after the worst fall in five decades. We expect an urban-led revival to drive faster growth for scooters and premium motorcycles vs sub-125cc bikes"" said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd in a report Further, better growth in urban areas will favor the likes of Bajaj Auto Ltd and Eicher Motors Ltd owing to its meaningful presence in the premium segment. TVS Motor Co. Ltd is gaining an increased share in 2W exports. But concerns continue to persist for Hero MotoCorp Ltd as it primarily operates in the entry segment. Investors seemed to factored this going by the underperformance of Hero MotoCorp’s shares vis-à-vis its peers in the past one year. Besides that, Hero MotoCorp does not have a presence in the 3W segment like TVS and Bajaj and it also has a relatively lesser exposure in exports. Meanwhile, the electric vehicle (EV) segment is seeing an increase in new entrants reflecting that EV adoption is accelerating. Listed OEMs are also focusing on expanding their presence in this segment as the whole industry moves towards sustainable options. TVS Motor, Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp are either planning to launch a new electric vehicle in the coming years or expand their current offerings to more cities. “Share of EVs in 2Ws has risen from just 0.4% in FY21 to 3% (~9% of scooters) in Jan-Feb; we expect EVs to form 8% of 2Ws (25% of scooters) by FY25,"" added the Jefferies report"

Above all, he spoke his mind along the way in a manner valued widely, even if his critical reviews occasionally ruffled the feathers of our rule-makers. In 2019, Bajaj voiced what he identified as inadequate confidence among corporate leaders in the government’s appreciation of frank feedback. In the early 1990s, when Bajaj would be heard airing what the media labelled “Bombay Club"" views, his take on the economy’s liberalization kept us enthralled. His evaluation of that policy shift would improve, reflective of an openness to new evidence that was rather influential in shaping public opinion as well. About a decade later, he stirred up a discussion with a pithy expression of doubt over the benefits of business-friendly governance that was not equally good for broad economic growth. Bajaj’s voice will be dearly missed."

Updated: 12 Feb 2022,Rahul Bajaj: The man who made 'Bajaj Chetak' an aspirational symbol,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/rahul-bajaj-the-man-who-made-bajaj-chetak-an-aspirational-symbol-for-middle-class-indian-11644674429781.html,"Eminent industrialist and former chairman of the Bajaj group, Rahul Bajaj, who put Indian industry on the world map and was known for his outspokenness, died on Saturday due to age-related illness, according to a group official. Bajaj (83), who stood down from his position of non-executive director and chairman of Bajaj Auto on April 30 last year and remained as the Chairman Emeritus, was not keeping well for some time and passed away at around 2:30 pm on Saturday.  His last rites will be held on Sunday, the official said. President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed grief at the demise of Bajaj and recalled his contributions to the world of industry.  While the President said Bajaj's career reflected the rise and innate strength of the nation's corporate sector and his death leaves a void in the world of industry, Modi said Bajaj was also passionate about community service and was a great conversationalist.  Bajaj is survived by two sons, Rajiv Bajaj and Sanjiv Bajaj, and a daughter Sunaina Kejriwal. Born on June 10, 1938, he headed the Bajaj group of companies which have presence across segments such as automobiles, general and life insurance, investment and consumer finance, home appliances, electric lamps, wind energy, special alloy and stainless steel, material handling equipment and travel.  After taking charge of the Bajaj group business in 1965, Rahul Bajaj led it to the growth path. He steered the diversified entity during India's transition from a closed economy to a liberalised one and drove the company to expand its product portfolio with the Bajaj brand finding foothold in global markets while warding off emerging competition from Japanese motorcycle makers that challenged the Bajaj Auto's scooters.  Under his stewardship, flagship firm Bajaj Auto saw its turnover growing to ₹12,000 crore from just ₹7.2 crore with the firm's scooters becoming the mainstay.  The company's Bajaj Chetak scooter became an aspirational symbol for the middle class Indian families then, with the 'Humara Bajaj' tune becoming synonymous with their hopes of a better future. In 2005, he had started passing the baton of the company to son Rajiv Bajaj, who became the managing director of Bajaj Auto and led the company to become a truly global automobile player.  One of the most successful business leaders of India, Bajaj was elected to Rajya Sabha in June 2006 and remained a member till 2010. CII president T V Narendran described him as one of greatest and tallest visionary leaders, auto maker TVS chairman Venu Srinivasan said Bajaj strode across the Indian industrial landscape like a colossus.  Known for his outspokenness, in November 2019, at an event organised by the Economic Times in Mumbai where Home Minister Amit Shah, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal were present, the veteran industrialist spoke about the government's 'stifling of criticism', among other things.  ""This environment of fear, it's definitely on our minds. You (the government) are doing good work; and despite that, we don't have the confidence that you'll appreciate criticism,"" he had said.  Bajaj was recipient of many awards, including the Padma Bhushan and honorary doctorates from many universities. He also held many other positions, including the chairman of Indian Airlines and chairman of the board of governors of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.  He was also a former chairman of the International Business Council, World Economic Forum and a former member of the South Asia advisory board of Harvard Business School. Besides, he was a former member of the International Advisory Council of the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC.  The industrialist also spearheaded the CSR activities of the Bajaj Group of companies and charitable trusts including Jamnalal Bajaj Foundation. He had done BA (Honours) in Economics from Delhi University, a law degree from Mumbai University and an MBA from Harvard Business School.     "
