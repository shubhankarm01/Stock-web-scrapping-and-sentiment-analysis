Treasuries and the dollar slipped. Shares rose in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, while it fell in Australia.  Indian indices on Monday closed lower dragged by tech stocks, while global investor mood turned cautious ahead of key US economic growth data and central bank rate decisions in Europe and India this week. The Sensex lost 93.91 points, or 0.17%, to close at 55,675.32, while Nifty50 declined 14.75 points to end at 16,569.55.

On Nifty50, Bajaj Auto, JSW Steel, and Tata Consumer made the most gains, while Shree Cement, BPCL, and Asian Paints were among the biggest laggards.   The Nifty ended 3% lower month-on-month (MoM) in May 2022 as the stock registered the second consecutive month of a decline. However, the Nifty has remained resilient in CY22 year-to-date (YTD) despite multiple headwinds as strong DIIs flows continue.   India’s ruling party has been thrown into prompt damage control mode as the country’s diplomatic envoys faced music over the weekend from key West Asian trading partners over alleged anti-Prophet remarks by a spokesperson during a TV debate.

Earlier, the scrip opened flat at ₹800.25 but witnessed selling pressure later in the day. It slipped to a low of ₹782.45 in the intra-day. This is the lowest level since its listing on the stock exchanges last month.

Saudi Arabia boosted its official selling prices for Asian customers in July as China -- the world’s top crude importer -- cautiously emerges from virus lockdowns that have strained its economy. Oil has rallied almost 60% this year as rebounding demand from economies recovering from the pandemic coincided with a tightening market after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The war has fanned inflation, driving up the cost of food to fuels and prompted aggressive monetary tightening from central banks.   There has been a strong tire replacement demand in domestic market as economic revival has started taking pace. Tyre demand is robust in US & Euro region which will support exports, whereas overall demand is expected to grow by 7% in FY23, as per Axis Securities.   Multibagger stock: Amid highly volatile stock market today, Adani Power share price hit upper circuit in Monday's morning deals. The Adani group stock hit upper circuit today after hitting lower circuit on three successive previous sessions. Adani Power share price today had a gap up opening at ₹285 per share on NSE and it went on to hit intraday high of ₹298.30 per share levels.   Tata Motors today said it has bagged an order for supply of 10,000 XPRES-T EV units from BluSmart Electric Mobility. The deployment of 10,000 units makes this the biggest ever EV fleet order in India, the auto major said in a statement.   Rating: BUY | CMP: Rs251 | TP: Rs344 We attended the analyst meet of Oil India (OINL). Management guided strong volume growth FY25E to be a watershed year, driven by commissioning of major oil and gas expansion along with Numaligarh Refinery’s (NRL) expansion projects. Some key highlights are 1) Oil and gas production to increase by 30% and 70% respectively post completion of major projects in Assam 2) NRL refinery’s expansion to 9MTPA from current 3MTPA to come on stream by FY25E 3) No imposition of windfall taxes after two years of depressed profits and 4) No price cap on gas prices. OINL is well placed to benefit from rising oil and gas prices and high GRMs and FY25E EBIDTA can increase to Rs210bn (FY22-Rs105bn) on higher volumes. We maintain our estimates and retain ‘BUY’ with a PT of Rs344 based on 3.5x EV/E FY24E.   We maintain our ADD rating with a revised target price of Rs367/unit and at CMP of Rs349/unit, we estimate NDCF yield of 5.8% in FY23E and 6.2% in FY24E (over 90% tax-free returns). Key risks to our call are further rise in vacancies across assets and fall in lease rentals.   Kolte-Patil Developers Limited (KPDL), a leading Pune-based real estate developer with expanding operations in Mumbai and Bengaluru, has partnered with India's largest EV charging solutions provider, Tata Power, to install charging stations across its projects in Pune, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, providing comprehensive charging solutions to EV owners.   Multibagger stock: Investing in penny stocks is quite risky but high risk-traders prefer to invest in such low float stocks as well. However, they invest in the penny stock after gathering proper information instead of gambling. According to market magnets, investing in stock is like investing in business. So, irrespective of size of the business, one needs to check investment viability of a stock on same parameter and if the answer coming out from the balance sheet of the company is satisfactory, then one can think of investing even in a penny stock as penny stocks deliver whopping return in short term.   Multiplex stocks were under pressure on Monday as covid cases started to rise again in India with the country reporting record weekly Covid-19 cases in three months. Shares of PVR plunged about 3% to ₹1,768 whereas that of Inox Leisure declined over 4% to ₹480 apiece on the BSE in Monday's trading session.   The Adani Group has been forging ahead, cinching around 8-10 deals in the past year. Growing organically and inorganically, the group has been investing in an array of new sectors.   Reducing ‘shock and awe’ effect of omicron wave, nuclear brinkmanship, inflation scare and rising bond yield: CY22 began with the omicron scare, followed by the sudden escalation of Russia-Ukraine conflict in Mar’22, thereby pushing the world into an unprecedented phase of nuclear brinkmanship. This impacted the ‘equity risk premium’ (reflected in spike in VIX). It also resulted in a surge in commodity prices, especially crude oil, thereby triggering an inflation scare. This was followed by the more than expected hawkishness of the US Federal Reserve and India’s RBI resulting in an increase in the ‘risk free rate’ as sovereign bond yields spiked and acted as a double whammy for equity valuations. However, post the initial spurt, omicron has receded sharply while commodity prices and bond yields have started to stabilise. Also, the Russia-Ukraine conflict will likely be scaled down from global nuclear brinkmanship to a local conflict. Dip in the latest PCE inflation data for the US, general cooling down of commodity prices and the expected increase in oil output by OPEC+ will likely add credence to the peak inflation argument. Outlook and top picks: The above trends are visible in the fear index (VIX) receding and will most likely put a floor on equity valuations on a 1-year forward P/E basis, which fell from around 23x in Oct’21 to less than 18x during the May’22 sell-off. High-frequency indicators for Q1FY23 so far appear robust and indicate economic recovery is on course. Incorporating the above factors and trends, our Mar’23E target for the NIFTY50 stands at 19,000. We are overweight on stocks driven by investment rate, savings rate, credit growth, exports and pent-up discretionary consumption. Top picks: SBI, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Aditya Birla Capital, SBI Life, Larsen & Toubro, NTPC, NHPC, GAIL, Oil India, Coal India, UltraTech Cement, Bharti Airtel, Tata Communications, Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Phoenix Mills, Brigade Enterprises, Greenpanel Industries, Indian Hotels, Jubilant Foodworks, Metro Brands, Sapphire Foods, Inox Leisure, TVS Motors, Eicher Motors.  Q1FY23 is the first quarter of no covid restriction on movement since the onset of the pandemic in 2019. High-frequency indicators for the quarter so far indicate robust economic recovery, which should gather momentum going forward.   Citi Research on Monday raised its quarterly oil price forecasts for this year and its year-average outlook for 2023, because additional supply from Iran looked heavily delayed, adding to tighter market balances. Delay in Iran sanctions relief is the main factor tightening balances, Citi said. The bank now factors in Iran sanctions relief beginning in the first quarter of next year, at first adding 0.5 million barrels per day (bpd), then 1.3 million bpd over the second half. It previously expected Iran sanctions relief to add supply in mid-2022. Iran and the United States engaged in indirect talks in Vienna over the past year to revive a 2015 nuclear agreement between Tehran and world powers. Citing tighter market balances, Citi raised its second-quarter 2022 Brent price forecast by $14 to $113 per barrel, and the third and fourth quarter prices by $12, to $99 and $85, respectively. The bank estimates Brent to average $75 per barrel in 2023, revised higher by $16.   Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, raised July crude oil prices for Asian buyers to higher-than-expected levels amid concerns about tight supply and expectations of strong demand in summer. The official selling price (OSP) for July-loading Arab Light to Asia was hiked by $2.1 a barrel from June to $6.5 a barrel over Oman/Dubai quotes, just off an all-time-high recorded in May. That was much higher than most market forecasts for an increase around $1.5. Only one respondent of six in a Reuters poll had predicted a jump of $2. ""The price jump is unexpected, especially the Arab Light. We are puzzled by the decision,"" said an Asian oil trader.   Tokyo shares shrugged off early losses to close higher on Monday as tech and export shares made gains thanks to the weaker yen. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.56 percent, or 154.32 points, to 27,915.89, while the broader Topix index added 0.31 percent, or 5.97 points, to 1,939.11. The Tokyo market came under pressure in the morning as global investors interpreted solid US economic data as a further sign the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates in its fight against inflation, driving down Wall Street shares.   Shares of Rallis India Ltd dipped nearly a per cent to ₹199 apiece on the BSE in Monday's early trading session as the stock started trading ex-dividend, a day ahead of the record date for its dividend that was announced with its Q4FY22 results in April.   Multibagger stock: Rajnish Wellness Ltd has informed Indian bourses that a meeting of board of directors of the company is scheduled to be held on 13th June 2022 to consider issuance of bonus shares and stock sub-division. The company management informed about the board agenda in its latest exchange communication. Stock market observers believe that the company might be mulling stock split after its stock price surge from ₹5.56 to 187.45 apiece levels in last one year, delivering near 3250 per cent return in this period. They said that after stellar return given by this multibagger penny stock, management might have thought that subdivision of shares would enable them increase stock volume by becoming available to small investors.   India’s sovereign bond yields breached the 7.5% level for the first time in three years as the central bank’s rate-setting panel began its three-day meeting. The benchmark 10-year yield rose as much as four basis points to 7.5%, a level last seen in 2019. Yields have jumped by more than 100 basis points in 2022 amid global tightening and as the Reserve Bank of India turned hawkish with an out-of-turn rate hike last month.   Office leasing has been on an upward trajectory, aided by an accelerated shift towards grade-A properties. This was among the key highlights of the recently held analysts' day meet of Mindspace Business Parks REIT.   Surging inflation, amplified by the Russia-Ukraine war, along with faster Fed rate hikes has triggered a hawkish pivot by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In a surprise move, RBI raised the repo rate by 40 basis points to 4.4% last month in an off-cycle hike, its first increase in borrowing rates since August 2018.   Adani Transmission share price: After ushering in the new year 2022, Adani Transmission shares gave stellar return to its shareholders till beginning of May 2022. However, from first week of May 2022, this Adani group stock has been under sell-off heat. According to stock market experts, massive sell-off by FIIs, stock trading at much higher valuations and negative sentiments in the secondary markets are the major reasons for Adani Transmission share price tumble. They also said that the stock may continue to remain under consolidation till next big trigger arrived for the stock.   TVS Motor Co. Ltd is in advanced talks to raise ₹4,000-5,000 crore from private equity firms to fund the expansion plan of the group’s newly formed electric mobility arm, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.

Varun Beverages shares were trading nearly a per cent lower at ₹726 apiece on the BSE in opening deals.   Benchmark indices continued to fall on Monday, with the Sensex declining 227 points in early trade as investors remained cautious amid unabated selling by foreign funds and elevated crude oil prices. The 30-share BSE Sensex was trading 226.7 points lower at 55,542.53 points. The broader NSE Nifty fell by 67.05 points to 16,517.25 points. From the Sensex pack, Tech Mahindra, Asian Paints, Wipro, Hindustan Unilever Limited, Bajaj Finserv, Infosys, Tata Steel and Titan were the biggest laggards. In contrast, M&M and Axis Bank were the gainers. Elsewhere in Asia, markets in Tokyo, Shanghai and Hong Kong were trading in the green. Stock markets in the US had ended lower on Friday.   The rupee appreciated 4 paise to 77.62 against the US dollar in opening trade on Monday, supported by a weak American currency in the overseas markets. However, muted domestic equities, elevated crude oil prices and persistent foreign fund outflows restricted the rupee's rise, forex traders said. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened slightly strong at 77.65 against the American dollar and gained further momentum to quote 77.62, registering a rise of 4 paise from the last close. In the previous session, the rupee had settled at 77.66 against the US dollar. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading 0.04 per cent lower at 102.10. Global oil benchmark Brent crude futures rose 0.79 per cent to USD 120.66 per barrel.   Gold prices were steady on Monday, after dropping about 1% in the previous session, following a robust U.S. jobs report that signalled more interest rate increases this year, weighing on non-yielding bullion. Spot gold was flat at $1,850.60 per ounce, as of 0041 GMT, while U.S. gold futures were up 0.2% at $1,853.60.    Asian markets were mixed Monday following a steep drop on Wall Street in response to a forecast-topping US jobs report that gave the Federal Reserve room to continue hiking interest rates as it struggles to contain surging inflation. US traders took flight after the closely watched non-farm payroll figures Friday, which showed a slowdown in hiring but still with more new posts created than expected. That came as more officials suggested the Federal Reserve could continue lifting borrowing costs sharply as they try to rein in inflation. However, with prices being driven higher by factors ranging from the Ukraine war to China's lockdown-induced slowdown, there are fears the bank's measures could deal a blow to the world's biggest economy.   Cryptocurrency prices today gained with Bitcoin above the $30,000 level around which it has been trading for the past month. The world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency rose more than 4% and was trading at $30,878. The digital token is down over 35% so far this year, and trading far below its record high of $69,000 it had hit in November 2021.   Rakesh Jhunjhunwala portfolio: Va Tech Wabag shares have rebounded strongly after hitting new 52-week low of ₹223.65 levels. In last 5 sessions, this beaten-down Rakesh Jhunjhunwala stock has surged from ₹235.10 apiece levels to ₹259.35 per share mark, logging near 10 per cent rise in last one week. Uptrend in this Va Tech Wabag share price may continue as the water treatment company has recently bagger first large-scale seawater desalination plant in Senegal and the largest in West Africa upon completion.   IT major Infosys' shares have fallen 22% from its highs on the back of weak Q4 results due to margin pressures, as well as growing concerns on growth due to worsening macro and rising yields.   Multibagger stock: Global financial services group Nomura Singapore Limited ODI has bought stake in Veeram Securities Ltd.

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das headed six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is scheduled to announce the policy resolution on Wednesday,8 June.   The price of wheat has jumped in the international markets after India announced a ban on the export of the staple cereal and due to the reduced production prospects in Ukraine following the Russian invasion, the UN food agency has said. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Price Index averaged 157.4 points in May 2022, down 0.6 per cent from April. The index, which tracks monthly changes in the international prices of a basket of commonly-traded food commodities, however, remained 22.8 per cent higher than in May 2021. The FAO Cereal Price Index averaged 173.4 points in May, up 3.7 points (2.2 per cent) from April and as much as 39.7 points (29.7 per cent) above its May 2021 value.   Monetary policy tightening measures along with rising subsidies imply that the consolidated fiscal deficit may remain elevated at 10.2% of GDP in FY23, down 20bps from FY22. The government has pegged the combined fiscal shortfall at 9.8%, of which the central deficit is seen at 6.4% and states’ at 3.4% for FY23. While these measures may help to soften the inflationary pressures by ~50bps over the coming months, that will not be enough to bring inflation within the RBI’s comfort zone of 2-6%, unless global commodity prices moderate significantly. India’s merchandise exports rose by 15.5% to $37.29 bn in May’22, on account of a healthy performance by sectors like Petroleum Products, Electronic Goods and Chemicals. However, the trade deficit widened to US$23.33bn in May’22, while imports during the month grew by 56.14% to $60.62 bn.   FII selling increased to ₹400 bn in May’22, post the ₹171 bn in Apr’22; FII selling was witnessed for the 8th consecutive month in a row. They sold more than Rs2,000bn in the last 8 months, while DIIs bought shares worth Rs508bn in May’22. Ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, higher commodity prices, elevated inflation and increased expectations of aggressive Fed rate hike in the US kept the Dollar Index at 101 levels. However, we expect sustained FII inflows to resume in 2HFY23 and continue in FY23, as India is better placed compared to many other economies.   The Japanese yen was on the back foot on Monday, ahead of a busy policy-focused week in which inflation will be in the spotlight with a major European Central Bank meeting and U.S. consumer price data scheduled. The dollar climbed to 130.99 yen in early trade, a fresh one-month high, and not far from last month's 20-year peak of 131.34, after gaining 2.95% last week. The euro has also climbed on the Japanese currency and hit 140.38 yen on Monday morning, extending a seven-year high hit last week. Barclays analysts attributed last week's softer yen to a recovery in risk assets, a rise in overseas yields, a stronger dollar and higher oil prices causing concerns about Japan's balance of trade. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major peers, was at 102.1 after gaining 0.47% last week after good jobs and manufacturing data.   The worst is still to come for the Indian rupee after its slide in May to a historic low, according to analysts and forward markets. The currency may drop to between 79 to 81 per dollar over the next few months, according to analysts from UBS AG to Nomura Holdings Inc. and Bloomberg Economics. Forwards are also pricing in a similar weakness for the rupee. The bearish forecasts -- which will see the rupee drop as much as 4% from current level -- stem from a deterioration in India’s external finances. Higher oil prices threaten to widen the current-account deficit to at least 3% of the gross domestic product, compared to a 2% sustainable level, according to UBS, even as outflows from its equity markets accelerate. “A grind higher for USD/INR from here toward 80 in the next couple of months is not a big ask,"" said Rohit Arora, emerging markets Asia strategist at UBS. “Nor do I think 80 is a runaway depreciation by any metric. It’s a very modest adjustment of a currency with deteriorating fundamentals."" The rupee declined about 1.6% in May, the biggest drop among emerging Asian currencies, spurring Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das to say that the central bank won’t allow a runaway depreciation of the currency. The current account deficit can still be comfortably funded this year, he added.   Oil prices rose more than $2 in early trade on Monday after Saudi Arabia raised prices sharply for its crude sales in July, an indicator of how tight supply is even after OPEC+ agreed to accelerate its output increases over the next two months. Brent crude futures were up $1.80, or 1.5%, at $121.52 a barrel at 2319 GMT after touching an intraday high of $121.95, extending a 1.8% gain from Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up $1.63, or 1.4%, at $120.50 a barrel after hitting a three-month high of $120.99. The contract gained 1.7% on Friday. Saudi Arabia raised the official selling price (OSP) for its flagship Arab light crude to Asia to a $6.50 premium versus the average of the Oman and Dubai benchmarks, up from a premium of $4.40 in June, state oil produce Aramco said on Sunday.   Asian shares made a muted start on Monday as caution gripped ahead of a critical reading on U.S. inflation, while the euro gained on the yen amid wagers the European Central Bank will take a major step toward policy tightening this week. Oil prices jumped in early trade after Saudi Arabia raised prices sharply for its crude sales in July, an indicator of how tight supply is even after OPEC+ agreed to accelerate its output increases over the next two months. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.1%, while Japan's Nikkei eased 0.3%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures both edged up 0.1%. Markets will be on tenterhooks for the U.S. consumer price report on Friday, especially after EU inflation shocked many with a record high last week. Forecasts are for a steep rise of 0.7% in May, though the annual pace is seen holding at 8.3% while core inflation is seen slowing a little to 5.9%. A high number would only add to expectations of aggressive tightening by the Federal Reserve with markets already priced for half-point hikes in June and July and almost 200 basis points by the end of the year.

Updated: 17 Feb 2022,Nestle India’s top boss flags inflation,https://www.livemint.com/industry/retail/nestle-india-s-top-boss-flags-inflation-11645110254491.html,"NEW DELHI : Packaged foods company Nestle India is trying its best to mitigate the effects of high inflation, both for food and other commodities, and could look at pricing actions if inflation remains unrelenting, said Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director, Nestle India. “It is important to note that food inflation and commodity inflation is here to stay for a while at least,"" he said during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. The maker of Maggi noodles and Nescafe reported a 20% decline in December quarter net profit to ₹387 crore, while its operating revenue increased 8.93% to ₹3,739.32 crore. It also reported 8% year-on-year growth in domestic sales volumes, which was broad-based and largely driven by sales volume and price hikes. The company follows a January-December financial year. Nestle India hiked prices selectively up to 2% in the fourth quarter. Narayanan said prices of at least six commodities, including edible oils, arabica coffee and non-food items, such as plastic and paper, were at a decadal-high. “As far as food inflation is concerned, it is here for now. This is not a futuristic statement we are talking about. Between the December quarter and now we are seeing distinct storm clouds and, in fact, the storm is upon us…so this is what we are facing today. This is what my team and I are trying to mitigate as best as we can,"" he said. The company has been running efficiency programmes and cost-saving initiatives under project Shark, besides focussing on strategic acquisitions, to tide over the commodity headwinds. “The company has got three or four levers that it uses (to mitigate high commodity prices). One is its portfolio. Another is economies and cost efficiencies. A third is leveraging the impact of scale and the fourth is pricing. How much we will have to touch upon each one of these only time will tell,"" he said. Pricing could also be a lever if inflation remains at elevated levels in the future, Narayanan said. The company surprised investors with 9% value growth in rural markets, even as many fast-moving consumer goods peers saw a dip in rural volumes amid the stress on rural income. “We get 20-25% of sales coming from rural markets and villages actually have grown for us. We have closed Q4 at about 9% growth,"" he said. Judicious portfolio management and pushing the right stock keeping units in the rural markets helped it sustain growth, the company said. Considering that the rural markets are stressed, with job losses and pressure on household incomes, the company will “pragmatically"" but strongly enhance its semi-urban and rural distribution, he said.

Nestle India, the Indian subsidiary of the Swiss multinational FMCG giant Nestle, had to face on social media the wrath of consumers, who accused the company of hurting religious sentiments by using the sacred images on Kitkat wrappers. The company expressed regret and said that as a pre-emptive action, it withdrew those packs from the market last year. ""We do understand the sensitivity of the matter and regret if we have inadvertently hurt anyone's sentiment. We had already withdrawn these packs from the market last year. We thank you for your understanding and support,"" said a Nestle spokesperson. According to the company, these were travel packs meant to celebrate beautiful local destinations. Nestle, which owns brands such as Maggi, Nescafe, Milkmaid, Munch and Milkibar, said it wanted to celebrate the culture of Odisha with designs on packs representing 'Pattachitra'. ""Last year, we wanted to celebrate the culture of Odisha with designs on packs representing 'Pattachitra', an art form uniquely identifiable by its vivid imagery. We wanted to encourage people to know about the art and its artisans. Our past campaigns have also shown that consumers like to collect and keep such beautiful designs,"" it said. Pattachitra is an ancient Odisha-based artworks of cloth-based scroll painting. This artform is known for its intricate details as well as mythological narratives and folktales inscribed in it. It was originally created for ritual use and as souvenirs for pilgrims to Puri, as well as other temples in Odisha. Nestle India has nine production facilities with a turnover of ₹13,350 crore in 2021. Last year in April, Nestle India had also apologised for wrongly depicting Manipur's Keibul Lamjao National Park to be located in Meghalaya on the packaging of its KitKat chocolate after objection by authorities from the state government. The packaging of the particular batch of the KitKat travel break chocolate had also displayed a picture of a Red Panda, a species which is not found at the Keibul Lamjao National Park.

Updated: 17 Jan 2022,All eyes on rural demand in  FMCG  firms’  Q3  results,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/all-eyes-on-rural-demand-infmcgfirmsq3results-11642355459787.html,"Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) will announce its December quarter (Q3FY22) results on Thursday and investors are expected to closely track management commentary on rural demand. Recall that while announcing Q2 results, HUL had said recent industry trends hint at rural demand moderation, which need to be monitored. Q3 volume growth expectations are sequentially lower, but product price increases would likely support revenue growth. “Expect 9% revenue growth (for HUL), which would be pricing-led with volume growth lagging at 2%,"" said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd. As other fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies declare their Q3 results, investors can expect a similar theme of subdued volume growth and higher pricing to play out. Aggregate sector revenue growth is expected to be lower sequentially. “HPC & Foods’ (FMCG firms) volume growth rates have visibly slowed (JM Financial estimates 1-2% versus 5% in Sep-Q), with some offset from higher pricing to pass-on some commodity costs pressure,"" said analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd. “While this leads to revenue growth deceleration in staples, two-year CAGR may not be too different versus (Q2) due to higher price component,"" the brokerage said. CAGR is compound annual growth rate. Marico Ltd is expected to be one of the best performers on revenue growth. In its pre-quarter update, it said Q3 consolidated revenue growth was in the low teens. Marico’s December quarter domestic volumes are expected to be flat year-on-year (y-o-y) versus an 8% growth in Q2. On two-year revenue CAGR, both Marico and Dabur India Ltd are expected to perform relatively better than peers. Nestle India Ltd could sustain double-digit growth, even as raw material inflation dents margins, according to Jefferies’ analysts. The brokerage expects 8% y-o-y revenue growth for Britannia Industries Ltd, which would largely be pricing-led even as volumes remain flat. On the profitability front, continued commodity inflation could compress y-o-y gross margins, though sequential performance is likely to improve. Savings in advertising and promotion spends may help net profit. Overall, management commentary on demand conditions, especially rural market; margin prospects and price hikes are key factors to track. Meanwhile, FMCG stock valuations have corrected from their highs in keeping with demand worries. Bloomberg data shows that shares of HUL, Dabur India, Britannia, and Marico trade at 52.8 times, 47 times, 45.4 times, and 42 times each of their FY23 estimated earnings, respectively. In the near-term, the Omicron coronavirus variant poses a threat and some regions have imposed curbs to contain its spread. In general, analysts expect the FMCG sector to see consistent recovery over 2022, supported by minimal potential impediments due to covid-19. “While we are witnessing a covid surge, consumer behaviour shifts are no longer as dramatic as in the first two waves. The only impact we see are for (1) HUL’s personal care business, which could again see a slowdown as consumer mobility falls, and (2) Dabur’s healthcare business, which could see strong growth in consumption in this phase,"" said analysts from Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a report last week. How rural demand shapes up remains key. Gross margin pressures would continue for a while until input prices soften meaningfully, analysts said. These factors may keep investors cautious on FMCG stocks in the near future. “While staple companies face weak earnings outlook in the near term, FY23 could be a year of turnaround,"" said Jefferies’ analysts."

The third quarter of FY22 will be characterised by growth gathering pace and uptick in collections with recovery in business activities. Leading financiers have reported 3-8% QoQ loan growth and YoY growth, too, has gained traction. With lower slippages and improving collections/recoveries, we expect improvement in the overall stress pool and credit cost for banks. Behaviour of ECLGS lending pool and restructured portfolio would be key to watch out. For NBFCs/HFCs, the RBI’s notification relating to harmonisation of IRACP norms would likely result in an uptick in GNPAs. However, excess provisioning under ECL framework over IRACP norms is likely to limit rise in credit cost. HFCs are now required to implement minimum 50% LCR, the drag may weigh on their NIMs. For Q3FY22, we estimate 9% YoY growth in NII for banks, 2-4% operating profit growth while subsiding credit cost is expected to support >35% earnings growth. Preferences and recommendations: Growth momentum is gaining traction for HDFC Bank, Kotak, Federal and stress is being managed well by SBI, Axis Bank, thereby, improving visibility on earnings trajectory. We stay with them as our preferred picks. Amongst non-banks, we prefer Aditya Birla Capital, HDFC, Chola and CreditAccess Grameen.

Also, a South African study on Tuesday suggested that booster doses of the covid-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer Inc and partner BioNTech's could help to fend off infection from Omicron, even as it showed that the new strain can partially evade the protection from two vaccine doses. Those reports helped MSCI's all-country world index to close 2.1% higher on Tuesday, in its biggest percentage gain since November 2020. Oil also rose over 3%.

In an open letter to companies such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd., Marico, Dabur India, ITC Ltd., Britannia Industries, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd., Nestle India, etc the industry body has called for a non-cooperation movement from 1 January against FMCG companies if their needs are not addressed. The federation that represents over 4,00,000 distributors and stockiest has placed several demands in front of FMCG companies asking for equal treatment of all those engaged in the distribution of FMCG goods as well as seeking price parity. In its letter, AICPDF has sought one pricing and scheme pan-India—that it said will eliminate cross border flow of goods that occurs when goods are being sold at cheaper rates in different markets. It has also asked FMCG companies to “rework margins"" to take into account any incremental costs borne on account of inflation. “We are authorized channel partners of your company in our designated area. We have earned reputation and goodwill amongst our retailers by giving them good service for many years. We understand that Jiomart and other B2B companies are offering them the same products of your company at a lesser price than what we offer them and this is adversely affecting our reputation and goodwill. Hence, our demand is that we also receive those products at prices at which we also can offer the same prices as Jiomart and B2B companies,"" it said. Distributors of large fast-moving consumer goods companies have for years dominated how products reach retailers and consumers. Lately, they have been at loggerheads with consumer products companies as new-age companies offer better prices and technology backbone to retailers potentially threatening their trade. AICPDF has urged FMCG companies to ensure that no preferential treatment is given to any enterprise irrespective of its volumes. If a company is unable to provide such pricing parity, the association said it will “drop"" the products sold by Jiomart and B2B companies from its portfolio. In its letter seeking favourable terms from companies—members of AICPDF said they will sale of new products till they get a guarantee from the company that such products will not be made available on Jiomart and other business to business companies in the future. It has appealed to companies to call for a meeting with their respective distributors as well as representatives of AICPDF to discuss and “sort out the matter"". Moreover, it has sought tighter monitoring on the flow of goods seeking the formation of a draft committee as well as setting up a regulatory body with various industry stakeholders to address future issues."
Updated: 29 Nov 2021,FMCG investors in a fix on lack of clarity on rural growth outlook,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/fmcg-investors-in-a-fix-on-lack-of-clarity-on-rural-growth-outlook-11638161823326.html,"At the time when urban India was grappling with the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, rural demand had come to the rescue of makers fast moving consumer goods (FMCG). But after the second wave, things have flipped. There are concerns that the once bouyant rural demand is fading. With FMCG companies continuing to battle severe input cost inflation, muted rural demand adds to investors' discomfort. Further, the management commentaries of large FMCG companies do not provide much clarity on what lies ahead on this front. For instance, the management of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) turned a bit cautious on rural demand post the September quarter earnings. This was in sharp contrast to its views at the annual investors meet in August, where the management had said rural demand was resilient and that the company was expecting a satisfactory year. In its Q2FY22 earnings conference call with analysts, the HUL management said that it was not clear whether some softening of demand is intermittent due to unseasonal rainfall or other factors. So, it indicated that it prefers to closely watch how the rural demand pans out for a few months before reaching a conclusion. Concurring with HUL, competitor Dabur's management said rural demand was strong in the months of July and August, but September-October saw a slowdown due to liquidity pressures from wholesale channels. On the other hand, the management of Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) does not seem too perturbed by this. They feel that the slowdown in rural markets appears to be an optical illusion, due to the unnatural base of Covid-hit months. GCPL expects rural demand to be a major growth driver on the back of two focus categories − hair colour and insecticides. It should be noted that the rural market currently contributes to less than 30% of the company's sales. ""Slowdown in FMCG markets is a risk highlighted by us as well as a few FMCG companies. However, the picture on the ground is not yet clear, and while the risk remains, we refrain from actually calling out a slowdown till further data is available,"" analysts at IIFL Securities Ltd said in a report on 24 November. Speaking of data, an analysis by Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd showed that double-digit average growth in 1HCY21, rural consumption finally lost steam last quarter, declining 2.4% year-on-year in 3QCY21/2QFY22. ""As many as seven of the 11 indicators used to determine the trends in rural consumption contracted in 2QFY22, with double-digit growth in only one indicator – farm credit,"" the domestic brokerage house said in a report. ""Some FMCG companies are said to have raised prices, so concerns relating to inflation may begin to recede. But the outlook on rural demand is marred by excess rainfall spoiling crops and muted rural wage growth,"" said an analyst with a domestic brokerage house requesting anonymity. So, investors in FMCG stocks need to brace for yet another downside risk, which is likely to weigh on valuations and share prices, he added. Media reports said that HUL, ITC and Parle have raised prices in select categories of products including soaps and detergents to beat input cost inflation. According to IIFL, the inflationary environment and price hikes are making the picture more complex. ""FMCG products have a price elasticity of ~-0.5x per our experience, which means volume growth will be impacted negatively, but value growth will be impacted positively,"" added the IIFL report. It is not surprising then that the Nifty FMCG Index is lagging key benchmark index Nifty50. In this calendar year so far, the former has risen 9%, while the latter is up 22%. As far as valuations are concerned, the shares of key FMCG firms such as HUL, Nestle and Britannia among others, are trading at a one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of more than 55 times. Also, their valuation multiples are at a steep premium to their 10-year averages. The aforementioned risks could lead to moderation in the valuation multiples of FMCG companies, analysts said."
Updated: 12 Nov 2021,"Increasing prices of your morning coffee, biscuits are troubling RBI. Here's why",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/increasing-prices-of-your-morning-coffee-biscuits-are-troubling-rbi-here-s-why-11636681467462.html,"A clutch of Indian companies have turned increasingly vocal about their inflation concerns, setting the stage for raising prices that could test the central bank’s resolve to keep borrowing costs lower for longer to support the economy. Companies from Hindustan Unilever Ltd., the Indian arm of Unilever Plc, to Nestle India Ltd. have pointed to profit-squeeze from higher input costs and supply chain strains, while the likes of Dabur India Ltd., a maker of packaged honey and hair oil, and Britannia Industries Ltd. have already passed on some of the increased costs to consumers. That could see India’s headline inflation snap a four-month slowing trend in October, with data due later Friday expected to show the print inching up to 4.4%, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Consumer prices are seen accelerating further as a higher base of comparison from a year ago fades. “There is no substitute for price increases in an environment like this,"" Varun Berry, managing director at Britannia, told analysts in a post-earnings call this month. “So we have actioned price increases."" While several central banks have responded to price pressures by raising interest rates, the Reserve Bank of India has stuck with its inflation-is-transitory narrative as it sees the headline number edging lower on higher food output after a bountiful monsoon.  The expected food price-led moderation in India’s inflation was cited by Governor Shaktikanta Das as reason enough to continue with the easy monetary policy to support what he called a “delicately poised"" economic recovery. The RBI’s rate-panel is scheduled to meet early next month to review policy settings. Although the central bank sees inflation ending at 5.3% for the year ending March 2022, well within its 2%-6% target range, economists see the headline number hiding persistent price pressures. “The year-on-year estimates of retail inflation mask the real inflationary undercurrent prevailing in the economy due to statistical base effect,"" said Jay Shankar, chief economist at Incred Capital in Mumbai. “Corporate results continue to underline the raw material inflation led hit on margins, and is likely to persist for a few more quarters due to the slack in the economy."" What Bloomberg Economics Say... “Given the prospect of inflation heating up again and the recovery gathering momentum, we see a risk that the RBI raises rates a bit sooner than our current expectations for a reverse repo rate hike in April 2022 followed by a policy repo rate increase in February 2023."" -- Abhishek Gupta, senior India economist Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration last week cut an excise levy on diesel and gasoline, with an aim to check inflationary pressures and allow the central bank more room to keep borrowing costs low. The move, according to economists including those at IDFC First Bank Ltd. and Yes Bank Ltd., would help lower consumer price inflation by 10 to 14 basis points. Still, a surge in pent-up demand from Indians emerging out of lockdowns could see businesses regain pricing power that could drive inflation faster. “A substantial rise in prices charged for the provision of services in India had no detrimental impact on demand,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. “That said, service providers were concerned that persistent inflationary pressures could deter growth in the coming year."" Those are among risks, which Incred’s Shankar said could turn the RBI hawkish sooner than currently being priced in by markets. “Regardless of near-term inflation prints, the market is focused on the spillover impact of rising global commodity prices and potential Fed QE tapering on India’s monetary policy,"" said Anubhuti Sahay, an economist at Standard Chartered Plc.

Profit in the three months ended 30 September rose to ₹617 crore. The figure trailed the ₹634.7 crore consensus estimate of 11 analysts polled by Bloomberg. Eight brokerages had pegged sales at ₹3,890.80 crore. The maker of Maggi noodles and Kit Kat chocolates, which follows the January to December financial year cycle, posted a 9.6% increase in sales at ₹3,865 crore in the quarter, from ₹3,525.4 crore a year earlier. Growth during the September quarter was broad-based and largely driven by volume and mix. Export sales grew 1.3%, while domestic sales increased 10.1%, the company said. Improvement in mobility following the easing of covid-related curbs helped Nestle record growth in sales from organized retail. The company reported double-digit growth in smaller cities as well. Meanwhile, the out-of-home channel is on a recovery path with gradual opening of hotels, restaurants, offices and malls, the company said. “There are signs of a return to pre-pandemic levels of business traction in some geographies, categories and channels,"" the company said in its earnings statement. Nestlé’s prepared dishes and cooking aids portfolio comprising Maggi noodles and ketchups grew despite the high base effect of the year-ago quarter. “Maggi noodles and Maggi Masala-ae-Magic posted healthy growth, while Maggi sauces had somewhat muted growth due to decreased in-home consumption, high base and increased competitive intensity,"" the company said. Confectionery brands such as Kit Kat and Munch registered high double-digit growth aided by media campaigns, attractive consumer promotions and distribution drives. The beverages portfolio too saw “strong double-digit growth"", primarily in brands such as Nescafe classic. “This quarter has once again seen the company deliver ‘double-digit broad-based value growth’ in domestic sales across categories. Organized trade witnessed a resurgence in the third quarter with strong revenue growth in mid-20s after a muted second quarter which was impacted by the pandemic second wave,"" said Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director, Nestlé India. Narayanan said the company sustained double-digit growth in smaller cities too. “We are firmly and resolutely on a journey to accelerate it further by using a healthy mix of a customized portfolio, enhanced distribution infrastructure and deployment of resources, localized communication, enhanced visibility and building consumer connect,"" he said. Meanwhile, following the commentary by Hindustan Unilever Ltd, which too announced its September quarter earnings on Tuesday, Nestlé flagged raw material inflation in some categories. On input costs, Nestlé said the outlook for key categories such as wheat, coffee and edible oils remain “firm to bullish"", while costs of packaging materials continue to increase amid supply constraints, and rising fuel and transportation costs. Fresh milk prices are expected to remain firm with continued increase in demand and rise in feed costs to farmers. In an environment of raw and packaging material inflation, Nestlé said it will look at opportunities for cost optimization and efficiencies. Nestlé India’s third-quarter earnings were in line with estimates, said Abneesh Roy, executive director, institutional equities, Edelweiss Securities. Meanwhile, the company’s gross margins contracted by 240 basis points (bps) mainly due to elevated prices of edible oil and packaging material. “Firm milk prices also have started impacting margins adversely. Employee and overhead spend were down by 44 basis points and 111 basis points, respectively, given the company continued to remain in cost rationalizing mode even after normalization from covid-19 related disruption,"" analysts at ICICI Securities said in a note."

The advertisers are encouraged by the timing of the T20 cricket matches as they will happen in the midst of the festive season when demand for consumer goods traditionally peaks across India. Companies such as Nestle, Tata Motors, Coca Cola, Cadbury Dairy Milk and Dream11 are working on campaigns for both television and digital medium. “I expect advertisers to come back to IPL. The consumer sentiment has been upbeat, restrictions have gone down, and markets have opened up,"" said Sandeep Goyal, chairman, Mogae Media, a Mumbai-based marketing and communication agency. “The environment is better than April when the league started. There’s limited ad inventory, and the demand has been bullish, so broadcaster Star might be able to command a premium as well."" According to media buyers’ estimates, Star and Disney India are charging a premium, with ad rates being raised from ₹13-14 lakh for a 10-second slot to as much as ₹18 lakh. The second half of IPL is expected to garner advertising worth ₹1,200-1,500 crore for the official broadcaster. “The last quarter is one of the biggest, and this year will be no different. We are already seeing robust signs of recovery on media spends,"" said Navin Khemka, chief executive officer, Mediacom South Asia. “This year, we have 30 matches of IPL as well as the T20 World Cup in the last quarter, which will help in boosting ad spends."" For the first phase, held in April, the broadcaster had onboarded 17 sponsors. However, some of those such as Just Dial, Vodafone-Idea and Groww discontinued their association after the cricket league was postponed following the deadly second wave of covid-19. Currently, Star Sports has 15 sponsors, including Coca-Cola, Amazon, Asian Paints and Ajio. Star’s video streaming platform Disney + Hotstar has managed to sign a dozen sponsors such as UB (Kingfisher Packaged Drinking Water), Unacademy, Phone Pe and Swiggy. “Vivo IPL is a marquee tournament, and we are receiving a riveting response from advertisers and sponsors across linear and OTT. The second half of the league presents a unique proposition for its timing coinciding with the festive period and promises to be more intense,"" said Nitin Bawankule, head-ad sales, Star and Disney India. “There is a massive rush among brands to associate with the tournament.

We are now working on ways to replace the plastic sleeve with a paper sleeve for the straws on the pack. RCB, our partners, have always promoted environmentally responsible solutions and behaviour. They are our natural partner of choice to launch this initiative,"" said Mehernosh Malia, director-dairy, Nestlé India. One of the official sponsors, Mondelez India, is also looking at tapping IPL to promote in-home consumption. “What makes this IPL even special is that it’s coinciding with the festive season–a time focused on family togetherness and when in-home consumption will further gain precedence,"" said Anjali Krishnan, consumer experience lead, Mondelez India. “We will be leveraging this opportunity to further strengthen our connection with the consumers. We look forward to enhancing our consumers’ experience and the strong connections IPL creates year on year."" Meanwhile, associate sponsor Tata Motors has chosen to extend its association in phase two of IPL. The automaker said the more positive sentiment will be needed in the current times when the market is under pressure due to intermittent lockdowns. “Being a major partner of the league, we will be aggressively present on TV and digital platforms. Being the biggest marketing property in the country and equally watched and liked across age groups, we expect our presence in this league will provide us with unparalleled visibility and consideration in this festive season,"" said Vivek Srivatsa, head–marketing, passenger and electric vehicles business unit, Tata Motors."

Nestle is tweaking its product packaging to leverage the power of iconic brands like Maggi, Kitkat, Nescafe and Everyday to deliver the message, said Nestle India in a statement. The company will have a campaign in print and digital media informing its consumers about the packaging changes, generating awareness, said a Nestlé India spokesperson. ""Nestle India understands the need of the hour and wants to sensitise each and every individual about the one basic practice that we must all follow – Masking up,"" the statement said. The company has taken this step amid experts saying the rise in fresh cases and the R-value in many states are a worrying sign. ""To remind all of us and to create awareness on this very important safeguard, we have commenced work towards tweaking our product packaging that will see our iconic brands 'masked up'. Our aim is to ensure that this important message gets reinforced every times when consumers look at our products,"" he said. By leveraging the power of iconic brands, Nestle aims to spread even greater awareness on the importance of masking. The company has already implemented the changes at its factory lines and the products are expected to hit the market in coming weeks. ""Our brands have a rich purpose and in the past as well, packaging changes have been made to reflect important societal messages such as on 'Educating the Girl Child',"" it said. According to the latest data released by the Union Health Ministry on Monday, with 35,499 more people testing positive for COVID-19, India's infection tally now stands at 3,19,69,954.

Updated: 09 Aug 2021,Covid awareness: Nestle’s popular brands to sport masks on packaging,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/covid-awareness-nestle-s-popular-brands-to-sport-masks-on-packaging-11628505827271.html,"NEW DELHI: Nestle India is set to launch a campaign that will see the packaged foods and beverages company use masks on logos of its popular Maggi, KitKat, Nescafe and Everyday brands, aimed at promoting covid appropriate behaviour. The campaign will also be backed by print and digital activations. “Nestlé India understands the ‘need of the hour’ and wants to sensitise each and every individual about the one basic practice that we must all follow —masking up. To remind all of us and to create awareness on this very important safeguard, we have commenced work towards tweaking our product packaging that will see our iconic brands masked up,"" a company spokesperson said on Monday. Packs with tweaked logos of the four brands will hit retail shelves over the coming weeks. The India-specific packaging changes will also be accompanied by print and digital campaigns. Several companies have used covid-19 related messaging as a plank to roll out awareness campaigns. Last year, video streaming platform Netflix, online food delivery aggregator Zomato, Hindustan Unilever’s Lifebuoy, Amul, among others, leveraged public service messaging campaigns, Mint reported then. More recently, Reckitt’s hygiene brand Dettol replaced its iconic logo with stories and images of “covid protectors"" who stepped up to help during India’s severe covid-19 wave. Dettol has curated 100 such stories of frontline workers and other citizens who helped meet demand for medical oxygen and provide ration kits and medicines to those in need. Then Slice, PepsiCo's mango-based drink brand, launched an Instagram augmented reality (AR) filter that changes its logo, albeit only digitally, to reveal an inspiring story of a covid warrior. Nestle India said packaging changes have been made in the past to reflect important societal messages such as on educating the girl child. In 2016, Nestlé India had also brought about a change in packaging of Maggi, Nescafe and Kikat to support the education of girl child, in association with Nanhi Kali. Maggi, for instance, has then changed its tag line from “2 minute noodles"" to “2 minutes for education""."

The company’s net profit increased to ₹5.4 bn in the second quarter of the current year 2021, from ₹4.9 bn in the year-ago quarter. The June 2020 quarter was impacted by the nationwide lockdown. Sequentially, however, the profit declined by 10.5% compared to ₹6 bn at the end of the March 2021 quarter. Domestic sales increased during the quarter Total sales and domestic sales for the quarter increased by 13.8% and 13.7% respectively, on a base impacted by lockdowns with production disruptions across factories. Domestic sales growth was driven by volume and mix. Export sales increased by 17.7% due to timing of exports to affiliates. The company which follows January-December as its financial year, said revenue from operations grew by 14% to ₹34.8 bn compared to ₹30.5 bn posted in the same quarter last fiscal. On quarter on quarter (QoQ) basis, the figure was down 3.7% from ₹36.1 bn in the preceding quarter. At the operating level, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) increased by 13.4% YoY to ₹8.5 bn, but the margin declined to 24.4% due to rising commodity prices across oils and packaging materials. Double digit growth across key brands Nestle India continued its resilient performance posting a double digit growth across key brands despite the second wave of Covid-19 which impacted mobility to a great extent. Key products Maggi Noodles, KitKat, Nestle Munch, Maggi Sauces, Maggi Masala-Ae-Magic reported strong sales during the quarter. Nestle’s continued focus on e-commerce resulted in 105% QoQ growth and revenue contribution of 6.4%. In the first half of the year, its hyperlocal channel (which includes sales through platforms like Big Basket Daily, Super Daily, Milk Basket etc) grew 147%. Suresh Narayanan, Chairman & Managing Director, Nestle India, said in a statement, ""The company's efforts to ensure last-mile access during the second pandemic wave was aided by e-commerce and in particular hyperlocal channels which grew 147% in the first half of the year. Last year, our commitment to India made us articulate an ambition to invest ₹26 bn over a 3-4-year period. I am pleased to announce that out of this, we have already invested about ₹10 bn thus far. This is a vindication of our confidence and trust in the Nestle journey in India."" The board of the company has approved disinvestment of Nestle's entire minority stake of 19.98% in Sahyadri Agro and Dairy, a company engaged in milk collection business in western India, due to change in the business scenario. Nestle India digs deeper in the rural market for further growth After staging a comeback from the 2015 Maggi contamination crisis, Nestle India has set another ambitious target for itself. With its business growing by double digits for the past three years, the company has decided to grow its rural footprint in the coming years. The company’s decision to increase focus on rural growth by increasing village coverage by 33% through relevant rural centric products will result in strong long-term growth. This is due to rural and semi-urban markets growing at 2-2.5 times urban ones and are already contributing 20-22% of sales. Speaking of the FMCG sector, have a look at the chart below which shows the performance of BSE Sensex and BSE FMCG index since 2009.  While the Sensex has offered 393% returns since 2009, the BSE FMCG index has gone up a staggering 532% returns over the same period. Richa Agarwal, Senior Research Analyst at Equitymaster, and editor of the smallcap service, Hidden Treasure, believes this outperformance could continue for many years. As per Richa, with a rising population and standards of living, Indian's consumption demand for FMCG products will skyrocket over the coming years.

This is at a time when the base quarter is favourable as the same quarter last year was terribly affected owing to the disruptions caused by the covid-19 lockdown.

The packaged foods company’s revenues for the June quarter increased by 13.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) to ₹3,462 crore. Note that revenues in Q2CY20 had grown by just 2% y-o-y.

FMCG refers to fast-moving consumer goods. Nestlé derived more than 95% of its June-quarter revenues from domestic sales and the rest came from export sales. Domestic sales rose 13.7% y-o-y last quarter, largely driven by volume and mix.  E-commerce channels saw robust growth of 105%, contributing 6.4% of domestic sales. Export revenues grew at a faster rate of 17.7%, but this comes on a lower base. While the revenue show has been underwhelming, it is not as if margins have impressed. Commodity prices have been rising across oils and packaging materials and this impacted Nestlé, too. For the June quarter, gross margin rose 62 basis points y-o-y, but the measure was 157 basis points lower vis-à-vis the March quarter. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Meanwhile, Nestlé India has already invested ₹1,000 crore so far out of its capital expenditure plan of ₹2,600 crore (spread over three-four years). “While this is necessary for the long-term growth of the company, it could have an adverse impact on near-term earnings as capacity utilization will take a few years to ramp up. There could be some pressure on earnings due to the rise in depreciation and other costs related to starting up new capacities,"" said Credit Suisse’s analysts.

Trends in SGX Nifty suggest a flat opening of Indian benchmark indices. On Tuesday, the BSE Sensex ended at 52,578.76, down 273.51 points or 0.52%. The Nifty closed at 15,746.45, down 78 points or 0.49%. Asian shares stayed stuck at seven-month lows on Wednesday, as markets continued to digest a storm in Chinese equity markets, while the dollar rested with traders reluctant to place large bets ahead of the outcome of the Federal Reserve meeting. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.35% in early trading, having fallen in each of the three previous sessions as regulatory crackdowns in China roiled stocks in the technology, property and education sectors, leaving international investors bruised. Japan's Nikkei slid 1.01%, Chinese bluechips dropped 1.51%, and Australian shares fell 0.43%. Hong Kong bucked the trend, rising 0.63%, after closing at its lowest level since November the day before. The statement from the Fed policy meeting, and a press conference from chairman Jerome Powell are due tonight. Markets will be watching closely for any hints in relation to inflation, economic growth, interest rates and when the Fed will likely start reducing its purchases of government bonds. The declines in Asian equities on Tuesday spread to other markets overnight, causing Wall Street to retreat a little from the record highs set earlier in the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended Tuesday down 0.2%, the S&P 500 shed 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.2%. Earlier the pan-European STOXX 600 index finished 0.54% lower. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday slashed India’s economic growth projection for FY22 to 9.5% from 12.5% estimated in April, citing a slow recovery in consumer confidence because of the ferocious second wave of the pandemic and a tardy vaccination programme. Among key companies Maruti Suzuki, Nestle (India), IDBI Bank, United Breweries, ABB India, Pfizer, Central Bank of India, Happiest Minds Technologies, and UTI Asset Management will declare their March quarter results. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), the transport and logistics arm of billionaire Gautam Adani’s group of companies, on Tuesday said it has raised $750 million from overseas investors through a bond offering. Adani Ports, in a statement, said it has priced the $750 million senior unsecured USD notes issuance with 20 years and 10.5 years tranches at a fixed coupon of 5.0% and 3.8% respectively. The issuances were oversubscribed over three times, the company said. In currency markets, the US dollar sat below recent highs after a month long rally, the safe-haven yen gained and the risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars dropped back. Oil prices rose as industry data showed US crude and product inventories fell more sharply than expected last week, outweighing worries about the consequences of surging covid-19 cases. U.S. crude ticked up 0.47% to $72.01 a barrel and Brent crude rose 0.35% to $74.77 per barrel. Gold was slightly lower, with spot trading at $1,798.45 per ounce. (Reuters contributed to the story)"

Updated: 22 Apr 2021,"Nestle India’s Q1 provides comfort, but high costs pose risk to margins",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/nestle-india-s-q1-provides-comfort-but-high-costs-pose-risk-to-margins-11619033559035.html,"With more people staying indoors due to the second covid wave, in-home consumption of packaged foods is expected to be good. Nestlé India Ltd is likely to benefit from this trend in the foreseeable future. On the other hand, inflation in key raw materials poses a concern for gross profit margins. However, some analysts point out that Nestlé may not be too severely impacted vis-à-vis other consumer firms.   Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd’s analysts said in a report on 20 April: “While Nestlé is witnessing recent escalation in key commodities, we note that agri-basket inflation is still lower versus crude basket. And with Nestlé’s greater skew towards agri inputs and superior pricing power, we believe its gross profit margin will be relatively less impacted versus peers."" Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd said inflation in key input prices appears manageable (for Nestlé) and can be largely offset by modest price hikes. In the March quarter (Q1CY21), Nestlé’s gross margin expanded by 223 basis points year-on-year (y-o-y), helped by a drop in raw material costs as a percentage of revenue, as commodity prices were lower y-o-y, particularly for milk and its derivatives. One basis point is 0.01%. Accordingly, Nestlé’s gross profit increased by around 13% y-o-y, faster than its revenue growth. Even so, revenues for the March quarter are in line with analysts’ expectations. Total operating revenues rose by 8.6% y-o-y to around ₹3,611 crore. In Q1, Nestlé derived as much as 95% of its overall revenues from domestic sales, which grew 10.2% y-o-y driven by volume and mix. Domestic performance is encouraging considering that the first quarter of 2020 had seen similar growth and, therefore, the base isn’t particularly favourable. Further, export sales fell by about 13% y-o-y owing to lower shipments to affiliates. According to Nestlé, while demand in the out-of-home channel further improved in the March quarter, it continues to be impacted by the pandemic. Analysts expect out-of-home consumption to be impacted by covid-led restrictions. To be sure, Nestlé’s overall growth prospects are expected to be better comparatively. The pricey valuations of Nestlé India shares suggest that investors are capturing a good share of the optimism from a near-term perspective. The stock trades at almost 58 times estimated earnings for calendar year 2022, according to Bloomberg data. Nestlé follows the January to December financial year. So far this calendar year, the Nestlé India stock has declined by 7%, though it is still up by around 2% from its pre-covid highs seen in February 2020."

Revenue from operations for the quarter ended March 31 was up 8.5% at Rs3610.82 crore from the Rs3,325.27 crore it reported in the year ago period. The maker of Maggi noodles and Nescafe coffee reported a 10.2% jump in domestic sales that stood at Rs3,442 crore for the quarter as key brands within its portfolio, benefitting from at-home consumption, posted double-digit growth. The growth was broad based and largely driven by volumes and mix, it said. The company, however, said that recent ""sharp escalations"" in key raw material prices is posing a challenge. It specially pointed out to headwinds in commodity and packaging materials. Total expenses for the quarter stood at ₹2,828.61 crore up 6.1% from the same quarter last year. Nestle India follows a January-December financial year. “While the Nestlé India family has learnt to cope with the operating volatility in the pandemic, recent sharp escalations in key raw material prices poses challenges that we will resolutely respond to, while maintaining the integrity of our business model,"" Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director, Nestlé India said. Key brands like Maggi Noodles, Kitkat, Nescafe Classic, Maggi sauces, Milkmaid, Maggi Masala-Ae-Magic delivered robust performance and achieved double digit growth, he said. Demand in out-of-home consumption channel further improved during the quarter but continues to be impacted by covid, the company said. Large FMCG companies were expected to perform well in the March quarter, helped by a lower base in the year-ago quarter when sales were partially impacted as India moved to a lockdown towards the end of March. Nestle India, however, reported a jump in sales on a higher base quarter. ""Nestle India reported strong first quarter results with overall numbers marginally ahead of our expectations, said Abneesh Roy, Executive Vice President, Edelweiss Securities. “Overall sales increased by 9% y-o-y on a relatively high base compared to other peers at around 11%. The good part was both gross margins and EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization margins expanded strongly. This is a very rare feat in March quarter for consumer companies, most companies will see a gross margin compression,"" he said. During the quarter—e-commerce continued to deliver strong performance and grew by 66%. By the end of the first quarter—contribution of e-commerce to domestic business stood at 3.8%. Export sales were lower by 12.9% due to lower exports to affiliates, the company said. EBITDA margin expanded 168bps y-o-y and gross margins expanded by 223bps y-o-y, during the quarter. “We believe the company was holding low cost skimmed milk powder inventory, which helped it maintaining high gross margin during the quarter,"" analysts at ICICI Securities said in a post earnings note.. The company also controlled employee costs during the quarter. ""Employee spend was lower by 58 bps (as percentage to sales) whereas overhead spends were higher by 131 bps (as % to sales),"" ICICI Securities said. The company, in collaboration with authorities, is looking at setting up vaccination camps across its manufacturing locations, Narayanan said. ""This will provide with ease, much needed vaccination of our factory employees in the eligible age group. We are pleased to be in the process of extending our pioneering industry commitment of Nestlé Suraksha medical insurance protection, to our distributor salesforce against COVID-19 for an additional year,"" he added."

The fast-moving consumer goods’ (FMCG) company follows a January-December financial year. The company’s total operating revenues in 2020 increased by almost 8% over the same period last year to ₹13350 crore. Among the segments, in 2020, milk products & nutrition contributed 46.3% of operating revenues. Prepared dishes and cooking aids, powdered and liquid beverages, and confectionery accounted for 29.4%, 11.1% and 13.2% of the last year’s revenues, respectively. Nestle India derives a large portion of its revenues from domestic sales and in 2020, this stood at 94.7% of overall revenues. While domestic sales in 2020 increased by 8.5% year-on-year in 2020, the covid-19 lockdown adversely impacted performance in the June quarter when sales grew by just 2.6% . As such, domestic sales increased by 10-11% year-on-year in the remaining three quarters. Total domestic volume for 2020, increased by 5.7% versus previous year. Contribution from e-commerce to domestic sales has increased to 3.7% in 2020 from 0.6% in 2016. Further, the rate of new launches is encouraging. Over the last five years, the company has launched more than 80 new products, out of which, ten were in 2020. Analysts from Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said, “The pace of new launches, while lower than preceding years due to the management’s focus on the core, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, was still healthy compared to peers."" The brokerage firm added, “NWC (net working capital) days worsened from negative three days in CY19 to nil days in CY20 and by four days on a year-end basis from negative two days to two days, with inventory days increasing slightly."" Analysts from Dolat Capital Market Pvt. Ltd said in a report on 16 April, “Nestle India has been rapidly enhancing its distribution reach with a total reach of 4 million outlets in 2016 to 4.7 million outlets in 2020. Direct reach constitutes 30% of total distribution reach."" In its annual report, Nestle said, “From 2005 to 2020, for every ton of production, your Company reduced the usage of energy by around 48%, water usage by around 52%, generation of wastewater by around 55% and reduction in specific direct GHG emissions by 53%."" The company plans to invest ₹2600 crore over the next three-four years to augment its existing manufacturing capacities. To be sure, the expensive valuations of Nestle India shares suggest investors are capturing a good portion of the optimism into the price. “Valuations are expensive at 59 times CY22 estimated earnings per share, thus, preventing us from turning constructive on the stock,"" point out Motilal Oswal analysts in a report on 16 April. According to Dolat Capital, “We remain optimistic on Nestle’s performance due to its strong supply chain, distribution initiatives, new innovative launches and focused marketing campaigns. However, two thirds of Nestle’s business comes from urban. Hence, Out of Home category remains a concern due to new localized lockdowns restricting mobility.""

Updated: 03 Apr 2021,"Packaged, healthy foods to remain in favour post-covid: Report",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/packaged-healthy-foods-to-remain-in-favour-post-covid-report-11617427305335.html,"New Delhi: The covid-19 pandemic has brought about long-lasting shifts in consumer behaviour, including greater adoption of packaged and healthy foods among Indian households, according to a research note by ICICI Securities. Analysts have been carefully watching the market and looking for trends that are likely to stick around and those that are likely to abate as the intensity of the pandemic recedes. Analysts at ICICI Securities, in their note released Friday, identified consumer shift towards healthy foods as well as natural and organic products as emerging, and possibly, long-term trends. This gives packaged food and beverage companies opportunities to expand their portfolios to cater to these demands. “We believe that one of the biggest consumer behaviour shifts during the first lockdown has been accelerated adoption of packaged and healthy foods. Consumers have started to realise that the only way to stay safe during the pandemic is improve their immunity and take care of themselves and have started looking into the labelling of products to understand what is good for them and what is not,"" it said in its note. “We believe that this trend will continue and has been just accelerated due to the pandemic,"" it said in the note on the consumer staples and discretionary sector. Researchers such as Nielsen also pointed to the trend of Indians turning to immunity building foods and beverages in the early days of covid cases being reported in the country. As a result, sales of honey, turmeric and the likes went up. Moreover, companies are also packing in ingredients perceived to be healthy as consumers become more watchful of what they consume amid heightened concerns around their health and immunity. Mint had earlier reported that several large companies such as Nestle India, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Marcio, Dabur India among others were raising the stakes in the health foods category and even relooking at their food portfolio to better suit consumer demand in a post-covid world. The note also points to an increased adoption of ayurvedic, organic and natural products. “We believe that consumers had started shifting to products which are positioned as ayurvedic, organic and naturals. Increased fear of coronavirus will further accelerate such shift as ayurvedic, organic and natural products are perceived as a better alternative to other FMCG products (some of them) are perceived as chemical-based having harmful effects,"" analysts at ICICI Securities said."
Updated: 11 Mar 2021,FMCG cos hike prices to safeguard margins,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/fmcg-firms-grapple-with-rising-inflationary-pressures-11615379079494.html,"NEW DELHI : Packaged consumer goods companies have either raised prices of products such as detergents, soaps, creams, toothpaste, edible oils and tea or are planning to do so to offset rising costs of key raw materials. Rising prices of crude, palm oil and tea and robust demand growth of consumer goods have emboldened the companies to effect moderate price hikes. Palm fatty acid distillate, a chemical used in all home and personal products, has surged 36% in the past 12 months. Freight and packaging costs have also shot up. Also Read | The churn is on at the Kota factory Still, companies are wary that passing on the full impact of the increase in input prices to consumers may throw the nascent demand recovery off course. Analysts, however, warned that companies may have to raise prices further to maintain operating margins.  “Packaged food brands using palm oil as a key raw material require a 3-16% price hike while companies in home and personal care need around 3-13% price rise to sustain margin at current levels,"" Sagarika Mukherjee, an analyst at Elara Capital, said in an 8 March note to clients. Dabur India Ltd said it may consider “selective and judicious"" price hikes in its portfolio while undertaking cost efficiencies. “Recent months have seen inflation inching up for some key raw materials. Besides, the rise in fuel prices would certainly add to the inflationary pressures. We are working towards managing the impact through our synergies and cost efficiencies. However, we may consider undertaking only selective and judicious price hikes, which will also depend on the competitive scenario in the market, to protect our margins,"" said chief financial officer Lalit Malik. The company sells hair oils, juices, shampoos and over-the-counter products. Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting, which makes the Santoor brand of soaps, took an 8% hike in its soap portfolio over the past 3-4 months. “Palm oil prices have gone up dramatically, which is a key ingredient as far as soaps are concerned, and you’d have seen everybody’s announced price hikes in soaps. Even for Chandrika, which we make from coconut oil, we’ve taken a price hike. The price hikes have been to the tune of 8% in the past 3-4 months,"" Vineet Agrawal, chief executive of Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting and executive director, Wipro Enterprises, said in a media roundtable earlier this month. Elara tracked price hikes taken by top FMCG firms in February. Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) hiked prices in its mass-market detergent brand Wheel to the tune of 14-17% quarter-on-quarter and on select detergent bars; there is no price change in premium laundry brands. In its December quarter earnings call, HUL said it is seeing inflation in certain categories such as skin cleansing and tea. On its skin cleansing portfolio—that includes brands such as Lux and Lifebuoy—the company raised prices in that portfolio by about 2.5%, its management said in a post earnings call. Marico Ltd has raised prices by 7% in large stock-keeping units of its Nihar Shanti Amla hair oil, apart from withdrawing in select Parachute packs offered in the third quarter. In edible oil, Marico has raised prices by 5-8% quarter-on-quarter across SKUs to offset sharp inflation in vegetable oil. Marico Ltd did not respond to queries. For companies that sell snacks at ₹5, ₹10 and ₹20 price points, absorbing the costs is the only route available. “What we are trying to do is whichever category has a very sensitive price point, we are trying to lower grammage or trying to rationalize channel margins and then absorb as much as possible. We are also working on new productivity measures wherever possible,"" said Subhashish Basu, chief operating officer of Prataap Snacks. Demand for fast-moving consumer products improved in the December quarter but was down 2% in 2020, market researcher Nielsen said in its quarterly estimates. RSH Global that makes Joy branded personal care products said it is contemplating price hikes if costs don’t stabilize in three months. “Most of the materials we use have seen somewhere between 13% and 15% hike in prices, compared to about 3-4% increase in prices that we have seen in the past,"" said Sunil Agarwal, chairman, RSH Global. “We will be keeping prices constant if the costs settle at expected levels within the next 3 months; else, we will be compelled to increase prices,"" he said"

Prepared dishes and cooking aids rose11.4% and contributed 30% of sales. Performance of this segment was below expected for some analysts. ""Though the 11.4% growth in prepared dishes (Maggi) in CY20 was healthy, it was lower than our earlier estimate due to in-home consumption getting a boost during covid. Performance was likely affected by a slower resumption in manufacturing as Nestlé does not outsource production,"" said analysts from Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd in a report on 27 February. Meanwhile, analysts have a positive view on the company’s capex plans. “Recent capex increase (Rs2600 crore planned over CY20-23 which is equal to the cumulative capex of CY12-19) also points to a strong growth trajectory – first phase to be commissioned by CY2021-end,"" pointed out ICICI Securities Ltd in a report on 27 February. The broking firm added, “Our primary research indicated likely lower birth rates in CY21, a potential headwind for the infant nutrition segment."" To be sure, valuations of Nestle India’s shares are not particularly cheap. The stock trades at about 58 times CY22 Jefferies’ earnings per share estimates."
Updated: 26 Feb 2021,India’s consumption story intact: Narayanan,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/indias-consumption-story-intact-nestle-india-cmd-11614342378079.html,"India’s emerging class of aspiring and affluent citizens will sustain its long-term consumption story as they shift to branded products, despite the setback from the coronavirus outbreak in 2020, Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director, Nestlé India Ltd said on Friday. Consumers moving up the income ladder are likely to demand more and better-quality branded goods and digital connectivity is likely to drive consumption trends in India, Narayanan said. “There has been a lot of moaning and groaning as far as the economy is concerned…But I’m a firm believer in the consumption story of this country. If you look at any research that has been done, the packaged goods market is clearly set to double in the next five to 10 years,"" Narayanan told reporters. Also Read | The limits to India’s privatization push “I think there are a few things that are happening. The market today is worth about $35 billion. They are expecting it to go to $70 billion. The question is, because of the pandemic there could be some delay in that, but I don’t think we will be denied that. There are a few demographic and economic reasons why that would probably be the case,"" he said. Citing research, Narayanan said the shift across consumption classes over the course of this decade will be highly favourable for consumer goods companies. “If you look at what is called the aspiring class, the affordable class, and the wealthy in the country, research after research shows that between 2018-19 and, let’s say, 2030, we are going to be adding almost 140 million households to the aspiring and to the affluent class in this country,"" he said. The bottom of the pyramid in India is going to shrink, Narayanan said. “This clearly means that there is going to be an increasing proclivity towards the consumption of packaged goods and also of branded goods of whatever kind during this period,"" he said. The future workforce of Gen-Z will be 25-20% of the population and this will have a long-lasting impact on future consumption trends, Narayanan said. Moreover, for legacy companies, a fast-growing internet-savvy population is also a key monitorable as it reshapes the way they reach younger consumers. “If you look at the total people on the internet, it is 600-630 million and is expected to grow to about a billion people,"" he said. These economic, demographic, and digital forces are likely to bode well for the consumer goods space, Narayanan said. Last year, Nestlé India said it will invest ₹2,600 crore over three-to-four years to expand manufacturing capacity as it expects demand for packaged foods to go up. Nestlé India reported domestic revenue growth of 10% in the December quarter. The company’s staff costs were up 150 bps during the period. It could take one or two more quarters for urban demand to return to normalcy, Narayanan said. The maker of Maggi noodles and KitKat chocolates, meanwhile, is aggressively pushing its packaged foods in India’s small villages from where it draws a fourth of its sales, much lower than its peers. It plans to expand its reach to 120,000 villages by the end of 2024. “Urban India is extremely important to all companies. A third of our business clearly comes out of the large cities and metros. I think they have been badly afflicted because of the conditions of the lockdown and also because of the migration that took place in the early part and that will gradually start to come back as enterprises open up… On that premise, I think, urban markets also will start to come back in the next one or two quarters,"" he said. Rural and semi-urban India are likely to be more resilient over a period of time with growth in rural outpacing urban markets for the next few quarters, Narayanan said. For Nestlé, urban sales grew 6% in the December quarter, while growth in rural sales was nearly double of that."

Last week, Marico had said it will enter the instant noodles category through the launch of Saffola Oodles. “It’s an interesting launch,"" said an analyst requesting anonymity. “Although Nestle India Ltd’s dominance in noodles makes it difficult for other companies to make a mark in this category,"" he added. Also Read | How to make India’s bad bank workable For Marico, however, the move should fetch some additional revenues. Needless to say, if at-home consumption remains healthy, that would support growth. In its December quarter information update, Marico had said, “The company will continue to innovate and broaden its play in the foods category and is poised to reach the Rs450-500 crore mark by FY22."" ICICI Securities Ltd believes that Marico's (now) aggressive and (somewhat) scale-oriented approach in food segment can lead to revenues of Rs800-1,000 crore by FY25. The broking firm in a report on 19 February, added that, “Instant noodles is an about Rs6,000 crore category where we believe Marico intends to participate in the premium-end, which is about 10% of the category. Let's say, if it achieves a 20% share in this segment, it will reach its objective of Rs100 crore revenue from this new business line."" To be sure, on an overall basis, Marico appears to be on a steady footing, moving ahead. Its December quarter volume performance was good. The company saw 15% volume growth in its India business last quarter. Note that this was the second consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth. Consolidated gross profit margin contracted 223 basis points year-on-year, due to higher input prices, especially of copra and rice bran. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. In its Q3FY21 information update, Marico had said it is witnessing early signs of copra prices cooling off and expects copra prices to be flat in FY22 on an annualized basis. Meanwhile, Marico’s shares now trade at about 42 times estimated earnings for financial year 2022, based on Bloomberg data. “A few more quarters of sustained healthy performance could drive further rerating of the stock, in our view,"" said analysts from JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd in their December quarter review report on 27 January."

On Tuesday, ET Now reported that Tata group will buy 68% stake in BigBasket. The deal ties in with Tata group’s plans to launch a super-app housing all its consumer facing businesses. Also Read | Life lessons from Covidian era startups India’s grocery market has remained an attractive proposition for several large global as well as homegrown retailers for years. It's easy to see why. The bulk of the market is still unorganized with small mom-and-pop stores controlling more than 88% of the trade. New and emerging business models such as JioMart and hyper-local delivery services are now bound to shape the future of grocery and FMCG sales in India, especially as the covidpandemic has pushed consumers to buy more goods online. Companies such as Hindustan Unilever, Nestle India, Marico, Dabur India reported strong growth in sales via e-commerce in their December quarter earnings. Sales via e-commerce already contribute 7.5% to revenues of FMCG companies in the large cities. Overall, the share of e-commerce to FMCG sales rests at 2.8%, market researcher Nielsen IQ said in a recent report. Action is already heating up. Earlier this month, Amazon India said it is integrating its 'Pantry' and 'Fresh' services in cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad and Mysore, to offer a simplified grocery shopping experience. It promises a wide selection of daily grocery offerings across perishables, staples, and household products available for delivery in two hours. FMCG companies are ready to capitalize on this shift. In its third quarter earnings call, FMCG company Dabur India’s top management said that e-commerce is structurally set to become a bigger channel. “The behaviour is currently skewed towards urban and millennial consumers,"" said Mohit Malhotra, chief executive, Dabur India. Malhotra said e-commerce will also compliment modern trade and have a rub-off effect on large stores as retailers such as DMart and Reliance Retail enhance their delivery services and online capabilities."

Expenses for the quarter were up 8.26% to ₹2,793 crore.  “Total sales and domestic sales for the quarter increased by 9.2% and 10.1%, respectively. Domestic sales growth is broad based largely driven by volume and mix. Demand in out-of-home channel further improved in the quarter, but continues to be impacted by covid. Export sales were lower by 7.7% due to lower coffee exports,"" the company added. High employee costs partially negated strong gross margins, said Abneesh Roy, executive vice president, Edelweiss Securities. Employee costs were up 25% during Q3.

Fast moving consumer goods firm Nestle India, for instance, targeted two different consumer segments for its brand Maggi through a massive 'Cooking made simple recipe' campaign during lockdown. Promoted across Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, the campaign targeted both mothers and budding cooks. ""..therefore a digital strategy, which is consumer centric, allowed us to use split audiences and have customised content for each of the cohort. While we did content for mothers with expert advice on replicating restaurant like food at home; for young consumers the content was aimed at addressing basic concerns such as 'how do I chop onions without making my eyes water',"" said Nikhil Chand, director, foods and confectionery at Nestle India. L'Oreal India said that the company is focussing on artificial intelligence (AI) backed diagnostic services for customers where they can get a personalised skin and hair care services specifically designed for them. The beauty firm already offers a hair care service, under its brand Kerastase, under which a customer can get a digital hair health check up in a salon and track the progress online. ""Personalisation is going to be extremely big. In the next few weeks, we will also be launching a service called 'Skin Genius' for L'Oreal Paris in India. This tool will help analyse a customers skin type and corresponding issues before recommending a customised regimen to be followed. We already offer virtual try ons for lipstick, eye shadows and hair colour which has seen traction especially after covid due to social distancing. We believe AI, virtual reality (VR) and vvoice are the future of beauty experience,"" said Amit Jain, managing director, L'Oreal India. Facebook (with over 300 million users) and Instagram (with over 117 million monthly active users) along with Google offer tools for brands to segment their userbase on the basis of demographic, purchase intent and age. ""We know that acceleration in the adoption in the digital is one trend which will continue in a post covid world. Half a billion Indians are now on digital and segmentation has become a possibility for brands because of digital. Brands can slice their consumers on basis of number of variables from demographic to even first time buyer perspective,"" said Sandeep Bhushan, head of global marketing solutions, Facebook India. Marketers also spoke about increasing dependence on influencer marketing which has become the go to strategy of brands especially after pandemic where customers are heavily relying on online recommendations. L'Oreal India, for instance, works with a wide variety of beauty influencers across its brands. ""..however I must add that it is extremely important for brands to do invest in due diligence before onboarding influencers as It is important for the brand to match its value with the influencers and forge long term associations. Data and measurement are equally important to gauge whether the influencer engagement is providing the right RoI,"" noted L'Oreal India's Jain. Pre-covid, Indians spent roughly 3 hours and 22 minutes on their smartphones per day which increased to 3 hours 54 minutes in the phase two of the lockdown, that is, mid-April to early May, according to the findings of a July report by television viewership monitoring agency BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council) and data measurement firm Nielsen that tracked TV viewership and smartphone usage during the various phases of India’s lockdown. Though it cooled off to 3 hours 37 minutes closer to phase two of the country’s unlock, data consumption moved up from 1.08 gb per day per user between the week of the first lockdown to 1.12 GB in end June."

Firms such as Nestle, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Marico, and ITC are taking their cues from such shifts and planning their future products for the Indian market. Also read: India can’t make up its mind on PSUs, 30 years after liberalisation Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director, Nestle India told Mint that two overarching themes that have emerged among consumers as a result the pandemic are: products with better nutrition and products with better immunity for the entire family. “These will be important themes post-pandemic. They were there before—I think people were conscious but I think it was only, say, the younger generation who were worried about health as a denomination…today it is hitting homes hard."" Consequently, the maker of Maggi noodles and Kit Kat chocolates is tweaking its innovation platform. “Their original pre-pandemic intentions were different in some of the categories and now they have become different in the post pandemic reality of what consumers are seeking. You will see these being rolled out systematically in the coming months as part of the (company’s) innovation program,"" Narayanan said. Narayanan added that the company will also look at products around immunity as well as ""the overall area of convenience and food enjoyment"", he said. The urban Indian consumer’s pivot towards healthier packaged foods isn’t new. In fact, several companies have pledged to cut back on salt and sugar have launched more fortified products. But the anxiety around covid-19 is driving more consumers to seek nutrition in food with companies committing to changed portfolios. Hindustan Unilever Ltd. recently pledged to improved nutritional content of its packaged foods in line with the company’s parent, Unilever’s, “Future Foods"" initiative, that promises to aid consumer transition towards healthier diets. While, HUL has been cutting back on sugar and salt content across its food portfolio for a while, the company will double the number of products that deliver nutrition. Recently, it re-launched its Horlicks Protein Plus, an adult nutrition brand and introduced peanut butter under Kissan brand that aims to develop a market beyond nutrition enthusiasts. “Even if the initial anxiety of covid passes, I have a feeling that consumers will become more health conscious… So, I do think, and I hope in any case that post covid, Indian diet takes a turn for the healthier, ""Sudhir Sitapati, executive director, foods and refreshment told Mint in an earlier interview. Snacking and beverages account for 30% to sales of fast-moving consumer goods, according to Nielsen. A recent report by market researcher Mintel said that the persistence of covid-19 has put the spotlight on how consumers’ dietary and lifestyle choices matter. Its Global COVID-19 Tracker for November reflected consumer focus on preventive health care and mindful eating, indicating the potential for disruption in the food and drink space. “Global research today points to the consumers’ increasing demand for products and services that focus on health, wellness, safety and hygiene. Consumers continue to prefer trusted brands. This trend is likely to continue in the ‘next normal’,"" Hemant Malik, Divisional Chief Executive, Foods Division, ITC Ltd said. ITC has launched a B-Natural Plus range of Immunity beverages, Aashirvaad Svasti Fortified milk and ghee, Sunfeast Digestive Veda Marie (with the goodness of ayurveda) and other products. Malik said that while ITC has invested in developing advanced scientific platforms in health, hygiene and immunity in recent times, the company accelerated response to the pandemic across these categories. Marico Ltd's range of ayurveda products made its debut via Saffola ImmuniVeda which had turmeric milk and a kadha mix. Dabur India launched more immunity boosters such as Tusi and Haldi drops. Even as shoppers scout for more immunity-boosting and healthy products, companies said taste still remains paramount. ""Given the unprecedented times, health and hygiene has become very important for our consumers and they are looking up to their trusted snacking brands for nourishment and wellbeing. However, taste continues to remain an important factor for our consumers, as they choose snacks to create eat experiences with their families, at home,"" said Deepak Iyer, Managing Director, Mondelez India. The company, said Iyer, has over time increased its ‘better for you’ product offering with launches like Cadbury Dairy Milk with 30% less sugar and Bournvita biscuits."
Updated: 18 Nov 2020,Rural sales put urban in the shade for Nestlé,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/nestle-india-sees-12-growth-in-rural-markets-in-september-quarter-11605698182712.html,"Large-scale migration and a good monsoon helped Nestlé India’s brands clock strong sales in rural markets and smaller towns as more and new consumers bought more of its Maggi noodles and chocolates in the September quarter, said the company which draws significant business from urban markets. Roughly 20-25% of sales for the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firm comes from India’s villages. In comparision, the FMCG industry sees 36% of sales emerging from rural markets. In the past few years, the company has doubled outreach points by setting up wholesale hubs. It also tweaked its portfolio in line with consumer purchase patterns in smaller towns and villages in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak. In the September quarter, urban growth for Nestlé India stood at 6%, while rural markets grew at 12%. “In Q1, urban growth surpassed rural quite significantly. In Q2 (June quarter), the situation changed. For Nestlé, the urban growth was 0.7%, and rural growth was 1.7%. In Q3, the urban growth for Nestlé was close to 6% and rural growth was upwards of 12%. Whether this will last, and to what extent would the monsoon effect and other measures that the government is taking in order to alleviate the rural sector will be sustainable in terms of long-term demand... only time will tell. However, at least the rural sector continues to be strong and robust for many consumer goods companies,"" Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director, Nestlé India, said at a virtual press conference on Wednesday. The local arm of the Swiss foods company has also doubled its rural reach over the past 12-18 months from 40,000 to 45,000 last year to 90,000 now. The company is also reaping the benefits of a cluster approach it adopted in 2018, by dividing India into 15 different clusters, each considered a different market based on food preferences of the local consumers, Narayanan said. “The 15 clusters that we have got has helped us accelerate some of the distribution touchpoints as well,"" he said. Nestlé India also strengthened its distribution network. Earlier, distributors and re-distributors comprised 5,000 to 6,000 contact points. “Today, we have almost doubled it and now have what are called wholesale hubs in addition to distributors and re-distributors, which are auxiliary points in smaller towns, to enhance the geographic reach of distribution,"" Narayanan said. Nestlé India is not alone in reporting an increase in rural and small-town demand. Most large FMCG firms have seen increased consumption in these parts of the country as better economic prospects and limited reach of the covid-19 accelerated demand. Consumers going back to villages are seeking Nestlé’s brands, driving demand for Maggi, Munch and Nescafe products, Narayanan said. “The number of consumers shifting from urban to rural have increased, leading to a shift of consumption,"" he said. Late last month, Nestlé had announced an investment of ₹2,600 crore that could help the company augment capacity by 10-20% over the next few years."
