Updated: 09 Jul 2022,TCS Q1 profit misses estimates on costs,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/tcs-q1-profit-misses-estimates-on-costs-11657301814159.html,"Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) reported a 5.2% rise in quarterly profit from a year earlier, missing analysts’ estimate, as rising employee costs squeezed earnings even as demand remained robust. The Mumbai-based company’s net profit rose to ₹9,478 crore in the quarter ended 30 June from ₹9,008 crore in the year ago. However, that trailed the ₹9,907 crore consensus profit estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Revenue for the June quarter grew 16.2% from a year ago to ₹52,758 crore on the back of broad-based growth, in line with the consensus Bloomberg estimate of ₹52,491 crore. “We are starting the new fiscal on a strong note, with all-round growth and strong deal wins across all our segments. Pipeline velocity and deal closures continue to be strong, but we remain vigilant given the macro-level uncertainties. Looking ahead, we remain confident in the resilience of technology spending and the secular tailwinds driving our growth,"" said Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive officer and managing director of TCS. The macro-level uncertainties that Gopinathan refers to relate to possible recessions in the US and Europe, where central banks are raising interest rates aggressively to tame red-hot inflation. Indian software services companies, which generate more than 90% of their revenues from these regions, may see sharp cuts in IT spending by clients located in these nations if the rate hikes tips their economies into a recession. If clients indeed scale back spending, it will come after two pandemic years of robust demand for digital and cloud computing services as companies scrambled to digitize their operations. Some analysts fear peak revenue growth for IT services companies is likely behind them, and the momentum is expected to start softening from the second half of the fiscal year because of fewer large deals and clients postponing spending. In addition, margins are under pressure due to wage hikes, higher hiring costs, and increased travel, visa, and other discretionary expenses. However, researcher Gartner expects IT spending to remain strong in the second half of the calendar year. “Gartner projects that overall IT services spending will grow at 6.2% in 2022. Despite the macroeconomic uncertainties, Gartner believes that overall IT demand will remain robust for the second half of 2022,"" said Naveen Mishra, senior director analyst at Gartner. TCS’s operating margin contracted to 23.1% from 25.5% in the year-ago period due to “annual salary increase, the elevated cost of managing the talent churn, and gradually normalizing travel expenses,"" said Samir Seksaria, chief financial officer, TCS. He told reporters that TCS would use better workforce utilization, growth, and other operational efficiencies to get back to the optimum level of margins. The dollar revenue for the June quarter grew 15.5% in constant currency terms from a year earlier to $6.8 billion amid an order book worth $8.2 billion. In terms of industries, growth was led by retail and consumer packaged goods (25.1%), followed by communications and media (19.6%), manufacturing (16.4%), and technology and services (16.4%). The banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector, the largest vertical for TCS, grew 13.9%, while life sciences and healthcare grew 11.9%. Analysts believe TCS is likely to be one of the key beneficiaries of the medium-term uptrend in technology spending. “We expect TCS to gain market share on the back of vendor consolidation and captive monetization efforts. However, moderation in Ebit margin and lower order book would reduce the pace of earnings growth going ahead and may lead to a downward revision to valuation multiple,"" said Mitul Shah, head of research at Reliance Securities. On a trailing 12-month basis, the attrition rate increased to 19.7% in the June quarter from 8.6% in the year-ago period, indicating a growing demand for tech talent in the industry, especially in digital skills. The company added 14,136 employees during the quarter, taking the total headcount to 606,331. TCS declared its earnings after the end of trading on Friday. Ahead of its results, the shares fell 0.67% to ₹3,264.85 on BSE."

Updated: 24 Jun 2022,"Top largecap, midcap, smallcap Indian IT stock picks as suggested by brokerages",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/stocks-to-buy-here-are-top-largecap-midcap-smallcap-indian-it-stock-picks-recommended-by-brokerages-11656063308791.html,"Indian IT stocks have recently been under pressure amid the current market selloff. Recession fears leading to possible reductions in IT spending by clients has also dampened the sentiment of the investors. Recently, various global brokerage and research firms have downgraded Indian IT sector, and also trimmed earnings estimates for FY23. Domestic brokerage and research firm Edelweiss in its latest report on IT said that it prefers HCL Tech, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) among the large-caps and Coforge, LTI and Mindtree among midcap IT stocks. Among small caps, it prefers Zensar Tech, Birlasoft and Firstsource Solutions. Accenture’s strong performance and solid commentary supports brokerage Edelweiss' thesis of a robust tech upcycle. “Its outsourcing growth remains high and bookings also remain strong, which bodes well for Indian IT services companies,"" it said in a note. Analysts at brokerage JM Financial said that Accenture’s results confirm the ‘All’s well for now’ thesis for Indian techs despite increasing concerns of hit on IT spending given a weak macro set up. “Our channel checks also suggest that demand is holding up well for Indian techs for now with the likely macro set up expected to benefit offshore techs, albeit with a lag."" Infosys and HCL Tech are the brokerage's top stock picks amongst Tier I techs, while Mphasis, Persistent Systems amongst Tier II ‘s and Zen Tech and Firstsource amongst small caps. “While supply-side challenges remain a point of concern, with elevated attrition and lower headcount addition, Accenture's margin guidance implies a stable margin performance in FY23. While strong revenue growth and commentary on the pipeline is positive for the IT Services sector, weak employee addition (lowest in the last six quarters) and moderation in deal bookings (-13% QoQ) should dampen the demand outlook,"" said another brokerage Motilal Oswal. The brokerage has maintained its positive stance on the IT sector as it expects sustained growth with stable margin. Infosys, HCL Tech, and TCS remain its preferred stock picks within the Tier I IT space.

Updated: 20 Jun 2022,Fired TCS employee gets back his job after 7-year battle,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/fired-tcs-thirumalai-selvan-gets-back-his-job-after-7-year-battle-read-his-story-here-11655717066600.html,"Sacked in 2015, did freelance work as software consultant and a real estate broker, fought  a court case and now 48 year old Thirumalai Selvan can sigh a heave of relief when a Chennai court has ruled that Tata Consultancy Services should pay him his salary and benefits of seven years in full. That's right, the Chennai court ordered TCS to pay Selvan his complete salary for the past seven years and reinstate him into the company.  Read the story here. Thirumalai Selvan had worked for TCS, an information technology company for eight years before he became a victim of the mass layoffs in 2015.  Selvan was asked to leave citing poor performance, wherein the information Technology company said his performance was not up to its expectations. Selvan then approached the court seeking continuity of service. Selvan served on a managerial position in the company. After the layoff, he was forced to look for freelance jobs. As a software consultant and a real estate broker, Selvan managed to earn ₹10,000th per month. His family depended on savings and his wife’s salary. TCS in their argument stated that Selvan was working in a managerial cadre and would not come under the category of ‘workman’. However, C Kumarappan, Principal Labour Court’s presiding officer said, “The reason for not mentioning the petitioner’s other duties is nothing but a subterfuge, to camouflage his principal nature of duty"". The court observed that Selvan’s primary role was that of a skilled worker. Adding to Selvan’s financial troubles were legal hassles. “I would have travelled to the court more than 150 times in the last seven years,"" he told DT Next. After spending seven years, the Chennai court ruled in his favour. It refuted TCS’ argument that Selvan belonged to the managerial cadre and was not a workman -- someone with a specified skill. The Forum for IT Employees (FITE), that helped Selvan in his court case, celebrated the judgement. “Justice anywhere is hope everywhere and a reminder to all who are forcing employees to resign,"" the group was quoted as saying by the Federal website. “Great work done by Team FITE Chennai and salute to the TCS employee who fought for justice."" A mechanical engineer by graduation, Selvan worked in his core sector for four years before switching to the software lane in 2001. He became a part of TCS as an assistant systems engineer in 2006. Meanwhile, share of the top Indian IT company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) have fallen sharply amid the current market volatility and the IT stocks are trading near their respective 52-week low levels. TCS shares are down about 18% in 2022 so far whereas that of Infosys have fallen more than 25% during the same period.  "

Updated: 09 Jun 2022,Telcos and tech cos at loggerheads on 5G private networks,https://www.livemint.com/industry/telecom/telcos-and-tech-cos-at-loggerheads-on-5g-private-networks-11654767817399.html,"NEW DELHI: Indian telecom operators and the Broadband India Forum (BIF) are at loggerheads over the issue of private entities being allowed to set up captive networks with direct allotment of 5G spectrum. The Forum, comprising members such as Tata Consultancy Services, Amazon, and Meta, among others, has said that private networks are revenue generators for the government and giving out 5G spectrum to set up private networks does not pose a security threat as the networks are closed and disconnected from public telecom networks. In a position paper, Broadband India Forum has emphasised that the government should have a forward-looking approach towards use and advancement of technology, while asking the Centre to earmark certain amount of exclusive spectrum for private 5G networks in each type of spectrum band. “Allow direct allocation of spectrum to enterprises/organisations at nominal administrative fee, as per global best practices,"" it said. “Facilitate a light-touch online portal based paperless regime for acquiring permission/license for ‘Captive Wireless Private Network (CWPN)’ within 30 days of application, (as recommended by Trai) to enable ease of doing business,"" the body led by technology companies has said. It has argued that private 5G networks were best set up by enterprises since public networks cannot deliver the levels of efficiencies required. It added that such networks would make for additional revenue streams for telcos and the government, since they will purchase the spectrum at a price fixed by the government and allocated administratively. The Forum noted that the perception that spectrum can be assigned only through auction is grossly inaccurate and misleading, referring to the Supreme Court guidelines on spectrum allocation issued in 2012. It also said that private 5G networks were not allowed for external communications and the need for lawful monitoring, interceptions and the possibility of threats to national security do not arise at all. Indian telcos, on the other hand, have written to the government against direct allocation of 5G airwaves to private companies as it will adversely impact the enterprise businesses of telecom companies and will leave no business case for the carriers to roll out 5G services. In a communication to telecom minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) which represents Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, has sought the government’s “urgent intervention"" to protect the interest of telcos. The association said giving away dedicated spectrum for private captive networks will hurt the financial health of the industry which is on the path of revival after the government’s relief package last year. “We request your urgent kind intervention in the matter so as to ensure that the interest of the TSPs as well the enterprise segment is efficiently catered to,"" the association said in a letter to the minister on Thursday. This comes in response to private companies such as Tata Consultancy Services seeking direct allocation of 5G spectrum, following recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) that had left it to the government to either license out the airwaves directly or through a leasing model via existing telcos. The telecom department has taken an internal view that telcos were best suited to provide the services to private companies, however a final decision on the matter is yet to be taken. The association had on Wednesday said in a position paper that there was no justification for allocating radiowaves directly to enterprises for operating private captive networks, and that licensed telecom companies are fully capable of providing all customised solutions in the most competitive and economic manner. “If independent entities set up private captive networks with direct 5G spectrum allotment by DoT, the business case of TSPs (telecom service providers) will get severely degraded... This will diminish the revenue so much that there will be no viable business case left for the TSPs and there will not remain any need for 5G Networks rollout by TSPs,"" the association said in the letter to the ministry sent on Thursday. “If private captive networks for enterprises are set up independently by other entities then this would mean dramatically altering the industry dynamics and hurting the financial health of the industry and will strike at the very heart of the business case,"" it further stated. The association has said that worldwide, statistically, wherever 5G has been rolled out, any consequent revenue increment has not come from the retail segment but rather only from the enterprise segment. It also argued that revenues of telcos are not going to increase from the retail segment despite very heavy capital investments for rollout of 5G networks, which will get accentuated further because of the high price-sensitivity of the market. “The new segment that would be benefitted by 5G services of the TSPs is the enterprise segment including manufacturing, logistics, education, hospitals, campuses, factories, etc. Our TSP members have also conducted successful 5G trials for many of these use cases in the last one year,"" the association said, noting that with 5G auctions, telcos were targeting the enterprise segment for revenue enhancement."

Updated: 19 May 2022,No-code bot platform E42 launches marketplace for businesses to hire AI employee,https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/nocode-bot-platform-e42-launches-marketplace-for-businesses-to-hire-ai-employee-11652957618284.html," New Delhi: Indian artificial intelligence (AI) bot platform, E42, which specializes in developing no-code, automated AI bots for various services, has launched a marketplace to help businesses hire such bots. The marketplace will be a store for E42’s own clients to put up their own AI bots, which can then be licensed or hired by other businesses to deploy on their own services. Animesh Samuel, co-founder and chief executive of E42, told Mint that the platform’s bots, which he refers to as “AI workers"", are more developed and complicated than just chatbots. The latter are services deployed across various websites to automate customer queries, in a bid to augment human-driven customer services. Samuel said that while E42’s AI workers include chatbots, they are more advanced in terms of the tasks that they can execute. These “complicated"" tasks include AI bots that can automate the workflow of a company’s human resources and accounts departments – and also work as an analyst by processing data. E42 so far has about 20 clients, which include the likes of Tata Consultancy Services, Hindalco and Mahindra & Mahindra. Samuel said these clients, which have used E42’s AI platform to build their bots, can now offer the application programming interfaces (APIs) of the developed bots through the newly launched marketplace – from where third party companies can “hire"" them for a fee. The process, according to Samuel, eliminates the need for smaller companies with limited resources to go through the process of developing and deploying their own automated bots – which could be complicated for those without access to ample data to train these services. To be sure, the E42 marketplace is not the only click-to-deploy AI bot marketplace in India. American software firm Automation Anywhere already has a similar AI bot store, which offers automation packages developed by the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Microsoft, Google and others. Big tech firms have their own AI automation marketplaces as well. For instance, Amazon has its Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace, which offers services such as Accenture’s Conversational AI Platform as click-to-deploy tools for business. Microsoft, similarly, also has its Azure Marketplace offering similar services. E42’s Samuel added that the question of such AI “workers"" replacing humans in existing jobs is not out of the question. “This moment would be similar to the advent of the personal computer, which replaced a lot of human work such as physical book-keeping in accounts. While some jobs will become obsolete, this will make way for humans to take on more advanced roles, and upskill their profiles,"" he added."
Updated: 18 May 2022,Only a matter of time before TCS doubles its revenues to hit the $50 billion mark: CEO,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/only-a-matter-of-time-before-tcs-doubles-its-revenues-to-hit-the-50-billion-mark-ceo-11652892463072.html,"At the current pace of growth, it is only a matter of time for Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) to double its revenues and hit the $50 billion-mark, chief executive Rajesh Gopinathan said in a letter to shareholders in its annual report FY 2021-22. TCS clocked $25.7 billion in revenues during FY22.  For this to happen, TCS is focusing on two things. “One, we want to arrive at that milestone with a more balanced portfolio, with a much larger proportion of business transformation revenues, so we have two equally strong growth engines for the journey ahead. For this, we want to build on our initial successes in the G&T (growth and transformation) opportunity, and put in place a structured way to deepen existing innovation and transformation engagements, while expanding the number of clients for whom we provide such services,"" Gopinathan said. “Second, as we get larger, we shouldn’t lose sight of what has brought us thus far – our customer centricity.""  TCS is confident that technology spending will continue to grow. “We are amid a multi-year technology upgrade cycle that provides strong, structural growth drivers for the next few years,"" Gopinathan added.  The cloud adoption trends strengthened further in FY22, with more clients embarking on multi-horizon cloud transformation journeys. However, TCS believes there has been a change in mindset. “During the year, enterprises moved from thinking of technology-led innovation as a way of coping with pandemic challenges, to looking at it as a means of powering their growth and transformation, especially in the case of clients who had already moved their most critical workloads to the cloud,"" Gopinathan said.  TCS has recently rolled out a new organization structure with the aim to achieve two imperatives. “It retains the atomicity of our earlier architecture, and its three dimensions – industry verticals, horizontal service lines and geography-based sales. We have now added a fourth dimension, the stage of the customer’s relationship journey with TCS,"" Gopinathan said.  TCS has rearranged the existing units into three business groups, each aligned to a particular phase in the customer relationship journey: the Relationship Incubation Group that will provide the high-touch, high engagement, delivery-focused model that new clients require; the Enterprise Growth Group which pulls together capabilities from across the different service lines to stitch together solutions that address clients’ business needs when the relationship is in its hyper growth phase; and the Business Transformation Group that will manage the largest clients and help them accomplish their growth and transformation objectives.  Commenting on the geo-political tensions in Europe, Gopinathan said that the resultant impact on global economic growth are real threats."

This year on March 31, BSNL placed an order with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to procure equipment for 6,000 radio sites and 400 on 900 MHz frequency bands in both rural and urban areas.

Updated: 22 Apr 2022,"HCL Q4 results decent, but there are risks to FY23 margin outlook",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/hcl-q4-results-decent-but-there-are-risks-to-fy23-margin-outlook-11650613329838.html,"Shares of large-cap IT services provider HCL Technologies Ltd rose 2.5% intraday on the NSE on Friday reacting to its March quarter earnings. Revenue growth in constant currency terms rose 1.1% sequentially largely in-line with expectations. While its IT services business aided revenue growth, the products & platforms business was a drag. The company signed six large services and four product deals across verticals for a total new deal total contract value of $2.3 billion. For FY23, the company has guided for dollar revenue growth of 12-14% in constant currency terms. This is likely to be aided by continued traction in its services business and a healthy deal pipeline. Ebit margin for FY23 is seen in the 18-20% range. Ebit is short for earnings before interest and tax. While HCL’s FY23 margin guidance is pretty much on expected lines, its revenue guidance is ahead of estimates, said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. That said, the domestic brokerage house cautions that even though HCL’s IT services margins will keep on improving, volatility in the products segment will continue. Analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd expect HCL to struggle on margins. They say elevated supply-side issues and a higher investment requirement will result in HCL’s Ebit margin staying at the lower end of its guidance, before recovering in FY24. It should be noted that on a last twelve-month trailing basis, HCL’s IT services attrition rose to 21.9% in Q4FY22 from 19.8% in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, in the last one year, the HCL Technologies stock has risen by 15%. Peers Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd have risen by 16% and 18%, respectively. On the valuations front, analysts at IIFL Securities Ltd note that while the stock is trading at 30% discount to peers, rerating would be contingent on a more consistent delivery on growth and margins."
Updated: 20 Apr 2022,The merger of IT subsidiaries augurs well for L&T,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-merger-of-it-subsidiaries-augurs-well-for-lt-11650438969044.html,"Three years ago, Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) forked out ₹10,800 crore for a hostile buyout of Mindtree Ltd. The Bengaluru-based IT services company will be merged with Larsen and Toubro Infotech (LTI), another listed IT services company of the engineering conglomerate, Bloomberg has reported, citing people familiar with the development. Many observers, including Mint, had said at the time L&T bought Mindtree in the summer of 2019 that its merger with LTI could pose risk, the two being culturally diverse companies; as though marrying a horse-power driven organization with a one that works on brain-power, that too in the mode of startups. And so, that the board of L&T avoided rushing into merging all the IT businesses suggests a careful, calibrated approach. The immediate question that comes to mind concerns L&T Technology Services Ltd, the smallest IT firm but with a larger share of the giant’s products and platforms business. Will it be merged with Mindtree and LTI? Ideally, it should be. L&T owns 74.05% of the shareholding of LTI, the largest of the three IT services companies it owns, while it owns 61% of the shares of Mindtree. L&T owns 73.95% of L&T Technology Services Ltd.               "

This is on a day when the benchmark Nifty50 index was nearly 1% up. The March quarter (Q4FY22) results of the information services (IT) company have fallen short of analysts’ expectations. Q4 revenue of $570.4 million represents 3.6% sequential growth in constant currency (cc) terms. This has missed ICICI Securities' estimate of 5.3% sequential cc growth. The growth was led by CPG (consumer packaged goods), retail & pharma, which reported 7.7% sequential revenue growth in cc terms. In Indian rupee terms, revenue grew by 4% sequentially to Rs4301.6 crore. “We would like to highlight that in LTI also (like Infosys Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd), we have seen softening of BFS (banking and financial services) growth – just 2.8% sequentially versus average of 10% in last 3 quarters,"" said analysts at ICICI Securities in a report on 20 April. Owing to lower working days in Q4 and impact of revenue mix, the Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margins stood at 17.3% which is 60 basis points (bps) drop sequentially. One basis point is one-hundredth of a point. In Q4, the company booked four large deals with net new TCV (total contract value) of over $80 million. The deal pipeline is strong as customers will continue to spend on digital initiatives. In FY23, the management maintained the profit after tax margin guidance of 14-15%. “LTI has impressed with strong growth and rebound in large deal wins in FY22. Our view on the business is unchanged and the company is well positioned to gain market share with its strong business model,"" added the ICICI Securities report. Geographically, North America and Europe clocked 2.5% and 5.8% sequential growth respectively. According to the management, the demand outlook in Europe has not been affected currently. Even so, there could be impact of higher costs and wage inflation. The headcount addition of 2,448 employees in Q4FY22 indicates that the outlook is strong. But attrition (last twelve months) increased to 24% in Q4FY22 from 22.5% in Q3FY22. Margin pressures are likely to remain elevated with high attrition, wage inflation and rising costs. “We cut FY2023-24E earnings per share by 2-3% to account for margin headwinds"" said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a report on 19 April. Note that the broking firm has also reduced the fair value of the stock to Rs5,500 (from Rs6,130 earlier), valuing the stock at 29X FY2024E earnings per share (32X earlier). “We like scalability attributes of LTI’s business but find current valuations expensive,"" it said. The stock is currently trading at Rs5207 apiece on the NSE."
Updated: 11 Apr 2022,TCS Q4 earnings today: Five things to watch out for ,https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/five-things-to-watch-out-for-in-tcs-q4-earnings-today-11649648282584.html,"Bengaluru: India’s largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) will be the first among peers to announce its fourth quarter earnings on Monday. Analysts believe IT companies will continue to post strong growth numbers on account of digital and cloud transformation initiatives with enterprise clients. Tier I companies should deliver revenue growth in a narrow range of 2.8-5.1% sequentially in constant currency, according to Motilal Oswal. While TCS does not provide a formal revenue growth guidance, management commentary on business outlook will be closely monitored. As per consensus estimates by Bloomberg, TCS is expected to post revenues of ₹50,249 crore and net profit of ₹10,077 crore for the March quarter. Mint highlights five things to watch out for in TCS’s Q4 results that will be declared on after market hours on Monday. Revenue growth TCS is expected to register a 3% sequential growth in constant currency led by continued improvement in demand from banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), healthcare, retail, acceleration in digital technologies, and ramp-up of deals, according to ICICI Securities. Further, the brokerage firm said cross-currency headwinds would lead to a revenue growth of 2.7% sequentially in dollar terms. In rupee terms, revenue is expected to increase 3.1% sequentially. EBIT margin Analysts expect margins to come under pressure and either remain flat or decline in Q4 due to supply-side headwinds. For TCS, EBIT margins are expected to decline 20 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 24.8% due to continued increases in employee costs amid high attrition, according to ICICI Securities. Brokerage firm Sharekhan believes EBIT margin is likely to remain flat sequentially. “We believe margin headwinds such as higher hiring expenses to backfill rising attrition, increasing discretionary expenses, and higher-than normal visa expenses will be offset by operating efficiencies and improvement in pyramid balancing. We also believe TCS has strong supply-side capabilities among its peers."" Deal momentum Investors will closely monitor the deal pipeline and momentum for TCS. The IT major’s growth is expected to be driven by higher discretionary spending and digital transformation initiatives. “We expect deal TCVs (total contract value) to remain stable on a sequential basis at around $8 billion in Q4, led by mid-size deals. However, it would decline on y-o-y basis due to lack of any large deals,"" Sharekhan said in an earnings preview. Corporate restructuring There will be keen investor interest in TCS’s corporate restructuring planned for FY23. TCS is expected to unveil a new operational structure with four distinct business groups being created to drive its next phase of growth to touch the next milestone of $50 billion in revenue. This is not the first time TCS is restructuring its business framework. In 2008, the company created 23 smaller units of about $250 million each, a structure that helped boost substantial growth for the company. Management commentary on outlook According to Sharekhan, investors will watch out for the management’s commentary on the overall demand environment; the impact of recent geopolitical tension on technology spending of clients; reasons for the absence of large deal signings; and commentary on the progress of its product and platform portfolio. Besides, investors will also watch out for attrition rates and the demand from across verticals especially BFSI, manufacturing, communication, and retail.    "

Updated: 04 Apr 2022,India-Australia pact resolves IT firms’ double taxation issue,https://www.livemint.com/industry/infotech/indiaaustralia-pact-resolves-it-firms-double-taxation-issue-11649011482878.html,"The India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (IndAus ECTA) inked on Saturday found a resolution to the double taxation issue for Indian information technology (IT) firms, allows duty-free access to Indian wines, and a Work and Holiday arrangement that experts believe will find many takers in India. Also, a negotiation sub-committee between India and Australia will start talks within 75 days to transform the interim pact into a full-fledged comprehensive economic cooperation agreement (CECA), according to the agreement’s text. In a major relief for Indian IT firms such as Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, and HCL Technologies Ltd, Australia has committed to resolving the long-pending double taxation issue that was affecting Indian tech firms operating in the country through amendments in its domestic law over the next few months. The resolution of this issue will happen in line with the implementation of the bilateral economic cooperation and bilateral free trade pact between the two nations and is expected to help Indian IT companies expand operations in Australia. The India-Australia deal is expected to be implemented in four months. According to industry estimates, Indian IT firms lost more than $1 billion in taxes due to existing provisions in the Australia-India double taxation avoidance agreement (DTAA) causing double taxation issues for these companies. Most IT firms take up projects where they do some portion of work on-site, and some from India. However, Australian courts have ruled that even the work done from India can be considered as royalties and be taxed as per local Australian laws. The same income is also taxed in India. “Nasscom has been advocating for this change for a few years and is delighted to see the roadmap for resolution under the ambit of the Australia – India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement,"" said Gagan Sabharwal, senior director at industry body Nasscom. “We will continue to work with both governments and are confident that amendments in the Australian domestic law will be made soon in the upcoming Parliament session to seal this intent,"" added Sabharwal. He said recognising talent mobility with four-year temporary work permits, spouses and dependent visas would enable enterprises in both countries to leverage digital talent skills, build digital capabilities at scale and collaborate through innovative startups. Queries emailed to Infosys, HCL, TCS, and Wipro remained unanswered till press time. While India has agreed to reduce the duty on Australian wines and, in turn, got duty free access on Indian wines, market access for Indian whiskeys and spirits may need to wait longer. The two sides have decided to set up a working group within the next six months of the agreement coming into force to consider market access, maturation rules for whiskey and other issues related to the Indian alcoholic beverage industry. The issue pertains to maturation rules, where Australian laws allow whiskeys and spirits only over two years of maturation. However, the Indian side has been pressing for the removal of this condition, arguing that Indian whiskeys mature faster due to the warmer climate and a two-year maturation rule results in a 10% volume loss due to evaporation. “This historic FTA facilitates better market access for quality Australian wines into India and opens up the Indian wine industry to great opportunities in cross border investment, expertise transfer, collaboration and partnerships… For liquor, where India is a major producer, some regulatory hurdles remain against the export of Indian products to Australia. However, the FTA outlines a roadmap with time frames to resolve such issues, and once it’s done, Indian industry will be a big gainer,"" said Vinod Giri, director general, Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies. Tariffs on Australian wines with a minimum import price of $5 per bottle will be reduced from 150% to 100% on the deal’s implementation and subsequently to 50% over 10 years. Also, duty on bottles with a minimum import price of $15 will be reduced from 150% to 75%, and subsequently to 25% over 10 years. The two sides have also agreed to set up a joint working group on wine for the exchange of information and cooperation on production and trade-related matters on wine. Australia has also agreed to implement a Work and Holiday arrangement with India within two years of the pact coming into effect, granting 1,000 visas, which will allow Indians who are over 18 years and less than 31 to stay in Australia for a year. It will be a multiple entry visa, allowing them to enter and re-enter Australia multiple times, take up paid or unpaid employment for up to six months and undertake study or training for up to four months."

The Mumbai-based company will create four internal teams -- a business transformation group, incubation group, enterprise growth and another aimed at new business models, according to people familiar who didn’t want to be identified as the details are private. TCS is expected to present this proposed new structure at its board meeting this week, said one of the people.  The rejig is aimed at aligning TCS, India’s second-largest company by market value, with the changing needs of its clients who are increasingly looking to digitize in the post-Covid-19 world and the boom in startups. India’s IT services sector has been on a roll, buoyed by the pandemic-induced rush among enterprises to transform into work-from-anywhere, digital businesses, boosting growth and making it a $227 billion industry by end of March. A spokesperson for the company said TCS won’t comment on internal business plans or strategies. Business Journey TCS’s new structure is based on where its customers are in their business journey, the people said. It factors in, for instance, that a sub-$5 billion start-up would have a very different set of technology and business requirements than a large global corporation.  TCS, which employs over half-a-million around the world, the bulk of them in India, reported $25 billion in revenues for the year ended Dec. 31. Riding the sector boom, TCS and its rivals Infosys Ltd. and HCL Technologies have been signing on new customers, expanding contracts and hiring software programmers by the thousands every quarter. The outsourcing giant, part of the Tata Group, is also planning to open a dozen innovation centers globally including the U.S. and Europe, according to one of the people familiar. TCS, however, will need to manage its surging staff costs that partly led to the outsourcer missing analyst estimates on profit last quarter. The company provides a suite of services from cloud to data analytics and infrastructure management to world’s largest companies including Citigroup Inc., General Motors Co., Woolworths Group Ltd. and Petronas Gas Bhd.

Updated: 01 Mar 2022,How big three are commoditizing consulting biz,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/how-big-three-are-commoditizing-consulting-biz-11646155986998.html,"My hypothesis is that MBB (McKinsey, BCG, and Bain) are doing to Indian management consulting what TIW (Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, and Wipro) did to Indian IT—commoditizing the sector but in a good way. In the 1990s, as the Indian information technology sector started maturing, TIW were prominent recruiters in the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). These were sought-after roles, offering 25% yearly increments and the potential to immigrate to the West. TIW acted as finishing schools for Indian engineers and prepared them for the software boom that continues. TIW could do this then because, to borrow a startup term, they were hyper-scaling. US dollar per-hour rates offshore were in the late teens and early twenties, which provided enough margins for the attractive increments and swanky campuses. Things started changing in the mid-2000s. Given their growth, TIW became mass recruiters on their traditional campuses. This loss of exclusivity dampened their appeal. Continued pressures on billing rates, which barely crossed $20 offshore, impacted their ability to pay relatively high salaries. They responded by expanding their recruitment net to the next tier colleges and relied on processes to preserve their margins. This trend continues. Three decades later, offshore billing rates remain in the mid to late twenties. Starting salaries in these companies have hardly doubled in two decades, and their recruiters target a very different profile of colleges. While this may sound negative, this trend has been a massive blessing for India, which just crossed $300 billion in IT services export. This continuous expansion of the recruitment pool has ensured that hundreds of thousands of young engineers have been through these world-class software finishing schools. This has made them globally competitive. Today, many have started their own firms or are top leaders in established IT companies. The standardization of the global delivery model, which allowed this expansion with limited billing increases, is an insurmountable competitive advantage for the Indian IT industry. The Indian management consulting industry is witnessing similar trends. Till the mid-2000s, an offer from MBB was the holy grail in the top business schools. They recruited from just five-six campuses and rarely hired more than 25 consultants combined. Their salaries used to be the highest, and the occasional offer from international offices made front-page news. Today, these firms are mass recruiters in a larger pool of business schools. It is not unusual for MBB to recruit 30 students from every targeted campus. Add to that several similar firms, such as Kearney, Accenture, and Deloitte, which recruit similar numbers. Salaries remain competitive, but technology companies such as Google and VC-funded startups routinely offer higher pay. In fact, product management in startups is competing with consulting as the preferred choice of fresh MBAs. These firms are also haemorrhaging talent. Many find the constant intensity (and travel) of consulting unsustainable. There are multiple opportunities now in funds, startups and corporates that offer competitive pay. These alternatives highly value the MBB training, creating a lucrative exit path for consultants. It is common for consultants joining these firms to have a two–three-year horizon for an exit. It is this talent bleed that caused a once-blue blooded firm to flood LinkedIn, requesting applications in recent weeks. As with IT, this is a very positive trend for India. We will soon have the largest pool of management consultants in the world. Their training is highly valued, and their talents are sought-after. These are the professionals who will drive India’s growth as corporate leaders, startup founders and fund managers. Many of them will leverage their training and relationships to start their consulting firms, which will drive a wave of offshoring of consulting services to India. The influence of this soft power will be massive, perhaps even more than the influence of Indian IT globally. This will also drive down the rates of consulting services, which will make it accessible to a larger pool of clients, not just in the traditional markets but also in emerging economies in Asia and Africa. The resulting virtuous cycle for India-bred global management consulting firms will help attract both clients and capital. Like IT, management consulting in India is commoditizing. This is great for India and the world. Abhisek Mukherjee is co-founder and director of Auctus Advisors."

However, a final resolution could take time, since the existing India-Australia double taxation avoidance agreement (DTAA) may need to be revised. The tax matter, which comes under the finance ministry, is being negotiated alongside ongoing discussions on a free trade agreement. An interim trade deal is expected within 30 days. During his three-day visit to New Delhi last week, Australian trade minister Dan Tehan met finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and discussed the double taxation issue. Under the provisions of the India-Australia DTAA, income generated from offshore software services rendered from India gets taxed as royalty in Australia, while the same income is taxed in India as well.

Share buyback and what it means for investors: Share buyback, or share repurchase, is when a company buys back its own shares from investors or stakeholders. It can be seen as an alternative, tax-efficient way to return money to shareholders. Buybacks are attractive in tax terms even after considering the 10 per cent tax on long term capital gains (LTCG). Usually, companies go for share buyback if it wishes to increase demand in the market. Share buybacks reduce the number of shares in circulation, which can increase the share value and the earnings per share (EPS). When a company buys back shares, it results in a reduction of the number of shares outstanding and the capital base. To that extent, it improves the EPS and the ROE of the company. When the EPS goes up, assuming the P/E remains constant the price of the stock should also go up. Typically, Indian IT companies like Infosys, TCS, Wipro and HCL Tech have a lot of cash and it has a cost. Therefore it is better the cash is returned to shareholders through a buyback."
Updated: 11 Feb 2022,What Chandra’s reappointment means for Tata Sons,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/what-chandra-s-reappointment-means-for-tata-sons-11644594937273.html,"“A safe pair of hands"". That’s how Tata Group veterans describe Natarajan Chandrasekaran, who has just been reappointed for a second five-year term as chairman of Tata Sons, the holding company steering the ₹23 trillion market cap salt-to-software conglomerate. Safety was the paramount driver behind Chandrasekaran’s initial appointment as the first non-Tata family member to head the sprawling, 100-company group. His appointment had just followed the messy and headline-grabbing ouster of Cyrus Mistry as chairman, after a long and bitter boardroom and court battle which saw much washing of dirty Tata linen in public. At the time that he took over as head of Tata Sons, Chandra – as he is universally known – had been arguably the most successful chief executive within the group, having transformed Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) into the world’s 68th most valuable company by market capitalization, and far and away the biggest and most valuable IT services company in India. TCS was also the main group company which was contributing to Tata Sons’ coffers. The group’s large manufacturing enterprises – Tata Steel, Tata Chemicals and Tata Motors – where struggling under a mountain of debt. Other than Titan, its consumer-facing businesses were struggling. The foray into mobile telephony had proved a disaster, Tata Motors had been reduced to a largely taxi brand in the domestic market, the 'world’s cheapest car’ – the Nano – had flopped and its retail forays were being strongly countered by global e-commerce giants as well as deep-pocketed local competitors like Reliance. And its aviation forays – Air Asia India and Vistara -- were stuck with low market share and also, in the case of Air Asia India, mired in controversies over alleged mismanagement and worse.       "
Updated: 12 Feb 2022,N Chandrasekaran reappointed Tata Sons’ Chairman for another 5 years,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/n-chandrasekaran-re-appointed-tata-sons-chairman-for-another-5-years-11644569530150.html,"Tata Sons Pvt Ltd board on Friday considered and approved the re-appointment of its executive chairman N Chandrasekaran for another five years. Ratan Tata, who was a special invitee to the board meeting expressed his satisfaction on the progress and performance of the Tata Group under the leadership of N Chandrasekaran. He recommended his term be renewed for a further five-year period. The continuity in leadership comes as the 154-year-old conglomerate that makes salt to luxury sedans, is working on an all-in-one ecommerce superapp -- one of Chandrasekaran’s key projects -- to market its swathe of consumer products and services as part of a digital makeover. The group is also reinventing its aviation businesses after successfully acquiring Air India Ltd. from the federal government last year. “It has been a privilege to lead the Tata Group for the last five years and I am delighted at the opportunity to lead the Tata Group for another five years, in its next phase,"" Chandrasekaran said. Chandrasekaran's current tenure as the chairman of the company expires at the end of this month. Chandrasekaran joined the board of Tata Sons in 2016 and took over as Chairman in 2017 at a time when the group was mired in crisis after the ouster of his predecessor Cyrus Mistry in a shock boardroom coup led by Ratan Tata, who heads Tata Trusts - a bunch of philanthropic organizations that hold 66% stake in Tata Sons. The ouster triggered a years-long legal battle between the two sides and was finally put to bed after India’s top court ruled in March 2021 that Mistry’s dismissal was legal. Under Chandrasekaran, Tatas sold the mobile phone business of Tata Teleservices to Bharti Airtel in an attempt to cut losses. In May 2018, the group made one of the biggest acquisitions to date when Tata Steel took over Bhushan Steel by paying ₹35,200 crore under the insolvency process. Tata Steel, which managed to turn around the company renamed as Tata Steel BSL, however, couldn't close a deal to sell its European business to ThyssenKrupp. In October last year, Tata Sons made a winning bid for Air India, bringing back an airline that the group had originally founded. The Tata group now has three airlines - Tata SIA Airlines, AirAsia India and Air India with a combined market share of over 25%. Last year, Chandrasekaran started his acquisition spree in the digital domain in his drive to launch a Super App which will sell from salt to airline tickets to the customers directly. In May 2021, Tata Sons acquired Big Basket at a reported valuation of ₹9,500 crore, pitting it in direct competition with American retail giant, Amazon and Wal-Mart owned Flipkart and Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Retail. While Tata Power has been working to unlock the value of its renewables business, Tata Motors stabilised under his leadership. Chandrasekaran also chairs the Boards of several group operating companies, including Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Power, and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) – of which he was Chief Executive Officer from 2009-17. His appointment as Chairman in 2017 followed a 30-year business career at TCS, which he joined from university. Chandra rose through the ranks at TCS to become CEO and Managing Director of the leading global IT solution and consulting firm. Under his leadership, TCS generated total revenues of $16.5 billion in 2015-16 and consolidated its position as the largest private sector employer in India and the country’s most valuable company. TCS has also been placed among the “Big 4"" most valuable IT services brands worldwide, ranked as one of the world’s most innovative companies by Forbes and recognized as a global top employer by the top employers Institute across 24 countries. With 100-odd businesses and 29 listed firms, the Tata group had combined revenue of about $103 billion for the year ended March 31, 2021. Its 800,000-plus employees help the conglomerate make cars and trucks, blend tea, manufacture salt, forge steel, sell insurance, write software, operate airlines and phone networks, among much else.

Updated: 20 Jan 2022,Why L&T Tech’s valuation is a worry after weak Q3,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/lt-tech-stock-slips-7-as-q3-revenue-disappoints-11642567872747.html,"For a mid-cap stock trading at a steep valuation premium to its larger peers, subdued earnings growth could be punished more severely by investors. Case in point is information technology firm L&T Technology Services Ltd (LTTS). The tier-II company’s December quarter (Q3FY22) results didn’t excite the Street as its sequential constant currency revenue growth at 4.2%, was below the 5-5.2% estimates of many analysts. Seasonality, weak performance of its industrial products and medical devices verticals and a high base of Q2FY22 affected LTTS’ revenues.     "
Updated: 17 Jan 2022,"HCL’s Q3 revenue is rosy, but the margin is a sore point",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/hcls-q3-revenue-rosy-but-margin-a-sore-point-11642355277698.html,"HCL Technologies Ltd’s December quarter earnings performance was a mixed bag. Its fastest revenue growth in many years came with uninspiring margin performance. In constant currency terms, revenue grew 7.6% sequentially, driven by a sharp rebound in its products and platforms vertical and spillover of deals from the September quarter. In a conference call with analysts, HCL’s management said fiscal third-quarter revenue growth was the highest in the past 47 quarters. What is more, last quarter, HCL signed eight large services and as many product deals spanning financial, technology and healthcare services. At the end of December, the total value contract of its new deals was $2.1 billion, an increase of 64% from a year ago. The management said the company’s deal pipeline is strong and broad-based across markets and verticals. So, it is unsurprising that HCL has retained its double-digit revenue growth guidance for FY22.   "
Updated: 13 Jan 2022,What does TCS’ buyback mean for its stock,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/tcs-announces-a-buyback-what-does-it-mean-for-its-stock-11642051980710.html,"Cash-rich Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd is walking the talk on its capital return commitment made to investors. It has announced a buyback of up to 4 crore shares with the IT company buying shares at ₹4,500 per share. This is nearly 17%, premium compared to its last traded price of the stock on the NSE when this buyback was announced. According to analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd, the buyback size is 10% larger than the buybacks announced by TCS in previous years. Yet, they feel that while the buyback may be a near term catalyst, the stock's rich valuations multiples offer limited scope for re-rating relative to its growth. Shares of TCS trade at a one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of around 31 times, showed Bloomberg data. As things stand, TCS is the most expensively valued Tier-I Indian IT stock. Analysts note that the stock's FY23 valuation multiple is around 60% premium to its long-term average. ""The company is keeping its commitment of returning capital to investors, which is a good thing. But the buyback size of ₹18,000 crore works out to 1.08% of the total paid-up equity share capital. A buyback may lead to some earnings dilution but considering the size of TCS, this is too small to provide any significant upside trigger to the stock,"" said an analyst with a domestic brokerage house requesting anonymity. It should be noted that TCS has also announced an interim dividend of ₹7 per share along with this buyback. What this also means is that focus returns to fundamentals for the stock's future performance and valuations. In Q3FY22, TCS reported a sequential constant currency revenue growth of 4%, beating consensus estimate of 2.1%. However, it lagged peer Infosys Ltd in this parameter, which reported a sequential constant currency revenue growth of 7%, much ahead of the consensus estimate of 3.7%. Further, TCS’ Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin performance has been a bit discouraging with the measure contracting 60 basis points sequentially to 25% in Q3. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The company’s deal win momentum was healthy and demand outlook is expected to be strong. Even so, TCS is likely to underperform Infosys on growth. “While TCS is set to record a 15%+ year-on-year constant currency growth for FY22, quite respectable on a standalone basis, it will underperform Infosys for the third year in a row that is rightly raising some concerns on relative underperformance and thereby valuation premium amongst Tier I techs,"" said analysts from JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd in a report on 12 January. Post Q3 results, the TCS stock was trading marginally higher on NSE in early trading hours on Thursday."
Updated: 12 Jan 2022,Positive kick-off,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/positive-kickoff-11642008842068.html,"In a first, India’s three big software companies reported their quarterly results on the same day: Wednesday. What stood out, though, was the bright performance of the top two. Tata Consultancy Services reported better-than-expected revenues for the three months ended 31 December. It also announced a share-buyback at a price that reflected a 17%-odd premium over its last close. Infosys beat analysts’ estimates of both its top and bottom lines, and raised its revenue outlook. Wipro’s profits, though, were about flat. Broadly, their momentum of snagging new information technology (IT) deals seems intact. The pandemic altered the way modern businesses operate, driving them to upgrade and redo IT systems in accordance with the demands of increased digital dependence. This has resulted in a flurry of fresh orders for Indian software majors. In addition, this export sector stands to benefit once the US raises policy interest rates, which would bolster the dollar and lift export earnings. High attrition remains a worry, though. Beyond IT, earnings in several other sectors could be buoyant. There will be laggards too. Still, a positive kick-off to the season is heartening."

The so-called embedded value of Life Insurance Corp. of India is likely to be more than 4 trillion rupees, and its market value could be about four times that amount, the people said, asking not to be identified as the discussions are private. Once the final report is in, the valuation the government is seeking could change.  Embedded value, a key metric for insurers, combines the current value of future profits with the net value of assets. The gauge will be part of LIC’s IPO prospectus that’s likely to be filed in the week starting Jan. 31. Typically, the market value of insurers is between three and five times the embedded value.  If investors agree with those calculations proposed by the government, LIC would join the league of India’s biggest companies -- Reliance Industries Ltd. and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. -- which have a market capitalization of 17 trillion rupees and 14.3 trillion rupees, respectively.  A finance ministry spokesman didn’t answer calls to his mobile phone seeking comment, while LIC declined to comment.  The government may be stretching its expectations a bit too far, two of the people said. The final valuation would be decided based on various parameters, including investor appetite, profitability outlook, and trends in the industry, they said.  The first-time share sale by the insurer is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to mop up cash and help rein in a budget deficit that’s widened in the midst of the pandemic. The government is planning to sell 5% to 10% of the company before the end of March. A call on the amount of stake to be sold will be taken by a ministerial panel later this month before LIC files the draft prospectus with the market regulator. At the valuation the government wants, a 5% stake will fetch about 750 billion rupees.   This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.
