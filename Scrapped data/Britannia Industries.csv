Updated: 06 Jun 2022,‘The world around us has turned more digital-savvy’,https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/the-world-around-us-has-turned-more-digitalsavvy-11654457755809.html,"NEW DELHI : India’s rural marketing landscape is set to change, said Amit Doshi, chief marketing officer at Bengaluru-based Britannia Industries Ltd, the maker of Good Day, Tiger, NutriChoice, Milk Bikis and Marie Gold biscuit brands. In an interview, Doshi, who had stints in Lenovo and Perfetti Van Melle, spoke of the acceleration in digital media consumption, evolution of the influencer ecosystem and the need for brands to be more empathetic in a post-covid world. Edited excerpts:   After covid-19, are brands weaving more sympathy into their messaging?  The pandemic taught marketers to be far more humane and connected with what was happening around us. There’s been a debate around purpose-led advertising, but this (pandemic) was a very different situation. I really hope that brands continue to stay humane. But at the same time, it’s very important that brands are not opportunistic about a situation like this. There is a certain role that categories and brands play in consumers’ lives and it’s extremely important that marketers are aware of where the line is. So, I would say that while it’s a good sign, it’s very important to know what role a brand can or cannot play in difficult situations. During covid, advertising for almost all of our brands turned contextual. We realized that while consumers were staying at home, they were also vulnerable to unhealthy eating. So, NutriChoice advertising was still about healthy snacking, but making sure that your hands don’t go to something unhealthy. Coming out of covid, I feel that all of us, including Britannia, need to be extremely close to the consumer. Because we’re also seeing some of the habits reverse as quickly; people are going back, they are travelling, kids are back to school.  Has the pandemic brought about a rapid shift in media spends? I’m a big believer in taking a balanced approach to marketing and media planning. It’s the classical approach of horses for courses. It completely depends on the markets that we’re speaking to, the socio-economic strata that consumers belong to. Media habits are very varied in a complex market like India. So, depending on the challenge that we have at hand, we work with first principles (of marketing) and come up with a media plan. Having said that, yes, we’ve seen digital media habits change dramatically during the pandemic. This year, that growth will accelerate. If you look projections by prominent media agencies, the prediction is that digital media spends this year will overtake those on television. That means we’ve got to keep with the pace of change, perhaps even stay ahead of the curve.  How much of this digital adoption is changing rural marketing? Has there been a fundamental change in consumer media habits on account of digital?  100%. It’s a massive change that we are seeing unfold in front of our eyes. If you see the influx of content consumption—all of these are trends that cut across the country. The world around us has definitely turned more digital-savvy, post-covid. That’s true of rural consumers as well. Cheap data connectivity, along with a smartphone at hand, and content consumption becoming more democratic, more vernacular, is certainly going to change the way the rural consumers consume media. If you look at the content creator ecosystem, content creation in India is actually bursting open across all strata of the economy. It’s not just a metro or urban phenomenon. Tomorrow’s biggest content creators are actually coming from small towns and rural centres. This will further accelerate consumption.  So, in all forms of digital, whether it’s social media, or its content platforms, like Jio, or even the digital editions of vernacular newspapers, there’s a lot of consumption that’s happening. The supply side is exploding, because the content creator ecosystem is no longer just coming from urban India. Finally, as FMCG expands on e-commerce, the pin code coverage will also increase.  If you look at all of this, I do feel that rural marketing as we know it, will change dramatically. There are some early experiments that we’re seeing in the industry.  How big is influencer marketing for Britannia? For me, influencers form one more conduit to engage with consumers. But I would say the work that most industries and companies in India still do with influencers is very scratchy where there is a product placement, and influencers carry it in their content.  Do we participate in that?  Of course, we do. So, in one case, we’ve helped transform a consumer into an influencer for the local community and now they’re the face of the brand.  In another case, which is for Marie Gold Jeera, we’ve actually used homemakers, who had clout and influence in the social media ecosystem, to actually help us develop products."
Updated: 13 May 2022,"Light packs to recycled cans, FMCG firms fight to cut costs",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/light-packs-to-recycled-cans-fmcg-firms-fight-to-cut-costs-11652384250978.html,"NEW DELHI : If the plastic container of your regular moisturiser gets easily squished or if the ₹20 pack of your favourite chips brand appears smaller, don’t be alarmed. It’s just that their manufacturers are using thinner packaging to counter runaway costs in commodities, packaging and freight. Companies are also using recycled aluminium for cans, cutting advertising and marketing spends and postponing new launches. Parle Products, which makes biscuits under the Parle-G and Krack Jack brands, is looking at savings from carton configuration - meaning, it is looking at ways to add more packets of biscuits or snacks per carton. This will help the company lower its transport costs. This comes after Parle’s 7-8% price hike in the last six months, including both grammage cuts and direct price increases. Parle is also reducing the size packet sizes in its confectionery and snacks portfolio. “What we have done as part of our efforts to bring in cost efficiencies is started reducing the plastic used in our packs. It’s not more viable to give additional plastic unnecessarily,"" said Krishnarao Buddha, senior category head at Parle Products. This helps the company save packaging and transport costs. Rival Britannia Industries said it is doubling down on its cost saving programmes, as the inflationary situation looks “fairly grim"". This includes reducing distance to market as well as making its sourcing strategy more efficient. Varun Berry, managing director, Britannia said at a post earnings call on 4 May that the company is bringing in process automation to raise productivity, reducing distance to market to reduce cost and provide fresh products to consumers, reducing wastage at the factory and the marketplace, and moving to a target of using up to 60% of renewable energy. “That’s working quite well. From a material standpoint, our sourcing strategy is focused towards making sure that we get the best bang out of our buck,"" Berry said. Varun Chaudhary, managing director of CG Corp Global, which makes Wai Wai noodles said the company has had to re-evaluate its plans to make a bigger play in the biscuits category. “With the whole cost rise, now we are re-evaluating our prospect. Biscuit has maximum flour and also palm oil. Palm oil prices have touched an all-time high,"" he said. Food and beverage maker PepsiCo India said it is accelerating the mix of higher revenue packs to mitigate the impact of increase in commodity prices and inflationary pressures. “Rising input costs, particularly palm oil and paper, and increase freight costs have put significant pressure on the margins,"" a company spokesperson said. Brewer AB InBev said it does not see challenges related to higher raw material prices abating soon. The maker of Budweiser beer is working with its suppliers to increase the recycled content of aluminium in its cans, among other steps to trim costs. The beer industry has limited options to adjust to increased costs, as liquor prices are routed via state excise departments in India. “We witness this impact across our supply chain with materials like barley along with packaging costs remaining high. These essential materials for our business have always been the most stable in terms of pricing and availability,"" said Ashwin Kak, procurement & sustainability head, India & South East Asia, AB InBev. Kak said the company has introduced circular packaging initiatives like replacing cardboard packaging with material made from barley straw to carry its products. Beverage maker Coca-Cola India Pvt. Ltd is promoting returnable glass bottles, after years of focusing on disposable plastic bottles."

Updated: 02 Apr 2022,More consumers switch to smaller packs as inflation pinches,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/more-consumers-switch-to-smaller-packs-as-inflation-pinches-11648838494236.html,"New Delhi: Indian consumers have started purchasing smaller packs of packaged goods as high inflation puts pressure on household budgets. Contribution of low-priced packs to overall sales within categories such as beverages, personal care and commodities moved up by 2%, 4% and 10.5% respectively in rural India between January and first week of March, according to data shared by retail technology platform Bizom. In urban India, contribution from lower price points in categories such as confectionery, commodities, home care and packaged foods moved up by 2.8%, 2.9%, 5.9% and 13.7% respectively. Commodities consist of packaged and branded edible oils, spices, rice, and flour. To be sure, a switch to low priced packs in categories such as confectionery and beverages was also driven by a strong return in out-of-home consumption during the period. Meanwhile, contribution of high value packs across all categories in urban India reported a decline, as per the retail intelligence platform that tracks sales across 7.5 million retail stores. Bizom compared the data to pre-covid period or 2020. “Across both urban and rural India, we see a strong trend of increased consumption across lower price points. Price inflation is among the key drivers of this shift across categories especially among commodity products driven by hyper-inflation in these products,"" said Akshay D’Souza, chief of growth and insights, Bizom. Companies selling everything from soaps, detergents to biscuits and edible oils have taken price hikes—prompting shoppers to look at cheaper or value alternatives. On Thursday Bloomberg reported that cake and cookie maker Britannia Industries Ltd. plans to hike prices as much as 7%. In large categories such as soaps, detergents, shampoo, biscuits and edible oils, price hikes have been to the tune of 15-20% year-on-year within key stock keeping units, analysts at BNP Paribas India said in a report dated 17 March. They noted that such price hikes were insufficient to offset cost inflation. They also flagged some downtrading within the fast-moving consumer goods market. “With price increase ahead of income growth, sector volume growth moderated and we see likelihood of some downtrading. After large price increases in the preceding period, we have seen relatively lower price hikes in Jan-March 2022, as companies could have been looking for consumers to absorb the recent price hikes and expecting commodity costs to moderate,"" they said. Meanwhile, consumers switched to cheaper packets in commodities such as edible oils and pulses. In personal care, fewer social interactions were prompting consumers to purchase lower usage packs, especially in rural areas, the Bizom data revealed. “With more price inflation on the horizon, we will see pressure on personal care and other discretionary products as consumers could look to rationalize their monthly spends by cutting on usage here,"" said D’Souza. In home care, data pointed to consumer preference toward high price point packs in rural. “In urban the wide availability of hygiene products is leading to this shift while rural consumers still seem to be buying longer duration packs as availability of their preferred brands seems to be erratic,"" the firm said in its findings. Meanwhile, companies said higher fuel prices could put pressure on household budgets, especially, for socio-economic classes B and C. “While we have not witnessed that in our business because it’s an everyday consumption item—be it milk or curd but I’m sure there is an inflationary pressure on consumers and across categories. Especially SEC B and C consumers are feeling the pinch of petroleum prices,"" said Sanjay Sharma, Business Head, dairy products, Mother Dairy Fruit & Vegetable Pvt. Ltd. Companies are likely to push cheaper and smaller stock keeping units, said others. “Consumers will downgrade to smaller and cheaper brands as well as. You will find better distribution for cheaper stock keeping units, that is, at price points of Rs10 and Rs20,"" said Aditya Goel, co-founder of Love in Store, a trade activation and execution company that works with FMCG companies and retailers. Bizom said within beverages demand trends indicate that mid-sized packs are leading growth. “Out of home packs for what is expected to be a warm summer and the upcoming IPL season, can help spike consumption at home too,"" said D’Souza. Parle Agro that sells juices and fizzy drinks said demand for its products remained firm as mobility improved. The company that sells Frooti and Appy Fizz beverages has not taken any price hikes in order to keep demand intact. “Two of our largest segments are really value packs which are at the Rs10 and lower price points. And then the larger value packs, which are for home consumption, those are two of our largest segments. From a value for money perspective that’s been something we’re very conscious of, and we’ve been able to provide that to consumers consistently,"" said Nadia Chauhan, JMD and CMO, Parle Agro."
Updated: 26 Mar 2022,It's raining earnings downgrades but these stocks offer some respite,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/its-raining-earnings-downgrades-but-these-stocks-offer-some-respite-11648185069187.html,"The steep increase in prices of raw materials such as crude oil and metals following the Russia-Ukraine conflict has exposed many Indian companies to severe margin pressure, an analysis by domestic brokerage house IIFL Securities Ltd showed that. This is anticipated to lead to an increased risk of earnings downgrades. ""What began as an earnings sensitivity analysis has now started appearing more like an earnings downgrade expectation, because the values we assumed for the purpose of sensitivity for key variables − Brent crude (US$110), LME Metals Index (5000), US$/INR (78) and interest rates (100 basis points higher) − have begun looking like the more-likely levels that will sustain in FY23,"" IIFL said in a report on 23 March. One basis point is one hundredeth of a percentage point. Investors should note that many companies across the board rely on crude-based derivatives as inputs. For some companies, plastic products which are byproducts of crude, hurt their packing costs. These include cement, tyres, fast moving consumer goods and paint makers, among others. For the purpose of this analysis, IIFL has identified stocks price behaviour starting 23 February, when news flow on the war started impacting the markets. Results showed that CEAT Ltd, Apollo Tyres Ltd, MRF Ltd, Indian Oil, Kansai Nerolac, Paints Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd, Century Plyboards India Ltd, Havells India Ltd, Nykaa (FSN E-commerce Ventures Ltd), Berger Paints (I) Ltd, Cipla Ltd and CRISIL Ltd are the stocks where risks of a earnings downgrade is emerging.

Updated: 31 Jan 2022,"Britannia’s Q3 margin drags, revenue shines",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/britannias-q3-margin-drags-revenue-shines-11643563568401.html,"Britannia Industries Ltd had to battle a tough cost environment during the December quarter (Q3FY22) owing to persistent commodity cost inflation. While the packaged foods company’s gross margin was expected to drop year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q3, the extent of decline was more than expected. Last quarter, Britannia’s consolidated gross margin shrank as much as 518 basis points (bps) versus the year-ago period to 37.9%. One basis point is 0.01%. This is also the third consecutive quarter of y-o-y drop in Britannia’s gross margin. In Q1 and Q2, too, the company’s gross margin had dropped by 502bps and 296bps, y-o-y, respectively. The company said it continued to see an increase in commodity prices in Q3, with inflation about 4% sequentially and about 20% y-o-y. “We actioned price increases ahead of competition. But the upward trajectory in prices of commodities and fuel impacted profitability, which led us to action further price increases and accelerate cost efficiency programmes,"" said Britannia. It is somewhat comforting that the gross margin has improved sequentially, though below expectations. Further, a fall in employee costs helped curb the drop in Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margin a bit. Ebitda margin dropped by 422bps y-o-y to 15.1%. The upshot: Ebitda in Q3 fell by 11.7% to about ₹540 crore. This is at a time when Britannia’s revenue performance beat expectations, with operating revenues increasing by 13.7% y-o-y to ₹3,531 crore. “Strong growth in revenue was buoyed by volume growth of about 5% (we expected +4%) and net realizations being higher by about 8.5% (versus our forecast of 7.5%),"" said analysts from JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd in a report on 29 January. “Britannia’s ability to sustain volume growth at this level despite price hikes in the category is commendable, especially as nearly two-thirds of the price hikes (for price-pointed packs) need to be effected by grammage adjustments,"" the broker added. In the past one year, Britannia’s shares have declined by 2.6% vis-à-vis the 7.6% gain in the Nifty FMCG index. Bloomberg data shows the stock trades at almost 43 times estimated earnings for FY23. While valuations may not seem demanding, near-term triggers for the stock appear limited. Hereon, investors would closely track the impact on volumes, owing to subdued rural demand. In general, easing commodity costs will bring much needed relief to consumer companies, including Britannia."

In an open letter to companies such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd., Marico, Dabur India, ITC Ltd., Britannia Industries, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd., Nestle India, etc the industry body has called for a non-cooperation movement from 1 January against FMCG companies if their needs are not addressed. The federation that represents over 4,00,000 distributors and stockiest has placed several demands in front of FMCG companies asking for equal treatment of all those engaged in the distribution of FMCG goods as well as seeking price parity. In its letter, AICPDF has sought one pricing and scheme pan-India—that it said will eliminate cross border flow of goods that occurs when goods are being sold at cheaper rates in different markets. It has also asked FMCG companies to “rework margins"" to take into account any incremental costs borne on account of inflation. “We are authorized channel partners of your company in our designated area. We have earned reputation and goodwill amongst our retailers by giving them good service for many years. We understand that Jiomart and other B2B companies are offering them the same products of your company at a lesser price than what we offer them and this is adversely affecting our reputation and goodwill. Hence, our demand is that we also receive those products at prices at which we also can offer the same prices as Jiomart and B2B companies,"" it said. Distributors of large fast-moving consumer goods companies have for years dominated how products reach retailers and consumers. Lately, they have been at loggerheads with consumer products companies as new-age companies offer better prices and technology backbone to retailers potentially threatening their trade. AICPDF has urged FMCG companies to ensure that no preferential treatment is given to any enterprise irrespective of its volumes. If a company is unable to provide such pricing parity, the association said it will “drop"" the products sold by Jiomart and B2B companies from its portfolio. In its letter seeking favourable terms from companies—members of AICPDF said they will sale of new products till they get a guarantee from the company that such products will not be made available on Jiomart and other business to business companies in the future. It has appealed to companies to call for a meeting with their respective distributors as well as representatives of AICPDF to discuss and “sort out the matter"". Moreover, it has sought tighter monitoring on the flow of goods seeking the formation of a draft committee as well as setting up a regulatory body with various industry stakeholders to address future issues."
Updated: 12 Nov 2021,"Increasing prices of your morning coffee, biscuits are troubling RBI. Here's why",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/increasing-prices-of-your-morning-coffee-biscuits-are-troubling-rbi-here-s-why-11636681467462.html,"A clutch of Indian companies have turned increasingly vocal about their inflation concerns, setting the stage for raising prices that could test the central bank’s resolve to keep borrowing costs lower for longer to support the economy. Companies from Hindustan Unilever Ltd., the Indian arm of Unilever Plc, to Nestle India Ltd. have pointed to profit-squeeze from higher input costs and supply chain strains, while the likes of Dabur India Ltd., a maker of packaged honey and hair oil, and Britannia Industries Ltd. have already passed on some of the increased costs to consumers. That could see India’s headline inflation snap a four-month slowing trend in October, with data due later Friday expected to show the print inching up to 4.4%, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Consumer prices are seen accelerating further as a higher base of comparison from a year ago fades. “There is no substitute for price increases in an environment like this,"" Varun Berry, managing director at Britannia, told analysts in a post-earnings call this month. “So we have actioned price increases."" While several central banks have responded to price pressures by raising interest rates, the Reserve Bank of India has stuck with its inflation-is-transitory narrative as it sees the headline number edging lower on higher food output after a bountiful monsoon.  The expected food price-led moderation in India’s inflation was cited by Governor Shaktikanta Das as reason enough to continue with the easy monetary policy to support what he called a “delicately poised"" economic recovery. The RBI’s rate-panel is scheduled to meet early next month to review policy settings. Although the central bank sees inflation ending at 5.3% for the year ending March 2022, well within its 2%-6% target range, economists see the headline number hiding persistent price pressures. “The year-on-year estimates of retail inflation mask the real inflationary undercurrent prevailing in the economy due to statistical base effect,"" said Jay Shankar, chief economist at Incred Capital in Mumbai. “Corporate results continue to underline the raw material inflation led hit on margins, and is likely to persist for a few more quarters due to the slack in the economy."" What Bloomberg Economics Say... “Given the prospect of inflation heating up again and the recovery gathering momentum, we see a risk that the RBI raises rates a bit sooner than our current expectations for a reverse repo rate hike in April 2022 followed by a policy repo rate increase in February 2023."" -- Abhishek Gupta, senior India economist Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration last week cut an excise levy on diesel and gasoline, with an aim to check inflationary pressures and allow the central bank more room to keep borrowing costs low. The move, according to economists including those at IDFC First Bank Ltd. and Yes Bank Ltd., would help lower consumer price inflation by 10 to 14 basis points. Still, a surge in pent-up demand from Indians emerging out of lockdowns could see businesses regain pricing power that could drive inflation faster. “A substantial rise in prices charged for the provision of services in India had no detrimental impact on demand,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. “That said, service providers were concerned that persistent inflationary pressures could deter growth in the coming year."" Those are among risks, which Incred’s Shankar said could turn the RBI hawkish sooner than currently being priced in by markets. “Regardless of near-term inflation prints, the market is focused on the spillover impact of rising global commodity prices and potential Fed QE tapering on India’s monetary policy,"" said Anubhuti Sahay, an economist at Standard Chartered Plc.

Updated: 01 Oct 2021,Britannia Industries to invest Rs340 crore in new plant in Uttar Pradesh,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/britannia-industries-to-invest-rs340-crore-in-new-plant-in-uttar-pradesh-11633085309518.html,"NEW DELHI: Packaged foods company Britannia Industries Ltd on Friday said it has commenced work on its greenfield manufacturing facility in Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh. The plant to be set up across 30 acre, at an investment of Rs340 crore, will have an annual production capacity of 1.25 lakh tonne. The company will make more of its flagship brands including Marie Gold, 5050, Good Day, Milk Bikis, Tiger Glucose and Rusk. This is Britannia’s first greenfield manufacturing facility in Uttar Pradesh. ""Uttar Pradesh is a large consumption market for us and this facility will help us meet the growing demand for bakery products in Uttar Pradesh, and will also create fairly large-scale employment opportunities,"" Varun Berry, managing director, Britannia Industries, said in a statement. Britannia has been augmenting capacity amid growing demand for its bakery products and packaged foods that it said merits investments. In October last year, Britannia had increased its planned investment for Tamil Nadu to ₹550 crore from ₹300 crore, over a period of seven years. In August this year, the company announced an investment of Rs94 crore to expand capacity at its manufacturing plant in Khordha, Odisha. The new capacities in Odisha will be operational by October 2022. In-home consumption of biscuits, cookies, noodles and snacks benefitted as India moved into strict lockdowns to help arrest the spread of the pandemic. Consumers are also likely to shift to more packaged foods and pick brands they trust in the aftermath of the pandemic. Large companies are therefore accelerating product launches and reach. Work on the new manufacturing facility in Uttar Pradesh will commence in October and commercial production will begin in 15 months. The proposed facility will source key input materials such as wheat flour, sugar, and other ingredients locally thereby supporting a cross-section of the farming community in the state."
Updated: 24 Aug 2021,Consumer staples cos put up a resilient show in June quarter,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/consumer-staples-cos-put-up-a-resilient-show-in-june-quarter-11629743351689.html,"Indian consumer staples companies put up a good show for the quarter ended June on the revenue front. A favourable base helped, as the relatively stringent pandemic restrictions last year had weighed heavily on demand in Q1FY21. Companies also used their learnings from the previous year’s lockdown to minimize disruptions in production and supply chain this time around. What’s more, rural demand was strong despite being adversely impacted. A combination of these factors boosted their revenue growth. “Staples pack revenues grew 16% yoy (organic) and +7% on a two-year CAGR basis,"" Kotak Institutional Equities analysts said in a report on 20 August. CAGR is compounded annual growth rate. According to the broker, this growth was led by Britannia Industries Ltd, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL), Jyothy Labs Ltd, Dabur India Ltd and Marico Ltd, registering +12.3%, 11%, 11.5%, 7.2% and 8% two-year CAGR, respectively. Note that Britannia’s Q1FY22 operating revenues exceeded analysts’ estimates, even though the tailwinds from the pandemic were not expected to be as high as last year’s. GCPL’s home care segment did well, with the household insecticides portfolio putting up a strong show. India’s largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firm, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), marginally missed some analysts’ expectations on revenue, posting nearly 13% year-on-year growth in standalone revenues. Within the segments, HUL’s home care business performed well, helped by double-digit growth in fabric wash. For the sector, higher input costs played spoilsport on margins. “Raw material inflation was more than expected for the second consecutive quarter,"" wrote analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 13 August. “Coverage (universe) gross margin (excluding ITC, Varun Beverages) contracted 220 basis points (bps) quarter-on-quarter (versus our estimate of 40bps decline) to 49.6%, lowest in at least five years. This follows a 1.6 percentage point quarter-on-quarter moderation already seen in the last quarter,"" they added. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Here, GCPL and Marico’s sequential gross margin declines were higher at 370bps and 310bps, respectively. Needless to say, to cope with higher costs, many firms have taken calibrated price hikes across categories in the past few months. With the second wave ebbing, investors can anticipate a good recovery in Q2FY22. While that augurs well, it’s worth noting that valuations of consumer staples’ firms don’t offer scope for meaningful upsides hereon. On Monday, shares of HUL, GCPL and Dabur touched new 52-week highs on the NSE. Based on Bloomberg data, HUL stock trades at 57 times estimated earnings for FY23. This measure for Marico, Britannia, GCPL and Dabur stocks stands at 44 times, 45 times, 46 times and 49 times, respectively. As such, valuations are not cheap."

On the other hand, discretionary portfolios and summer consumption have been negatively impacted,"" the brokerage said in a report on the consumer staples sector This is especially true for packaged food companies as consumers bought more biscuits, edible oils, snacks, and frozen foods for in-home consumption. Britannia Industries, Tata Consumer and ITC’s FMCG segment, which has a strong in-home consumption portfolio, evinced good response, boosting volumes and therefore revenues. GCPL also saw a similar effect due to its household insecticide, personal care and hygiene portfolios, it said. Revenue growth was also aided by price hikes taken by several large companies over the last two quarter as commodity pressures remained high. Companies selling soaps, packaged tea, edible oil, snacks etc took prices hikes in March and June quarters. “Revenue and volume growth over two years were shaped mostly by portfolio mix, and relevant and activations riding evolving consumer trends. Revenue growth has benefited from pricing action as most companies took some pricing action to combat inflation,"" the brokerage added. Meanwhile, discretionary goods such as personal care products are yet to fully recover. For instance, ITC’s cigarettes volumes fell 18% on a two-year basis. Bajaj also performed poorly due to discretionary nature of its portfolio. Several companies diversified their portfolio, launching surface cleaners and disinfectants as demand for such products surged. “Companies which were quick to launch products and activations based on consumer trends like rising concern for health, safety and immunity driven by pandemic saw increased revenue traction,"" the report added."

The company, which is being cautiously optimistic, has infused ₹130 crore in capacity building in the current fiscal, an official said.It is also eyeing at a greater revenue share from e-commerce which currently contributes two per cent. “The commodity inflation was sharp during the (first) quarter (of the current fiscal). We are taking price calls in a calibrated and gradual way to offset the cost pressure,"" Britannia managing director Varun Berry told PTI. The company, in the recent past, had taken price calls in value products but the constant cost pressures were not enough to match the impact which is estimated at 5-6 per cent. The biscuit maker had posted a 29 per cent decline in consolidated net profit to ₹389 crore for the quarter ended June 30 over the corresponding period last year. According to company officials, it is not easy to increase the prices of the products during difficult times, and the same has been done in a calibrated approach.Amid disruptions due to COVID-19, it stays optimistic with a steady unlocking process that would result in greater traction in consumption, they said. The company is focusing on new product launches, they said, adding that it has introduced ""fusion snacking"" and expanded Britannia 50-50 basket. It unveiled the first-ever potato-based biscuits under the brand, ""5050 Potazos"".The product was unveiled in Assam and other North-East markets and will be rolled out in rest of the country in the coming months, the officials said.The COVID-induced lockdown had disrupted product launches as trials were delayed, they said.To meet demand, Britannia continues to invest in capacity building in various product lines, including dairy. “We have invested ₹130 crore in the capacity building during the quarter. The company was expanding the Khurda plant in Odhisa, and Tamil Nadu facility. A greenfield unit is also coming up in Uttar Pradesh and land has already been acquired,"" Berry said. The new Ranjangaon plant in Maharashtra will add new products lines, including dairy.In the Khurda plant, about ₹94 crore was invested to ramp up capacity in multiple categories.The greenfield facility in Uttar Pradesh will entail an investment of about ₹300 crore, the official said.Berry said e-commerce sales gained momentum and reached two per cent of the revenue from about 0.4-0.5 per cent earlier, but he thinks the contribution should rise to five per cent. Britannia will work more closely with partners having expertise in this trade, the official added.  "
Updated: 02 Aug 2021,"Margin unexciting, but revenue brings cheer for Britannia in Q1",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/britannia-industries-margins-take-a-knock-in-q1-as-cost-pressures-bite-11627887071376.html,"Britannia Industries Ltd’s shares closed more than 2% higher on Monday on the National Stock Exchange. One reason for this optimism is that the June quarter (Q1FY22) results were decent on the revenue front despite last year’s strong base. This is at a time when inflationary pressures gave grief, hurting margins. Consolidated gross profit margins in Q1 dropped by 296 basis points (bps) year-on-year to 38.7%. One basis point is 0.01%. Gross margin is down sequentially, too, decreasing by 178bps. The company continued to see an increase in the prices of palm oil and crude oil. “In view of the pandemic and the hardship to consumers, we were cautious with our price increases and aggressive on cost efficiencies,"" said Britannia in its earnings presentation. To cope with the cost pressures, it will take judicious price increases ahead, and continue to drive cost efficiencies. As such, Britannia was able to marginally increase its Ebitda margin vis-à-vis Q4FY21, although the measure was down almost 470bps compared to Q1FY21 to 16.3%. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Meanwhile, revenues declined by 1% year-on-year to ₹3,352 crore on a strong base given that Q1FY21 revenue growth was 26.4%. The company has exceeded analysts’ revenue estimates even as the tailwinds from the covid-19 pandemic were not expected to be as high this time around. Last year, Britannia reaped the benefits of a sharp rise in consumption at home as consumers spent more time indoors during the first lockdown. On a two-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) basis, Britannia’s revenue growth for Q1FY22 stands at around 12%, which is nothing to sneeze at. Even so, the Britannia stock has massively underperformed the broader markets in the past one year. To that extent, valuations are inexpensive. The shares now trade at about 40 times estimated earnings for financial year 2023, based on Bloomberg data. Unfortunately, triggers for the stock to outperform appear limited. Going ahead, investors would closely follow Britannia’s strategy on price hikes to offset cost pressures. “We believe success of (at least few) new segments—Salty Snacks, Wafers, Croissants and ramp-up of adjacent categories—Dairy, Rusks, Cakes and now Milk Bikis in biscuits are imperative for re-rating,"" said analysts from ICICI Securities Ltd in a report on 1 August. The broker further added, “While lower ad spends in FY21 have driven higher profit growth versus revenue growth, FY22 is likely to be a low-profit-growth year."" Of course, a better-than-expected revenue performance would help improve sentiments."

Consolidated revenue from operations for the three months ended 30 June stood at ₹3,403.46 crore, down marginally from the ₹3,420.67 crore it reported in the year-ago period. Estimates by 21 analysts had pegged Britannia’s consolidated revenue at ₹3171.10 crore, while projecting quarterly consolidated profit of ₹412.10 crore. The company continued to witness higher commodity prices, especially palm oil and crude. Other expenses grew 9.27% during the quarter. “On the cost front, we continued to witness increase in the prices of palm oil and crude. In light of hardship to the consumers owing to the pandemic, we were cautious on pricing but aggressive on cost efficiencies, which helped us improve our operating profit from 14.9% in Q4FY20-21 to 15.1% in Q1F21-22,"" Varun Berry, managing director, Britannia Industries Ltd., said. In the June quarter of the last fiscal, Britannia posted a 26% jump in sales as it benefitted significantly from increased in-home consumption. Indian households bought more biscuits during India’s protracted lockdown a year ago. The second wave of covid-19 that struck the country hard was followed by lockdowns imposed by various state governments. While companies saw limited supply-side disruptions, demand normalized with consumers going easy on pantry-stocking. “We witnessed evolving nature of the pandemic as well as consumer sentiment and behaviour. In these uncertain times, we delivered a healthy consolidated 24-month sales growth of 25% and net profit growth of 55%,"" he said. The company warned of “calibrated"" price increases in the future. ""Britannia will continue to create and sustain an ecosystem of financial and operating efficiencies through rigorous process improvements which would act as a strong pillar for sustainable growth,"" Berry said. During the quarter the company relaunched Goodday Chocochips with a campaign and launched 50-50 Potazos in the northeast.

After the sharp re-rating, 2021 has begun on a relatively slow note with the shares gaining around 5% so far. This is after accounting for nearly a 5% drop in early deals on Friday, after the company’s March quarter financial results disappointed the Street. Consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) declined by 2.6% over the same period last year to Rs300 crore vis-à-vis Bloomberg consensus estimates of Rs353 crore. Ebitda margins contracted by 294 basis points year-on-year to 9.9%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. True, margins were expected to take a hit considering the extraordinarily sharp spike in tea prices. Even so, margin is lower than expectations. Tata Consumer said, “Consolidated Ebitda growth for the quarter was impacted by tea inflation in India and increased A&P investments, which more than offset the strong Ebitda growth in India food and international business."" A&P refers to advertising and promotion expenses. Even so, JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd’s analysts point out, there are two aspects in the March quarter report that merit attention and monitoring. One, Sampann portfolio grew just 2% during the quarter. Tata Consumer has said the volatility in the pulses market has impacted growth. According to JM Financial, a business that is all of Rs400 crore in size per year should not have been impacted so badly by such macro events. It is also worth noting that the salt revenues saw robust growth in the March quarter, boosting the company’s India foods segments. Two, the international beverages business was especially weak. “While there is some high-base effect here due to pantry-loading in March quarter last year, the imputed 'normalized' growth rate seems to remind us that these are businesses that would continue to exhibit low-growth characteristics over the medium-term, once low-hanging fruits therein are plucked."" Overall, Tata Consumer’s revenues grew by 26% year-on-year to Rs3,037 crore. Weaker operating profit meant pre-tax and exceptional item earnings grew at a much slower pace of 5.8%. Meanwhile, the sharp appreciation in Tata Consumer’s shares since 2020 has understandably increased its valuations. As things stand, the Tata Consumer shares are higher than peer Britannia Industries Ltd’s. For perspective: Tata Consumer stock trades at 49 times financial year 2022 estimated earnings, based on Bloomberg data. The same parameter for Britannia stands at 45 times. As such, Tata Consumer’s high valuations could well limit upsides hereon."
Updated: 30 Apr 2021,FMCG companies eye virtual orders to shield staff,https://www.livemint.com/industry/retail/companies-face-manpower-challenge-step-up-virtual-orders-11619790553165.html,"New Delhi: Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms are trying to minimize mobilization of sales staff and not looking to expand their distribution networks in view of the massive spike in coronavirus cases, and are instead opting for virtual orders to keep their frontline workers safe. Britannia Industries, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), Parle Products and GCPL, among others, said they are keeping a tab on frontline staff. “In times like this, we are actually asking our salespeople not to go to the market. So again, we are going to see a downtrend as far as our distribution is concerned; there will be a lot more sales on telephone and a lot more wholesale trade during this time. I think, it’s unfortunate, because you build your distribution and then something like this happens and you have no choice but to tread on the side of caution as far as your employees are concerned. This wave just seems to be a very, very vicious wave of covid,"" Varun Berry, managing director, Britannia Industries, said in a post-earnings call this week. The second wave has led to a record number of daily infections and climbing death rates. Last year’s pan-India lockdown had disrupted supplies to all companies, including in the procurement of raw material, production and access to the market. Even though the companies are in better control of production and supplies, the infection has taken its toll on sales staff and other frontline workers. “As far as salesmen are concerned, yes we are also concerned because there are pockets where despite our very high standards and protocols, people have got impacted. Our entire focus has been on how we best look after them,"" said Sanjiv Mehta, chairman and managing director, HUL. “One of the steps that we are very clear about is that we will facilitate and, if necessary, pay for the vaccination of not just our employees and their families, but all the people who are in our ecosystem. Which comes to nearly about 300,000 people, including the salesmen. But yes, we also have our fair share of people who have been infected,"" he added. HUL said 90% of eligible employees have been inoculated with the first dose. “Supply is an important element given the localized restrictions. Today, our capacity available is 1.3x where we were pre-covid. We have initiated multiple models to make sure stocks are available downstream and, therefore, closer to the consumers,"" said Srinivas Phatak, HUL’s chief financial officer in a post-earnings call. “We have driven the digital agenda hard. And today, more than 500,000 outlets can order digitally...We have almost added at the rate of 1,000 outlets a day in the last year to create this capacity,"" he said. In an earlier interview, Sunil Kataria, chief executive, India and SAARC, Godrej Consumer Products, said as a precautionary step it had advised its sales teams to work from home. Kataria said over the last year, the company has leveraged technology and built systems to manage different aspects of its sales and engage with partners in the ecosystem, which is helping the company ensure stocks reach markets."
Updated: 29 Apr 2021,Britannia’s Q4 margin disappoints; stock lacks triggers ahead,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/britannias-q4-margin-disappoints-stock-lacks-triggers-ahead-11619635264014.html,"Shares of Britannia Industries Ltd declined by around 2% on Wednesday, a day the benchmark Nifty 50 index gained 1.4%. Investors are discouraged by the packaged foods company’s profit margin performance in the quarter ended March. While Britannia’s consolidated gross profit margin expanded by 80 basis points on a year-on-year basis to 40.5%, the measure has declined by 262 basis points vis-à-vis the December quarter. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Britannia has said that on the commodity cost front, palm oil, packing material and dairy products witnessed sudden and steep increases.  But it’s not as if the margin outlook is bright, going ahead. Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a report on 28 April: “We also lower our margin estimates given rising input cost pressures and delayed pricing actions due to a weak demand environment. We see gross margins contracting in H1FY22 and normalizing in H2."" Besides, higher advertising spends are also likely to weigh on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin performance. For the March quarter, Ebitda margin increased by 30 basis points to 16.1% compared to the corresponding period last year. Other expenses increased at a faster rate, capping Ebitda margin expansion. To be sure, Britannia’s revenue performance was satisfactory in the March quarter with operating revenues increasing by 8.2% year-on-year to ₹3,038 crore. Having said that, the base for the current quarter is high considering that in the June 2020 quarter, revenues had increased as much as 26.4% year-on-year. Britannia had benefited from the increase in at-home consumption during last year’s covid-19 lockdown. But the firm is unlikely to gain in a similar manner during the second covid-19 wave. In fact, analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a report on 27 April: “With the onset of the second covid wave, biscuit category is seeing some tailwinds due to pantry stocking. However, unlike last year, there has not been a major supply disruption and, hence, Britannia would not have the benefit of lower competition."" As such, the above mentioned factors are expected to keep sentiments muted for the Britannia stock in the coming days. The shares trade at nearly 45 times estimated earnings for financial year 2022, according to Bloomberg data."

The company had posted a consolidated net profit of ₹372.35 crore in the same quarter a year ago, Britannia Industries said in a regulatory filing. Consolidated total revenue from operations during the quarter under review stood at ₹3,130.75 crore as against ₹2,867.70 crore in the year-ago period, a growth of 9 per cent. The company, however, said it incurred higher expenses in the fourth quarter at ₹2,701.87 crore as compared to ₹2,488.88 crore in the corresponding period previous year. The cost of materials consumed stood at ₹1,532.35 crore during the fourth quarter as against ₹1,307.97 crore in the corresponding period previous fiscal. Commenting on the performance, Britannia Industries Managing Director Varun Berry said, ""On the commodity cost front, palm oil, packing material and dairy products witnessed sudden and steep increases while strategic buying helped the company manage the cost increases better. We are evaluating the long-term impact of these increases to action necessary price increases while ensuring competitiveness."" During the quarter, he said, ""We continued focussing on the basic building blocks of our business, direct reach, rural distribution and brand building. Our cost-efficiency programme for the year delivered the targeted results giving us strong cost leadership."" Berry further said in the fourth quarter the company implemented three transformational digital projects namely S4 HANA, an Online Dealer Management System and an Integrated Vendor Management System. ""The delivery of these projects necessitated shutdown of operations for a few days in March which impacted primary billing for the quarter,"" he added. However, Berry said, ""We are confident that with all the core systems getting upgraded and integrated we are well poised to take our business efficiencies to the next level while leveraging the large amounts of data available to build business intelligence and analytics."" For the fiscal ended March 31, the company posted a consolidated net profit of ₹1,850.59 crore as against ₹1,393.60 crore in the previous year, a growth of 33 per cent. Consolidated total revenue for FY21 was at ₹13,136.14 crore as against ₹11,599.55 crore, the company said. ""The year has been difficult and challenging in every possible way. Despite the adverse conditions, we managed to deliver good results in terms of topline growth, profitability improvement and market share gains,"" Berry said. As the country reels under the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, Britannia Industries said, ""In these unprecedented times, we have put the physical and emotional wellbeing of our employees and their families above everything else."" Employees who are working in the frontline are provided financial protection through insurance and other means in addition to special leaves and unstinted organizational support, it added."

Updated: 09 Feb 2021,"FMCG cos strengthen distributors, sales staff as rural demand grows",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/fmcg-cos-strengthen-distributors-sales-staff-as-rural-demand-grows-11612872310621.html,"New Delhi: Upbeat on growth in rural markets, major fast-moving consumer goods makers are shoring up efforts to get more distributors and stockists on ground in India’s smaller cities and villages. This could lead to a rise in hiring by up to 25% this year, said temporary staffing firms. “There's definitely an uptick in hiring, specifically for the frontline people,"" said Balasubramanian A, business head, clients, TeamLease Services. Also Read | India should worry about its public debt Large consumer goods companies typically work with thousands of distributors across the country and each distributor further has a posse of sales staff. Expansion for most fast-moving consumer goods companies happens on the back of a new distributor or a super stockist—that works in a certain territory and ensures access of products to various retailers in the area, said Balasubramanian. Rural markets have become an engine of growth for large packaged goods companies including Hindustan Unilever, Marico and Dabur among others, over the last three quarters, as parts of urban markets are still reporting muted growth. India’s villages that constitute 36% of sales for FMCG firms, were in a slump in 2019. These markets, however, reported strong growth in the first quarter of the current financial year helped by reverse migration, favourable government schemes and normal monsoon last year. Reverse migration has also helped move consumption trends to India’s smaller cities helping in brisk sale of packaged goods, Balasubramanian said. As a result, for most companies, rural demand continues to march ahead of urban. Jyothy Labs said sales in rural markets grew upwards of 15% in December quarter, while urban markets reported 7-8% growth. Marico Limited, on the other hand, reported a 24% growth in rural volumes in general trade in the December quarter. The company has added more stockists in India’s villages. Its rural distribution could go up 20% over the next few years, said Sanjay Mishra, chief operating officer, India sales and chief executive officer, new business, Marico Limited. “For Marico, rural has been a growth engine for the last 2-3 years, which has been further accelerated in the past 12 months. In Q3FY21 alone, general trade has witnessed a 24% growth in volume terms in the rural market,"" he said. Further, Marico's continued focus on expanding direct distribution enabled the company to develop a wide network of stockists in the rural market. ""We have added 30% new stockists over the last two years. This growth has been driven through different go-to-market models such as super distributors, including stockists as well as ready-stock van units. Going forward, we will also experiment with various different models to penetrate deeper into the rural markets, with an aim to grow the network by 20% in the next couple of years,"" said Mishra. Biscuit maker Britannia Industries added more distributors in rural markets after the lockdown-led disruptions impacted trade. The company has been steadily growing its access in rural areas. Between March 2020 and December 2020, the number of rural preferred dealers, as the company calls them, were up from 19,000 to 23,000. “….our rural distribution is solid, we've again put on more distributors in rural areas. I think during the covid period, there was irregularity of service from our distributors because of obvious reasons. But now, we've brought the discipline back into place, we made sure that supervision is happening, and execution is happening as per the norms set by us, and we are now back to a very solid 23,000 rural distributors,"" Varun Berry, MD, Britannia Industries said during the company’s post-earnings call this week. Packaged foods company Capital Foods said it is stepping up last-mile delivery by partnering with stockists and distributors in focused regions as demand for its Schezwan Chutney, Ching's Hakka Noodles, sauces, etc grew across the country, including in tier 2 and 3 markets in the last year. “Following which there has been a strategic focus on expanding production capacity by adding manufacturing units and strengthening our distribution network across India,"" said Navin Tewari, MD and CEO, Capital Foods Pvt. Ltd. Snacking company Prataap Snacks recovered 96% of business in the December quarter on the back of better rural reach. “We have almost caught up with last year. That is primarily because we have penetrated deeper in smaller towns and rural"" said Subhashish Basu, chief operating officer at the Indore-based company. Basu said urban centres remain weak due to restrictions on colleges and schools. The company is further deepening reach in rural pockets. “It will help us to create some cushion for the shortfalls we're getting from the top urban centers,"" said Basu."

The company’s consolidated revenues increased by 5.8% year-on-year in Q3. This marks the second consecutive quarter of slower revenue growth. In the September quarter, Britannia’s revenue growth stood at nearly 11%. Recall that in the June quarter, its revenues had grown by a robust 26%. The firm had gained from the surge in at-home consumption. “Post unlocking, more snacking options became available and to that extent, the huge favour enjoyed by packaged foods players began to wane,"" said analysts from JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd in a report on 5 February. The broking firm added, “With schools, offices, railway services closed, on-the-go consumption of packaged products also did not return—these should get back to normal once citizens start to lead entirely normal lives, in our view."" According to Britannia, “Essentials were at elevated levels of demand at the beginning of the year due to pantry up-stocking, which has started to normalize with diversification of purchase basket of the consumers."" Even so, Britannia did well on profitability during the December quarter, thanks to better cost management. The upshot: earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin expanded by 249 basis points vis-à-vis last year to 19.3%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Improvement in Ebitda margin was driven by an uptick in gross profit margin, which expanded by 224 basis points. Further, other expenses as a percentage of operating revenues declined marginally as well. Overall, Ebitda increased by about 22% to ₹611 crore. Meanwhile, the Britannia stock trades at almost 44 times estimated earnings for financial year 2021-22, based on Bloomberg data. To be sure, near-term triggers for the Britannia stock appear limited. Higher year-on-year revenue growth (18%) for the half year ending September (H1FY21) means to that extent, the base becomes unfavourable in H1FY22. Small wonder, while shares of Britannia are about 9% above pre-covid highs seen in February 2020, they are also 11% lower compared to the annual highs seen on 20 July 2020."

State Bank of India: Reported a 6.9% year-on-year decline in its December quarter net profit to Rs5,1996 crore, as it made higher provisions for bad loans. Profit, however, topped the ₹4,850.5 crore average estimate of 15 analysts polled by Bloomberg. The lender lowered the guidance for FY21 credit growth to 7% from 8-9% announced it November. Reliance Industries: Has agreed to sell its entire stake in certain upstream assets in the Marcellus shale gas asset in south-western Pennsylvania in the US for $250 million amid a weakness in the global hydrocarbon market. The assets, controlled by RIL’s wholly-owned unit Reliance Marcellus LLC and operated by affiliates of EQT Corporation, will be sold to Northern Oil and Gas Inc. M&M: Will likely report double-digit growth in revenue and net profit for the December quarter, on the back of a robust increase in demand for its tractors and gradual recovery in passenger and commercial vehicle segment. A rise in input cost though could impact operating margins on a sequential basis. Bharti Airtel: Will raise up to ₹7,500 crore through debt instruments such as debentures and bonds in one or more tranches. The fundraising has been announced as the telecom companies prepare for the upcoming spectrum auction in March and the proposed rollout of 5G wireless service later this year. HCL Technologies: Has signed a five-year digital workplace services agreement with Airbus. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. As part of this, HCL will create a modernized digital workplace to enhance the user experience and service quality for a majority of Airbus employees globally. HPCL: State-run Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd reported an over three-fold rise in net profit to ₹2,355 crore for the December quarter against a net profit of ₹747 crore in the year-ago period. Revenue from operations, however, declined 2% year-on-year from ₹70,042.2 crore, but beat estimates. Private Banks: The 10 largest private sector banks in India have bad loans worth over ₹42,000 crore that are yet to be classified due to a court-ordered asset quality standstill, as per data compiled by Mint. While lenders have set aside ample provisions under the Reserve Bank of India’s guidelines, the loans, once classified, will add to the existing burden of NPAs on their books. FMCG stocks: As consumers in India’s top cities spend more time shopping for groceries online, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) makers are accelerating the launch of digital-first brands and rolling out more online specific stock keeping units. From organic honey and male grooming kits, to beverages and snacks, companies such as Marico Ltd, Dabur India Ltd and Hector Beverages are eyeing new launches.

One, the company operates in the packaged foods segment, which has lately benefited from the increase in stay-at-home consumption during the pandemic. Mrs Bectors operates in the premium and mid-premium range of biscuits and bakery segment in North India. Secondly, the issue comes at a time when the IPO market is performing well. On Monday, Burger King India Ltd saw a spectacular listing gain with the stock more than double from its issue price of ₹60. However, valuations are pricey, says Sachin Bobade, analyst at Dolat Capital Market Pvt. Ltd. The price band of Mrs Bectors issue is ₹286-288 per share. According to Bobade, “At ₹288, Mrs Bectors trades at 54 times FY20 earnings per share, 14% discount to Britannia Industries Ltd.""  Also read: Why Dalit students are facing a fund crunch in India’s educational institutions True, Mrs Bectors performed well in the half year ending September (H1FY21), backed by covid-19 tailwinds, making it an attractive proposition. Revenues increased by 18% year-on-year in H1FY21. Bigger peer, Britannia too saw about 19% year-on-year revenue growth in H1FY21. Mrs Bectors’ Ebitda margin expanded to 16.7% in H1FY21 compared to 12.2% in FY20. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. But the moot question is whether the good run will continue? As the impact of the pandemic wanes, it would be difficult for the company to sustain its robust margins and revenue growth seen in H1FY21. “Considering mere 1% market share in biscuit category and higher dependence on B2B business, we believe that the offer price is expensive,"" says Bobade. Even so, given that the general IPO market scene is bright and demand is strong going by the grey market premium, it is likely that Mrs Bectors shares may see decent listing gains as well. Coming to the financials, revenues in FY20 had declined by nearly 3% year-on-year. On the other hand, Britannia’s revenues had increased by 5%. Arun Kejriwal, founder of Kejriwal Research and Investment Services Pvt. Ltd, “Mrs Bectors’ relatively smaller size in terms of revenues compared to Britannia and Nestle means they are not fully comparable even though all these companies are in the packaged foods."" For perspective: Mrs Bectors revenues for FY20 stood at Rs762 crore and Britannia’s operating revenues were Rs11599 crore. Nestle’s revenues for the year ending December stood at Rs12370 crore. Kejriwal added, “Mrs Bector would have to grow fast and build capacity at a rapid pace to take advantage of the ever-growing market and command higher multiples like bigger peers."" Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd’s analysts said in a report on 14 December, “We believe Bread and Institutional Buns business is a silver lining (for Mrs Bector) given strong share and the credibility it provides to the system and processes from being a supplier to McDonald’s, KFC, Burger King and Rebel Foods.""

Updated: 10 Nov 2020,India beverages biz helps Tata Consumer brew a good Sep quarter,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/india-beverages-business-helps-tata-consumer-brew-a-good-september-quarter-11605008908471.html,"Tea has been comforting Indians during the pandemic, or so it appears from Tata Consumer Products Ltd’s September-quarter results. The company, which is a beneficiary of the rise in at-home consumption, had seen consolidated revenue growth of 13% year-on-year during the June quarter. Growth has further improved to 18.5% in Q2 on the back of robust performance of domestic beverage segment, revenues from which grew by 32%. The segment saw better realizations driven by higher tea prices and volume (up 11%). On the other hand, revenue growth from Tata Consumer’s international beverage business was slower at 7%. Revenue in the company’s domestic food business grew at 13% in Q2, down from 19% in Q1. To be sure, packaged foods company Britannia Industries Ltd saw a sharp revenue growth deceleration to 11% in the September quarter from 26.4% in the June quarter. In this backdrop, Tata Consumer’s performance appears better. While improved tea realizations helped boost overall revenues, higher tea prices did pose a risk to the company’s profitability for the quarter. After all, average domestic tea prices were up about 65% year-on-year. But the company managed well, restricting its consolidated gross profit margin contraction to about 270 basis points. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. A relatively slower pace of growth in employee costs, advertisement and sales charges, and other expenses boosted earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin, which expanded by 95 basis points to 14.4%. Post the results announcement on Friday evening, Tata Consumer’s shares closed marginally higher on Monday on the NSE. But, recall that the stock has seen a massive rally already. Currently, the shares are around 25% higher than pre-covid highs in February. Analysts from JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said, “Strictly speaking, we find the stock overvalued at 45 times one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio, especially since one-third of its revenue are from slow-growth international developed markets and another 10% are non-branded."" In a report on 8 November, the analysts said, “For now, however, the stock price could stay strong given that upgrades were still made to earnings forecasts, which came by on the back of good growth momentum in the overall business and expectations of further margin gains from acquisition synergies."" In the near term, domestic tea inflation remains a headwind. “While we have gained market share in tea and salt, navigating the unprecedented inflation in raw tea prices will be critical,"" said the company. It also remains to be seen whether the double-digit volume growth in the domestic beverage segment last quarter sustains. Nevertheless, valuations suggest investors haven’t woken up to these concerns yet."
Updated: 28 Oct 2020,"As virus changes consumer habits, FMCG firms see e-commerce business booming",https://www.livemint.com/industry/retail/as-virus-changes-consumer-habits-fmcg-firms-see-e-commerce-business-booming-11603844085935.html,"Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are seeing a surge in contribution of e-commerce to their overall sales as the pandemic has led more households to buy groceries online. Hindustan Unilever Ltd, the country’s top FMCG company, said the share of online retail to its total sales volume is close to 6%, rising from 3% in 2019. E-commerce sales at Nestle India Ltd surged 97% in the September quarter, comprising 4% of its local business. Packaged foods company Britannia Industries also said that its e-commerce sales have grown very “aggressively"" in the September quarter even as modern trade sales have been slow to catch up. “E-commerce has been a growth accelerator for us. Today, e-commerce has actually doubled from where it was pre-covid. It’s a shade under 6% in terms of our business and the growth rates have also doubled,"" Srinivas Phatak, chief financial officer, Hindustan Unilever, said last week after HUL’s earnings call. The maker of Surf Excel detergent and Dove soaps has been beefing up its e-comme-rce capabilities over the years. India’s FMCG trade is still dominated by millions of traditional mom-and-pop stores, despite the latest surge in online retail. Online sales have a minuscule 3% share, market researcher Nielsen said in a September report. The share is, however, more in metros. Packaged beverage company Parle Agro said it has seen “unprecedented growth in the segment"" as the supply squeeze prompted consumers to place online orders. “A lot of people who resisted adopting e-commerce as a platform to buy from had no choice because of the supply situation, or the number of stores open or even because the fear of going out was so high. So, most people started depending on e-commerce,"" said Nadia Chauhan, joint managing director and chief marketing officer, Parle Agro, which sells Frooti and Appy Fizz beverages. The curbs put in place to contain the spread of coronavirus and consumer worries about venturing into physical stores is fuelling the growth of online retail, with a lot of people ordering goods online for the first time. For FMCG firms, personal care categories helped get new consumers online, according to Nielsen. “It’s a very profitable part of the business and every company is treating this as the most important vertical from a medium-to-long term perspective, because if you can grow your market share here, obviously your pan-India market share will improve as e-commerce grows. Though it is 2-5% for every FMCG company, in the long term it will be in double digits,"" said Abneesh Roy, senior vice-president, research, Edelweiss Securities."

Updated: 19 Oct 2020,FMCG Q2 earnings to help gauge demand direction,https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/fmcg-q2-earnings-to-help-gauge-demand-direction-11603076219017.html,"India’s top fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are set to announce their September quarter earnings that will give a peek into which way consumption demand is headed in millions of Indian households after the blow from the coronavirus pandemic. Analysts expect rural growth to march ahead of urban. The easing of the lockdown and resumption of supplies to the market are expected to aid recovery of some personal care products and continue to benefit those that rely on in-home consumption. But demand for more discretionary items could remain weak. Packaged foods company Britannia Industries Ltd is set to announce its earnings this week followed by India’s top FMCG company Hindustan Unilever Ltd that acts as a bellwether for India’s household consumption. “Major trends in Q2FY21 include normalization of in-home food consumption and revival of skin care. Overall, we expect demand sentiments to continue to improve aiding the sector’s revenue growth in H2FY21,"" said analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a report. For Q2, the brokerage expects FMCG firms it tracks to post a year-on-year average volume growth of 1.3%, compared to a dip of 20.2% in the first quarter. It estimates revenue growth of 4.2% for the quarter, with year-on-year Ebitda growth of 3.8%in Q2FY21 compared to 15.5% and 26.6% year-on-year contraction in Q1FY21. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is a measure of profitability. India’s lockdown in late March severely dented FMCG distribution and manufacturing. While demand for health and hygiene products and packaged foods grew heavily, other categories such as personal care and on-the-go foods and beverages suffered. In fact, April and May were the worst for FMCG makers due to restrictions on store openings and many households had stockpiled provisions in March in anticipation of the lockdown. As a result, the April-June quarter witnessed a 17% decline in sales by value as compared with the same quarter of 2019, market researcher Nielsen said. For the full year, it lowered its growth forecast for the sector to between 1% and -1%. However, demand and supply have since improved. Nielsen reported demand for FMCG products neared pre-covid levels in June, but again fell in August. “Following a good Rabi crop yield and sharp increase in government allocation toward MGNREGA , the outlook for rural consumption is getting better due to good monsoons and record high Kharif crop sowing,"" Motilal Oswal said. They project flat sales for FMCG firms in Q2 after two quarters of decline in year-on-year sales and Ebitda. Those projected to benefit include businesses hinged on in-home consumption, along with those that have a significant part of their sales coming from hygiene products, staples and illness prevention (herbal products). On an aggregate level, the brokerage expects a 0.5% growth in quarterly sales."

ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Nestle, SBI and GAIL were among the top gainers on the Nifty, while Divis Labs, Eicher Motors, Hero MotoCorp, Cipla and Bajaj Auto dragged. Pharma, IT, media, and auto stocks were, however, under pressure. HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Bajaj Finance were the most traded on the BSE. BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices rose 0.5% each.   After opening with a gap, the Nifty did not do much thereafter. We moved in a 50-70 point range.

Equitas Small Finance Bank IPO is set to open on Tuesday and aims to raise ₹518 crore. Interestingly, the IPO was expected to be around ₹1,000 crore which was to be completed before September 2019 end as per RBI directives.

However, the Covid-19 derailed those plans again and now finally it is tapping the markets. 25% of the book comes from the highly risky microfinance sector. Considering the rise in NPA across the whole industry due to the fallout of Covid-19, we advise investors to be careful. The true picture of the loans will only be known by March 2021 and until then we advise to stick only to the strongly capitalized lenders. A few well-diversified banks are available below the book value and therefore it makes little to no sense to look at a smaller riskier lender. Therefore we have a avoid on the IPO.   Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said necessary changes are being made in every sector to ensure growth and to make this decade India's, the Press Trust of India reported. He also said that efforts are being made at all levels to make the country a global hub for higher education and its youth competitive.

""...A close below 11600 would apply brakes on the recent optimism and we may then see some extended correction in the market. Till then there is no reason to worry as we may see markets resuming the strength beyond 11850-11900 to surpass the 12000 mark convincingly. In the week gone by, we witnessed some sectoral shift in the market in the second half. The recent outperforming IT space had seen some decent profit booking along with Reliance; whereas on the other side, the banking which was considered to be a laggard has shown some serious strength to support the market. Hence going ahead, if Nifty has to resume the uptrend, the banking clearly plays a vital role in this.

The index has a good support at 11650 and until we do not break that, we are in positive territory. The resistance on the upside is at 12050.

Updated: 13 Oct 2020,FMCG firms to see noticeable recovery in Q2 with Britannia leading the pack,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/fmcg-firms-to-see-noticeable-recovery-in-q2fy21-britannia-to-lead-again-11602583520576.html,"Consumer staples firms were among the least affected during the June quarter, despite the covid-19 lockdown. In fact, packaged food companies thrived as stay-at-home consumption increased. For the September quarter as well, the growth momentum at Britannia Industries Ltd and Tata Consumer Products Ltd (TCPL) is expected to sustain. In the case of Britannia, the company is likely to dish out another good quarter even as some moderation from the June quarter is anticipated. “Britannia should continue to lead in revenue and earnings growth, riding on increased home consumption despite sequential moderation,"" said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a 12 October report. It expects Britannia to post a 15% y-o-y revenue growth. Of course, that’s a deceleration from the neat 26.4% growth seen in the June quarter. “Organic revenue growth rates for home and personal care and foods group (+6.2%) are expected to be the best seen in past six quarters."" analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd wrote in a 9 October report. “That is better than growth seen even prior to the pandemic setting in - aided by packaged foods (Britannia, TCPL) and GCPL (high single-digit growth in India, Africa)."" Analysts estimate Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) to report a decent recovery. In its September quarter update, GCPL said that it expects domestic business to deliver close to low double-digit y-o-y sales growth this quarter, led by the hygiene (including soap) and household insecticides categories. For the largest FMCG company, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), expectations are low. JM Financial analysts said, “HUL is expected to be more tepid with organic growth of about 2% due to continued pressure in out-of-home and some personal products segments."" Even so, reported growth would look better aided by the GSK Consumer merger. Marico Ltd’s September quarter performance is likely to show a good recovery. On the other hand, ITC Ltd’s cigarette business is expected to be under pressure even as its FMCG segment should do well. On the profitability front, savings on ad expenses had boosted Ebitda margins of many FMCG firms in the June quarter. In the September quarter, advertising expenses are projected to rise sequentially. “Although aggregate y-o-y spends should still be lower. Further, acute cost focus, seen in the June quarter, is likely to reverse, although y-o-y should see an increase. Ebitda margin should marginally expand year-on-year, therefore,"" point out Jefferies’ analysts. Meanwhile, analysts reckon that valuations of many FMCG firms are not cheap.
