Updated: 03 Jul 2022,Maruti Suzuki plans to deploy hybrid technology across all models in next 5 yrs,https://www.livemint.com/auto-news/maruti-suzuki-plans-to-deploy-hybrid-technology-across-all-models-in-next-5-yrs-11656834962377.html,"Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) plans to have strong hybrid technology across its model range in the next 5-7 years. The auto major aims to have strong and mild hybrid technologies as part of an initiative to have environment-friendly technology elements in each of its models, enabling better fuel efficiency and reduced carbon footprint. Battery electric vehicles, CNG cars and greater focus on ethanol and bio-CNG compliant engines would also be prioritised going ahead. MSI Chief Technical Officer C V Raman said that in the next five to seven years, every model will have some element of green technology or the other, adding that there will be no pure petrol powertrain across the range. Meanwhile, a senior official from MSI also informed that the country's largest carmaker is planning to invest around ₹18,000 crore on a new manufacturing facility in Haryana. The new plant is expected to replace the company's Gurugram-based facility and is likely to have an installed production capacity of 7.5-10 lakh units per annum. According to news agency PTI, MSI Chairman confirmed the company's ₹18,000 crore investment plan and said that the company had always planned to shift the Gurugram facility to a nearby location. He however declined to share details about the location finalised by the company. The auto major however remains wary of the state's new policy that has mandated 75 per cent job reservation for the locals in business and factory establishments. The company has been in talks with the state government but the issue remains unresolved, he added. When asked about the timeline for starting the project, Bhargava said, ""We don't know yet, can't say right now."" He, however, stated that the production capacity of the plant would be 7.5 -10 lakh units per annum depending upon the market growth in India. MSI announced that it has decided to shift its Gurugram plant, which is spread over 300 acres, because of congestion and traffic hassles. The plant, which is the company's first in the country, falls around residential areas. It is where the company began its India journey in 1983 by rolling out its first model -- the iconic Maruti 800. Amid rapid development in Gurugram, the company now finds its plant in the middle of a bustling city that has made the movement of trucks carrying raw materials and finished products in and out of the plant difficult. Local residents and authorities want the issue of congestion due to the plant to be addressed. Currently, the Gururgam plant rolls out many of the company's popular models, including Alto and WagonR, with an estimated annual capacity of around 7 lakh units. Besides Gurugram, MSI has another manufacturing unit in Haryana at Manesar. Both these units have combined production capacity of about 15.5 lakh units per annum. With an installed production capacity of 7.5 lakh units per year, its parent Suzuki Motor Corp has also set up a facility in Gujarat after the third unit started production in April this year."

Updated: 29 Jun 2022,Why Toyota-Suzuki stands a better chance than the auto marriages of the past,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/why-toyota-suzuki-stands-a-better-chance-than-the-auto-marriages-of-the-past-11656493986270.html,"Auto majors Toyota and Suzuki have announced plans for deepening their collaboration in India. The partnership of almost two years stands out, as tie-ups between auto companies invariably end up on the chopping board. Cracks start to appear within two or three years. The sector has a history of divorces following short honeymoons: Ford-Mahindra; Tata Motors-Volkswagen (the joint venture stalled and was called off before take-off); Mahindra-Renault and so on. In Toyota-Suzuki’s case, however, the relationship has been growing stronger and deeper in defiance of the history of car-makers’ demonstrated record of finding it hard to blend cultures of manufacturing and business alliances over the long term. The net outcome of the marriage between Toyota and Suzuki could prove to be an automotive landmark. What’s different about the Toyota-Suzuki dalliance? For one, there’s a crystal-clear business case for who brings what to the table. Suzuki (Maruti) is the undisputed market champ in India in terms of revenue, with proven expertise in two distinct domains: lightweight manufacturing and small cars. Toyota, on the other hand, is revered in Japan, where it is the number one maker of cars, and an established leader in hybrid and electric automotive technology; its hybrid car, Prius, has been around for 25 years.     "
Updated: 27 Jun 2022,Maruti Suzuki bets on hybrids over electric vehicles in clean shift,https://www.livemint.com/auto-news/maruti-suzuki-bets-on-hybrids-over-electric-vehicles-in-clean-shift-11656299876616.html,"Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., the automaker that sells every other car on the nation’s roads, believes electric vehicles aren’t the answer to reducing carbon emissions in the world’s third-biggest releaser of greenhouse gases -- at least not in the immediate future. India’s largest automaker reckons that vehicles powered by hybrid technology, natural gas and biofuels present a better path toward a cleaner future than electric cars considering the nation generates about 75% of its electricity from dirty coal, Chairman R.C. Bhargava said in an interview.  “Talking about electric cars without looking at the greenness of the electricity generated in the country is an inadequate approach to this problem,"" Bhargava said in an interview from his home in Delhi last week. “Until the time we have a cleaner grid power, it’s necessary to use all the available technologies like compressed natural gas, ethanol, hybrid and biogas, which will help reduce the carbon footprint and not push any one technology."" Those views put Bhargava at odds somewhat with several of the world’s largest car manufacturers, including No. 2 player Volkswagen AG, which is forecast to unseat Tesla Inc. as the leading maker of electric cars as soon as 2024. Toyota Motor Corp., which sells the most cars globally, is putting a lot of money into electrifying its line up too but believes in hybrid technology as a logical interim step while the industry builds out stable battery supply chains. India’s shift to electric vehicles is also much slower than other major markets like China and the US even though Prime Minister Narendra Modi has committed to making the South Asian nation a net-zero carbon emitting one by 2070. Arthur D. Little estimates by 2030, electric passenger cars will make up only about 5% of total EV sales. More progress on the two- and three-wheeler front will bring the automobile battery-powered total to about one-third. Charging EVs with clean energy and reducing dependence on coal is difficult in India, the world’s second-most populous country with some 1.4 billion people. The nation was forced to import millions of tons of coal after electricity demand soared amid scorching summer temperatures and rising industrial activity after the pandemic. Maruti plans to launch its first hybrid car under a partnership between its parent Suzuki Motor Corp. and Toyota within 12 months, Bhargava said. Hybrid cars are also a better alternative than EVs given India lacks adequate charging infrastructure, he said.  Maruti will additionally move “aggressively"" into cars that run on compressed natural gas because they’re cleaner than petrol or diesel models and cheaper than EVs, making them a viable option for low-income consumers who want to upgrade from a two-wheeler, he said. Although compressed natural gas is a fossil fuel, it’s one of the cleanest burning in terms of emissions. As the availability of chips improves, Maruti expects to sell 600,000 compressed natural gas cars in the year ending March 2023 versus 230,000 units the previous fiscal year. Maruti currently has nine compressed natural gas models and is planning to introduce more such variants. Using biofuels to power passenger cars is another alternative, however the investment to make it commercially viable is lacking, Bhargava said. There are problems with biofuels also, with their prolonged use in cars potentially extremely harmful to the planet’s limited farmland. India currently blends gasoline with 10% ethanol, which is largely derived from sugarcane, while roughly two-fifths of America’s corn and soybean crops end up burned in engines. Indonesia’s expected consumption of 10 billion liters of biodiesel this year will use up almost a quarter of its palm oil crop. But India does have a big advantage when it comes to generating biogas, considering it has the largest cattle population in the world and the chief raw material for biogas is cattle dung, Bhargava said. Maruti is working with the government and oil companies to boost the production of biogas, he said, adding that the government should give incentives for its production and create vendor development projects to improve the collection, transport and storage of dung from villages. Developing cleaner alternatives will mean Maruti and its suppliers will have to bolster their engineering capabilities, Bhargava said. Maruti plans to hire more engineers, he said, declining to specify the percentage of manpower expansion. “EVs are not going to be a large part of car sales, irrespective of what other manufacturers are saying or planning,"" Bhargava said. “The ability to get green transportation is going to take time in India because of the nature of our electricity generation.""

Nifty 50 index dipped 331 points and closed at 15,360 levels while BSE Sensex crashed 1045 points and closed at 51,495 mark. Nifty Bank index ended 721 points lower at 32,617 levels. BSE small-cap and mid-cap indices fell 2.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively, under-performing the Nifty. Global stock markets fell Thursday as fears of a recession grew after the Federal Reserve's biggest rate hike in nearly three decades and the Swiss National Bank raised its policy interest rate for the first time in 15 years in a surprise move on Thursday. According to stock market experts, a long bear candle was formed on the daily chart after opening higher. This candle has broken decisively below the important support band of 15,700 to 15,600 levels and closed lower. This downside breakout of the support could hint more downside for the market ahead and any upside bounce from here could be a sell on rise opportunity.

One may expect Nifty to slide down to the next lows of around 15,000 to 14,800 in the near term. Any upside bounce from here could be a sell on rise opportunity."" Expecting pullback from short term support levels, Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com said, ""The momentum readings on the lower time frame chart has reached the oversold zone and hence, a pullback move could be seen from the short term supports in the near term. But until there’s change in data or the structure, the trend remains bearish. The immediate supports for Nifty are placed around 15,270 and 15,080 and because the readings on lower time chart are oversold, a pullback can be seen from these levels.

Over the years we have consciously increased the share of car dispatches from our factory to dealers using railways,"" MSI Executive Director Rahul Bharti told PTI news agency From around 66,000 units in 2014-15, it has reached an all-time high of 2.33 lakh units in 2021-22, he noted. ""To further increase the share, we are taking several steps. As an industry first initiative, we have formed joint ventures with the governments of Gujarat and Haryana to set-up in-plant railway sidings at Hansalpur and Manesar manufacturing plants,"" Bharti said. Realising the environmental benefits, the auto major said it has worked with Indian Railways to increase the use of rail transport for vehicle dispatch. MSI was the country's first automobile manufacturer to obtain an Automobile Freight Train Operator (AFTO) license in 2013. This license allowed the company to fabricate and operate high-speed, high-capacity auto-wagon rakes on the Indian Railways network. The company has 41 railway rakes, with a capacity of over 300 vehicles per rake. Currently, Maruti Suzuki utilises six loading terminals across Delhi-NCR and Gujarat (Gurgaon, Farukhnagar, Kathuwas, Patli, Detroj and Chharodi) and 16 destination terminals (Bangalore, Nagpur, Mumbai, Guwahati, Mundra Port, Indore, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Farukhnagar, Siliguri, Coimbatore, Pune, Agartala and Silchar). With the addition of Agartala (in 2019) and Silchar (in 2021), cars dispatched for North-Eastern states now reach in nearly eight days. (With PTI inputs)"
Updated: 01 Jun 2022,"Reconsider '6 airbags must' proposal; norm to hit small car market, jobs: Maruti",https://www.livemint.com/auto-news/maruti-wants-govt-to-reconsider-proposal-to-make-6-airbags-must-in-cars-says-norm-to-hit-small-car-market-jobs-11653995837464.html,"The government should reconsider the proposal to make six airbags mandatory in passenger vehicles, auto major Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) said, adding that the norm will adversely hit the already shrinking small car market and may even impact jobs in the auto sector going ahead. Maruti said the regulation would largely impact the cost-sensitive entry-level car segment, which has been facing headwinds and witnessing dwindling sales over the last three years, making it even more difficult for two-wheeler users to upgrade to small cars.  Earlier this year, the road transport ministry said it will make it mandatory for carmakers to provide a minimum of six airbags in motor vehicles that can carry up to 8 passengers for enhanced safety of occupants from October 2022. In an interaction with PTI, MSI Chairman RC Bhargava said the cost of the entry-level cars has already gone up considerably due to the implementation of various regulatory norms in the past few years, including the BSVI emission regime from April 1 2020. 'Sales of small cars impacted in non-metro markets' With prices going up, the sales of small cars have been impacted especially in the non-metro markets across the country, the veteran industry leader noted. He cautioned that with the implementation of the six airbag regulation the prices will further go up leading to further shrinking of the domestic small car industry. ""So, the fear is that due to this (six airbags) the market will become smaller. The car manufacturing sector is important because it is a big creator of employment. When the car sells in the market it creates many jobs -- drivers, maintenance, repairs, accessories etc,"" Bhargava stated. He added: ""If the car market does not grow like what has been happening in the last three years it will have an adverse effect on job creation and economic growth"". When asked how much the price of cars could go up due to the addition of airbags, Bhargava said: ""I am not sure but it could be in the range of ₹20,000-25,000, which for a small car buyer is a lot of money"". Bhargava noted that there were not many countries across the globe, which may have implemented such a regulation. ""I think, we will be among the first countries to do that...so we in the industry think that it is not the right time to bring six airbag regulations. We would like the government to reconsider this matter,"" Bhargava said. While acknowledging that airbags do help save lives in case of road accidents, Bhargava noted that the cost increase due to the regulation will, however, deter many driving two-wheelers to upgrade to entry-level cars. ""Driving a two-wheeler is any day more unsafe than driving a car. So, overall fatalities due to car accidents may come down..whereas the chances of fatalities in the two-wheeler may go up. So, overall if there is benefit in all of this, it is a matter of pondering,"" he stated. The matter needs to be seen in totality, Bhargava noted. He stated that the impact on small cars is more compared to bigger cars when the cost goes up. ""So, that is what has happened and now, we will have this extra cost again of additional airbags, so the industry has expressed a view that the market will become further smaller for the small cars,"" Bhargava said. He noted that with a hit on the affordability factor, small car offtake is shrinking in the smaller cities, towns and rural areas while the market for expensive cars in urban centres was going up across the country. Understanding the additional airbags mandate for cars From 1 April, 2019, several safety features became mandatory, which includes a driver-side airbag. Passenger airbag was mandatory from 1 January, 2022. The government says the airbags will ensure the safety of passengers across all segments, irrespective of the cost/variant of the vehicle. While this may be true but the additional airbags are expected to increase the costs of cars by around ₹50,000. According to the latest government data, a total of 1,16,496 road accidents occurred on national highways (NHs), including expressways, in 2020, causing 47,984 deaths. For some cars that do not offer side and curtain airbags in any variants will require changes to the body shell as well as to the interior trim and fittings to ensure that the airbags deploy safely and effectively. This would further increase the cost of vehicles. Airbag count in other nations Back in 1988, the US passed a Federal law, which made a driver airbag compulsory for all cars sold in the country. In 1998, the US passed a law that required all cars and light trucks sold in the United States have airbags on both sides of the front seats.  Till date, there is no law that enforces six airbags as standard, although in most developed, highly industrialised countries, average car safety levels are much higher than they are in India. According to German mobility magazine Bubgeldkatalog, airbags are not mandatory by law in Germany. Although not must, almost all new vehicles are equipped with a minimum of one airbag, especially small.  "

Recently, the company’s chairman R.C. Bhargava said there was no more “butter"" in this segment, with only bread left behind. Why are small car sales falling? Mint explains: What role has inflation played in the matter? The first thing to understand is that the entire ‘entry-level’ segment itself is getting reconstituted and redefined. Prices of vehicles have gone up by up by 15-20% in the last one year alone, as automakers passed on the costs of implementing new BS-VI emissions standards, of introducing additional features in cars, and of buying costlier raw materials and precious metals. The magnitude of this increase has been felt most sharply in the lower-priced models, which has made a new car fall out of budget for a lot of first-time buyers, who typically seek to buy an entry-level model. Is it about income distress? The economic recovery that India has seen after two devastating waves of covid-19 is unevenly spread. While income levels showed resilience at the top of the pyramid, populations at its bottom were rendered more vulnerable. “There is a different elasticity of demand in different segments. The entry-level segment is much more price-sensitive when the price of acquisition goes up,"" Shashank Srivastava, executive director, Maruti Suzuki, told Mint in an earlier interview, adding that negative sentiments among buyers have had a disproportionately negative effect on new purchases of big-ticket items such as cars.

Sales volumes in April fell by 6% year-on-year (y-o-y), which was worse than expected. Semiconductor shortage, because of which the automaker could not produce about 270,000 units in FY22, would have a mild impact on production in FY23, the company said in the March quarter (Q4FY22) earnings call. Less production, low margin (at 6.5%), and higher working capital meant negative free cash flow in FY22.        "

The Suzuki Motor Corp. unit posted a net profit of ₹1,838.9 crore in the three months ended 31 March, despite challenges posed by rising input costs and semiconductor chip shortages impacting production and sales volumes. The figure surpassed the ₹14,800 crore estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Vehicle sales fell 0.7% in the quarter to 488,830 units. Sales in the domestic market fell 8% from a year ago to 420,376 units, while exports surged nearly 93% to a record 68,454 vehicles. Maruti posted an operating profit of ₹1,779.6 crore in the March quarter, a 42% increase from a year earlier and 95% from the preceding three months, as the automaker recorded net sales growth of 11% from a year earlier and 15% sequentially to ₹25,514 crore. Improvement in the operating performance came from cost reduction efforts, lower sales promotion expenses, an increase in selling prices and higher non-operating income. Overall, the company’s financial performance surpassed market expectations. “Maruti Suzuki delivered a strong performance in 4QFY22 with Ebitd margin coming in at 9.1%, 100bps above our estimate of 8.1%,"" said Mitul Shah, head of research at Reliance Securities Ltd. However, chip availability and rising commodity costs will pose challenges for Maruti. Semiconductor shortages meant Maruti’s pending orders of about 268,000 vehicles by the end of March crossed 300,000 vehicles now, chairman R.C. Bhargava said in a conference call with reporters. To be sure, the challenge for Maruti is also the shrinking market for entry-level cars. During FY22, the company’s small and compact car sales fell 3% to 916,643 units. However, sales of mid-size sedans and utility vehicles grew 15% and 27% to 15,869 units and 290,701 units, respectively. Bhargava said the proportion of price increases of entry-level small cars has been much more than higher-end cars, which is a key reason behind the shrinking market for small cars. Still, the small car segment remains the biggest volume driver for the company. Meanwhile, Maruti expects to introduce a wider range of new vehicle models this fiscal as it seeks to keep its market leadership. Investors will, however, be watchful on the pace of sport-utility vehicle launches and progress in the electric vehicle space. While the company plans to launch EVs starting in 2025, Bhargava emphasized that Maruti is also focusing on hybrid vehicles. The company’s management also expects strong traction in the export markets to continue, supporting its overall volumes. In addition, the underpenetrated rural market also offers opportunities, and improving prosperity levels in rural India should help sales volume. Overall, analysts expect the sales of premium products to further increase at Maruti going forward. The company will also enjoy the benefit of a higher market share in CNG variants, as the preference for CNG vehicles has been rising."

The company plans to launch its first EV model in 2025. To start with, the first EV will be rolled out from Suzuki Motor Gujarat's plant. “We are a little behind our competitors in introducing the (EV) model to the Indian market, but we see that still, the market demand for those EVs is limited.

He further said, ""We have done a very extensive test of our EV utilising our existing models and putting those batteries and motors and everything into this existing model. We have been doing this test for more than a year with multiple cars in the Indian environment so that we are sure that our EV technology will be good in the environment, which is very, very tough in India,"" PTI quoted.

Updated: 11 Apr 2022,Ford’s shuttered India factories may be reborn in EV push,https://www.livemint.com/auto-news/fords-shuttered-india-factories-may-be-reborn-in-ev-push-11649678885377.html,"It’s been seven months since Ford decided to shut its factories in India, taking a $2 billion charge for the retreat. The decision was unsurprising: contrary to Ford’s expectation in 2012 that the nation’s burgeoning middle class would propel it to one of the company’s top three markets by 2020, its market share had slumped to less than 1.5% by the time it decided to pull the pin. In between, Ford invested heavily in two factories near the southern and western coasts of India, manufacturing cars and SUVs for both the domestic market and export. But it racked up losses of more than $2 billion in a decade, unable to crack a price-conscious market dominated by cheap cars and two-wheelers. Now, there could be a way to recoup at least some of those losses. The provincial government in Tamil Nadu is holding talks with Ford to explore if its factory there can be converted to a plant manufacturing and exporting electric vehicles, the Economic Times newspaper reported last week. Ford also told the newspaper it was “exploring the possibility of using a plant in India as an export base."" That could very well turn out to be a smart move. While it’s difficult for U.S. carmaking giants to make any meaningful inroads in India — General Motors ceased sales in India five years ago — EVs could offer another opportunity to take a shot in the market of 1.4 billion people.  That option is particularly promising given Maruti Suzuki, the local unit of Suzuki that sells one in every two cars on Indian roads, doesn’t offer a single EV.  The market is tiny, at just 1% of total sales, but the growth is staggering. Retail sales of electric cars and SUVs jumped 324% last month, based on data compiled by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association. That compares with a fall of 7.8% in overall sales of passenger vehicles.  India, home to some of the world’s most-polluted cities, has vowed to turn carbon-neutral by 2070, and is taking steps to become greener. Ford is among companies selected to receive state subsidies under a production-linked plan for electric vehicles, incentivizing the carmaker to possibly return with a new avatar.  That may hold lessons for other automakers too. GM’s factory in India has sat idle for years, with a labor union representing former workers blocking a deal to sell the plant to China’s Great Wall Motors. Ford has brought some very successful products to India — like the Figo hatchback, the EcoSport compact SUV, and the Endeavour premium SUV. But it’s difficult to compete with Maruti and South Korea’s Hyundai in the nation, where bare-bones cheap cars are traditionally chosen by an emerging middle class buying their first vehicle.  There are signs that’s changing, especially with premium models. Mercedes-Benz plans to roll out a locally assembled EQS — the electric version of its flagship S-Class sedan — this year, while BMW is also unveiling a slew of electric products in India. Elon Musk has waged an unsuccessful campaign for the government to cut import tariffs so Tesla can enter the market.  But Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s focus is clear. Under a program called Make-in-India, he wants automakers to set up factories in India to sell locally and export. That’s where Ford’s opportunity lies. "

In news from the automobile sector, Maruti Suzuki is looking at producing more than half a million CNG-powered vehicles in the upcoming financial year amid growing consumer preference triggered by a sharp increase in the price of motor fuels. The country’s largest carmaker has firmed up plans to produce 600,000 CNG vehicles in fiscal 2023 which is more than half of a million CNG vehicles it has sold in the local market cumulatively in the last two decades. The company clocked the milestone of registering cumulative sales of 1 million CNG vehicles earlier this week on Tuesday. The company’s chairman R C Bhargava said that until electric vehicles (EVs) become mainstream, it’s important to look at alternative fuels to reduce carbon emissions. CNG emits 20% less CO2 than petrol. In fact, bio CNG is carbon negative. Lower prices (of CNG) make it a very good option, especially for small car buyers. In the current fiscal year itself, Maruti Suzuki expects CNG sales to expand nearly 50% to 235,000-240,000 units. The company has pending orders for an additional 115,000 units. Maruti Suzuki share price is currently trading up by 1.4%. Moving on to news from the EV space, Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday expressed optimism about the adoption of electric and alternative fuel-powered vehicles, saying the scenario will change in the next five years. The Union Road Transport and Highways minister stated while answering a question in the Rajya Sabha, that sales of petrol and diesel vehicles will fall day by day while that of electric and alternate fuel-powered vehicles will increase. He cited an example that if a customer has to choose between an EV and a petrol car where the cost is same at ₹15 lakh, with fuel cost of ₹50,000 (petrol) and ₹2,000 (for EV) then one would go for a more economical option. The minister dismissed the issue of lack of EV charging infrastructure and stated that the day will come in a year when EV charging arrangement will be everywhere including in all offices. The minister acknowledged that battery cost is a major challenge. Presently lithium ion is a big challenge. We don't have lithium ion. About 81% batteries we manufacture here in India. Now lithium ion is available in the world. Government is in the process to acquire some mines. We will keep you updated on the latest developments from this space. Stay tuned. Speaking of EVs, have a look at the chart below which shows the massive opportunity in the two-wheeler EVs. Here’s what lead Smallcap Analyst at Equitymaster, Richa Agarwal wrote about this in a recent edition of Profit Hunter: In the last five years, two-wheeler sales in India were around 2 crore units per year. Now the sector is cyclical and has been in the downturn for some time. So let's consider a moderate 5% growth for the next 10 years. By 2030, we are looking at 2-wheeler sales of 3 crore units. Even if one third of this is EV sales, that's 1 crore electric 2-wheelers per year. In the last 2 years, average electric 2-wheeler sales were 1.5 lakh units. From 1.5 lakh to 1 crore, that's a 66x opportunity in 2-wheeler EVs. This is an annual growth rate of 52% over next 10 years. It's an almost vertical growth opportunity.

The Nikkei slumped 0.8% while the Shanghai Composite zoomed 1.9%. The Hang Seng is down 0.3%. In US stock markets, Wall Street indices witnessed another bumpy ride on Friday with the Nasdaq recovering much of the ground it lost in the previous session, as Amazon's positive earnings capped a week of mixed big-tech numbers. The Dow Jones ended flat while the Nasdaq Composite rallied 1.6%. Back home, Indian share markets are trading on a negative note. Benchmark indices started on a muted note but fell as the session progressed, extending weakness from the previous session and tracking FII activity. Net-net, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have turned sellers of domestic stocks to the tune of ₹22.7 bn, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs turned net sellers to the tune of ₹6.2 bn, data suggests. FPIs took out ₹36.3 bn from equities during 1-4 February. Weak global cues amid surging US bond yields also dampened the sentiment. Market participants will track shares of PolicyBazaar, Tube Investments of India, Union Bank of India, TVS Motor Company, and Minda Industries as these companies will announce their December quarter results today. The BSE Sensex is trading down by 286 points. Meanwhile, the NSE Nifty is trading lower by 53 points. Hindalco and ONGC are among the top gainers today. Hero MotoCorp, on the other hand, is among the top losers today. The BSE Mid Cap index is up 0.2% while the BSE Small Cap index is trading higher by 0.4%. Sectoral indices are trading mixed with stocks in the IT sector and finance sector witnessing selling pressure. Realty stocks and oil & gas stocks, on the other hand, are trading in green.

Gold rose today as growing worries over broadening price pressures lifted the metal's appeal as an inflation hedge and helped cushion pressure from higher US Treasury yields after a surprisingly upbeat jobs report. Crude oil prices edged higher reversing earlier losses, as investors kept bullish sentiment on expectations that global supply would remain tight as demand picks up and shrugged off signs of progress in the US-Iran nuclear talks. In news from the power sector, NTPC is among the top buzzing stocks today. State-run power giant NTPC on Saturday said that its 74.88 MW power generation capacity is commercially operational at Fatehgarh Solar PV Project at Jaisalmer in Rajasthan. Here’s what the company said in an exchange filing, Consequent upon successful commissioning, second part capacity of 74.88 MW out of 296 MW Fatehgarh Solar PV Project at Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, is declared on Commercial Operation from 00:00 Hrs. of February 5, 2022. With this, commercial capacity of NTPC and NTPC group has become 54,377.30 MW and 67,832.30 MW respectively. Note that last week, NTPC delivered strong December quarter results with a 5% PAT outperformance led by better realisation. NTPC is expanding 1.3GW Talcher thermal (another 5.3GW under consideration) which will be based on carbon capture/Blue coal technology. The company’s management is confident of 15GW RE capacity by fiscal 2025 (7.5GW being implemented) - 40% capex mix towards RE. NTPC has a unique advantage of leveraging its thermal plants to blend RE and supply RTC power. NTPC share price is currently trading up by 0.2%. In other news from the power sector, Tata Power is in advanced talks with investors to raise as much as $600-700 m for the renewable energy business at an equity valuation of around $6-7 bn. The deal is at an advanced stage and is likely to be concluded in the coming weeks, as the salt-to-steel conglomerate looks to pare debt and strengthen its balance sheet ahead of a planned public issue of the alternate energy unit. Last year, Tata Power decided to club its entire renewables portfolio under an umbrella entity. This includes operating power assets in the pipeline, charging stations, rooftop solar, microgrids, panel manufacturing, engineering, procurement and construction. The company also had plans to go for an InVit. It had held negotiations with Malaysia’s Petronas for a potential investment of up to $2 bn, but the talks couldn’t culminate into a transaction. Tata Power has one of India's largest renewable energy businesses with an operating capacity of 2.6 GW comprising wind and solar in a 32:68 ratio spread across 11 states.

Moving on to news from the automobile sector, Maruti Suzuki is expecting production activity to improve in the current quarter with gradual improvement in the supply of critical electronic components. The country's largest carmaker is also looking at ways, including bolstering its SUV portfolio, in order to get back to 50% market share in the domestic passenger vehicle segment in the years ahead. The auto major’s cumulative market share is currently around 44% as it continues to struggle in the mid-size SUV segment. In an analyst call, the company had said an estimated 90,000 vehicles could not be produced during the third quarter owing to the global shortage of semiconductors mostly corresponding to the domestic models. At present, MSI has a cumulative production capacity of around 5.5 lakh units per quarter or about 22 lakh units per annum across its manufacturing plants in Haryana and Gujarat. Maruti Suzuki is sitting on a backlog of around 2.6 lakh units with CNG units comprising 1.17 lakh units. On a query related to the market share, the company said that it would be difficult to go over the 50% mark by the end of this fiscal due to production constraints.

The auto major is also looking at ways, including bolstering its SUV portfolio, in order to get back to 50 per cent market share in the domestic passenger vehicle segment in the years ahead. The company's cumulative market share currently hovers around 44 per cent as it continues to struggle in the mid-size SUV segment, which has been growing at a fast clip. ""An estimated 90,000 vehicles could not be produced during the third quarter owing to the global shortage of electronics components mostly corresponding to the domestic models. Though still unpredictable, the electronics supply situation is improving gradually. The company hopes to increase production in Q4, though it will not reach full capacity,"" Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) CFO Ajay Seth said in an analyst call. At present, MSI has a cumulative production capacity of around 5.5 lakh units per quarter or about 22 lakh units per annum across its manufacturing plants in Haryana and Gujarat. Seth noted that during the October-December quarter, the company continued to experience a shortage of electronic components, especially during the festive period, when the demand for cars usually remains good. ""The enquiry, bookings and retail sales in the third quarter have shown an improvement sequentially. Enablers such as finance availability and interest rates continue to remain favourable,"" Seth explained. Elaborating on the production scenario, MSI Senior Executive Director (Sales and Marketing) Shashank Srivastava stated that the situation has improved gradually from September last year when the company could only roll out 40 per cent of its manufacturing target. ""The situation in that sense is improving. However, it is still not 100 per cent as you can see, and we are hopeful in January, February and March, we will continue to see this improvement hopefully to be above that 90 per cent mark...we may not reach 100 per cent,"" he stated. Srivastava further said: ""When we will reach 100 per cent is actually not clear at the moment because we cannot take a definitive view on that because it's a very complex supply chain, which is involving not just Maruti Suzuki but all OEMs in India and not just India, but across the globe."" On a query related to the market share, he noted that it would be difficult for the company to go over the 50 per cent mark by the end of this fiscal due to production constraints. ""So if you look at the figure for December, the market share for wholesale was 48.3 per cent and for retail it was 49.9 per cent, very close to the 50 per cent mark. However, if you look at the cumulative figures so far for the year, the market share is just around 44 per cent. So, I think judging by that, it does appear that while December market share is close to 50, cumulatively it might be difficult to reach that 50 per cent at the end of the year given the current production scenario,"" Srivastava said. However, in the years forward, it is still quite feasible for the auto major to target 50 per cent market share, he added. Srivastava noted that the company continues to lead in the hatchbacks, MPV and van segments and it is only in the mid-size SUV segment that it lags behind the competition. ""If you look at our market share up till December, for hatches it is 67 per cent. If you look at the passenger cars, it is 62.5 per cent. If you see the MPVs where we have the XL6 and the Ertiga competing against Innova, Triber, etc, it is 64 per cent and for the vans it is 95.6 per cent. So obviously in all these segments, the company's market share being above 65 per cent or thereabouts. It's the SUV space which has pulled us down,"" he stated. In the entry SUV space, the company leads with the Vitara Brezza, Srivastava said. ""We have a weakness in the mid SUV segment currently. And we hope to address it going forward by expanding our portfolio in this very critical category,"" he noted. On the alternate technologies, Srivastava said that given the high upfront cost of batteries and the limited charging infrastructure network in the country, the automaker is of the view that at least for the medium-term hybrids will be a very powerful solution. ""They are scalable, they do about 40 per cent of the job of an electric vehicle (EV) in terms of CO2 reduction, in terms of energy efficiency, but they're probably 100 times scalable. So in the medium term, they will be a good option. And of course EVs also have to be pursued for the long term. So all options have to be worked upon,"" he stated. On the company's current order book, he said that the automaker was sitting on a backlog of around 2.6 lakh units with CNG units comprising 1.17 lakh units.

Total revenue from operations fell 1% to 232.46 billion rupees. The company hopes to increase production in the fourth quarter, though it would not reach full capacity.

""Production was constrained by a global shortage in the supply of electronic components because of which an estimated 90,000 units could not be produced,"" Maruti, majority owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp, said in a statement. The company said that there was no lack of demand as it had over 240,000 pending customer orders at the end of the third quarter. Raw material prices and shipping costs have also spiked due to supply chain disruptions, squeezing profit margins at companies looking to recover from the impact of the pandemic The company, which sells every second car in India, sold a total of 430,668 units during the December quarter, lower than 495,897 units in same period, previous year. Maruti Suzuki had earlier said it has increased prices of its models by up to 4.3% with immediate effect to partially offset the impact of the rise in input costs. The company has enhanced prices across its models in the range of 0.1% to 4.3% owing to increase in various input costs."

Updated: 14 Jan 2022,What’s Elon Musk’s tiff with Govt of India all about?,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/whats-elon-musk-s-tiff-with-govt-of-india-all-about-11642170101670.html,"The wunderkind of tech manufacturing, Elon Musk, wants India to lower import duty on his Tesla cars, so that these high-performance electric cars can begin to sell in India, the second-most populous country in the world and one of the fastest-growing economies in the medium term, and so a potentially attractive market for his company. Musk has been periodically tweeting, seeking a cut in import duty. On Thursday, he again tweeted. “Still working through a lot of challenges with the government"", he wrote in a post giving an update to a query on Twitter. The remark immediately drew a sharp retort from New Delhi. News reports have quoted unnamed official government sources saying that Tesla is free to use the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) window to produce electric vehicles in India. The businessman, these sources seem to suggest, seeks to pressure India into slashing import duties without offering any commitment to produce here. Major Indian automotive producers Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors and Mahindra are opposed to the idea of slashing import duties on automobiles. This is par for the course. But Tesla’s demand for lower import duties runs up against not just the obvious reluctance of local carmakers for aggravated competition but also settled government policy. The government has been championing indigenous manufacture vociferously. Make in India and Vocal for Local are some of the slogans accompanying such a policy preference. This policy seeks to favour an entire range of manufactured goods, on which import duties have been raised. For a select group of products, the government has also announced the PLI scheme, under which the government gives a cash incentive to producers who meet pre-committed production goals, in terms of volume and time. The hope here is that this policy will incentivize the creation of factory jobs. It is far from clear that the product mix or the policy mix is optimal; many experts have argued that it has not been possible to demonstrate that in the long run, such incentives deliver on the policy objectives. But the PLI scheme is in place now. A range of foreign companies is poised to reap large PLI benefits from the Indian state, because of their domestic manufacturing base.     "

The auto sector has been battling severe cost inflation, and as firms take price hikes, investors will closely watch how demand gets impacted. For now, the scenario is somewhat gloomy. In November, amid high expectations of the festive season driving sales recovery, auto sales numbers did disappoint a bit. Overall, sales data points to a mixed-demand trend in auto sales with the two-wheeler, passenger vehicle and tractor segments remaining weak. The only bright spot amid this was decent recovery in commercial vehicle sales. Analysts note that rural sales took a hit in November due to unfavourable factors such as delayed harvesting of kharif crops, keeping rural cash flows and retail sales muted. Further, chip shortages continue to limit the rebound in sales recovery for passenger vehicles (PV) and other segments.        "

Future Retail: Future Retail Ltd’s lenders are planning to discuss allegations of financial irregularities against the retailer and may initiate a forensic audit of the company’s books, two people aware of the development said. In a 24 November letter to the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India, Future Group’s partner Amazon.com Inc. alleged funds diversion in Future Retail, including unfair related-party transactions worth about $1 billion; a sudden spike in Future Retail’s debts; and an inordinate delay in payment to creditors due to discrimination by promoters.

Built with an investment of over ₹44 crores, the facility uses modern and advanced machines to dismantle and scrap ELVs in a scientific manner. Maruti Suzuki Toyotsu India Private Limited (MSTI) is a Joint Venture (JV) between Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Tsusho group. The group also intends to set up more such modern ELV scrap units and recycling centres in India. Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari inaugurated this government approved ELV scrapping and recycling unit. Nitin Gadkari, Hon’ble Minister of Road Transport and Highways, said, “Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has launched the visionary National Automobile Scrappage Policy aimed at creating an ecosystem for phasing out unfit and polluting vehicles from the Indian roads. To meet this objective, we need state-of-the-art scrapping and recycling units.""

Updated: 21 Nov 2021,Maruti to stay away from diesel segment; focus on making fuel efficient variants,https://www.livemint.com/auto-news/maruti-to-stay-away-from-diesel-segment-focus-on-making-fuel-efficient-variants-11637476843605.html,"Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) has ruled out getting back into the diesel segment as it believes sale of such vehicles would further come down with the onset of the next phase of emission norms in 2023, according to a senior company official. The country's largest carmaker believes the next phase of emission norms would jack up the cost of diesel vehicles, thus further impacting their sales in the market which for the last few years has seen a gradual shift towards petrol cars. ""We are not going to be in the diesel space. We had indicated earlier that we will study it and if there is customer demand we can make a comeback. But going forward, we will not be participating in the diesel space,"" MSI Chief Technical Officer C V Raman told PTI in an interaction. He cited the upcoming stricter emission norms as a primary reason to avoid diesel-powered cars. ""In 2023 the new phase of emission norms will come which is likely to drive up the cost. So we believe that diesel percentages may further come down. We do not know about the competition but as MSI we do not have any intention to participate in the diesel space,"" Raman noted. As per industry estimates, the share of diesel vehicles is currently less than 17 per cent of the overall passenger vehicle (PV) sales. It is a massive reduction from 2013-14 when diesel cars used to account for 60 per cent of the overall sales. Already many of the automakers in the country have junked diesel trims of their respective portfolios with the onset of the BS-VI emission regime from April 1, 2020. MSI had discontinued diesel models from its portfolio with the onset of the stricter BS-VI emission norms. The company's entire model range is currently powered by BS-VI compliant 1 litre, 1.2 litre and 1.5 litre gasoline engines. It also offers CNG trims across seven of its models. Raman said the company would focus on improving its existing petrol powertrains in terms of fuel efficiency and going ahead, may also look at a new family of engines to power its product portfolio. ""We have said that we will improve our existing powertrains which is already happening. The new K10-C engine in Celerio is one improvement. Similarly, the 1.2 litre engine has undergone some change. So from a fuel efficiency perspective, we will improve our internal combustion engine technology,"" he stated. As per the company, its recently introduced all-new version of Celerio returns a fuel efficiency of 26.68 km/litre, which it claims is the highest for any petrol-powered car in India. Raman said the company would also enhance electrification aspects in its cars like start-stop technology. ""We already have the mild hybrid technology at the higher end. Besides, we are propagating more CNG because of the low running cost. Seven out of 15 models already have the CNG trims. In future, more brands will come with the technology,"" he added. There would be hybrid technologies and electric vehicles (EVs) going ahead, so there is going to be a lot of change from powertrain perspective, Raman noted. Commenting on other alternate fuels, he said the company already is ethanol 10 per cent (E10) compliant and as per the fuel availability, 2023 onwards E20 will be made available. ""So we will also make all our vehicles compliant to E20 from 2023. In terms of flex fuels, yes we will study, but there are issues in terms of fuel availability. ""We are not very sure about when it will be available and its pricing as well. But we will obviously study that. Such engines require certain lead time for development and customer acceptance is also a factor,"" Raman said. He noted that the company is aware of the changes that are taking place in the industry in terms of technologies and features. ""We will also be there to meet whatever is the customer's need in terms of design, in terms of performance, in terms of comfort, convenience, features and technology,"" he said. When asked about MSI's upcoming products, he declined to share details but added that the company has a robust product plan. On safety aspects of MSI cars, with many of its models not faring well in the Global NCAP crash tests, Raman said during the product development stage a lot of internal tests are conducted on its cars. ""The vehicles are tested with various kinds of impacts, not just side but offset as well..the criteria of internal tests is very stringent. Obviously, we meet all the mandated safety norms of India,"" he added. He noted that industry body SIAM has written to the government to have Bharat NCAP, so that there is uniformity and standardised protocols for everyone in the industry.
