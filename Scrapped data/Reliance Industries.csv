Speaking at the annual general meeting of the company, Tata Power Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran said that the company continues with a more focused and pragmatic approach to achieve the set renewable energy targets and has added 707 MW of renewable capacity during FY22.  “This has increased our clean and green portfolio to 34% of total capacity and the company aims to raise it to 60% in the next five years,"" he said. He further said that Tata Power is looking to scale its Generation capacity to over 30 GW by FY27 from current 13.5 GW with an increased clean energy portfolio from and by 2030 the company is eyeing to increase the share of renewable energy and 80% by 2030.  The Chairman also said that the company holds a strong solar EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) order book of ₹13,000 crore and is also setting up a 4 GW solar cell and module manufacturing capacity in Tamil Nadu with an investment of ₹3,000 crore. For the year FY23, the company has planned a consolidated capex of ₹14,000 crore which includes an ₹10,000 crore for the renewable space. Chandrasekaran said that the company is equally focused on growing consumer centric and new-age energy solutions including solar rooftop, EV chargers, solar pumps, smart metering and energy management solutions, enabling power in the hands of the consumers.  “To scale up these green businesses and solutions, your company also entered a strategic partnership and created a renewables platform which has got an investment of ₹4,000 crore from Blackrock Real assets and Mubadala Investment company,"" he said, adding that the company is committed to deliver strong performance in the transmission and distribution business, serving 12 million customers including 9 million customers in Odisha.

In this pursuit, we have set ourselves on path for 3 key goals of becoming Carbon Net Zero by 2045, 100% water neutral by 2030 and zero waste to landfill before 2030,"" he said. The announcement of massive investment in the renewable space comes at a time when several other industry giants including Reliance Industries and Adani Group have also announced plans for huge investments into the space. Government’s target of achieving 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2070 has also given a push to the industry to move towards to cleaner fuel and renewable sources of energy."

An unprecedented windfall tax on fuel exports, which pushed the stock down by as much as 9% on Friday, seemed to do the trick."
Updated: 04 Jul 2022,RIL shares: What brokerages say after windfall tax announcement,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/reliance-industries-ril-shares-what-brokerages-say-after-govt-s-windfall-tax-announcement-11656902501279.html,"The government on Friday imposed an export tax on petrol, diesel and jet fuel while also joining nations like the UK in imposing a windfall tax on crude oil produced locally. Govt's unprecedented move to tax diesel and gasoline exports is designed to cap refining profits of pvt refiners like Reliance Industries (RIL) in global brokerage Jefferies' view.  ""The impact of the move is a 4% cut to RIL's FY23E Ebitda as we were working with US$ 13/bbl GRM est. While we see no reason to cut refining Ebitda for FY24E (used in our SOTP) based on developments, the govt intervention prompts us to cut refining valuation multiple to 7x from 8x,"" the note stated. The  brokerage has lowered its price target on RIL shares to ₹2,900 while maintaining Buy tag. The government slapped a ₹23,230 per tonne additional tax on domestically produced crude oil to take away windfall gains accruing to producers from high international oil prices, as domestic crude producers sell crude to domestic refineries at international parity prices. As a result, the domestic crude producers are making windfall gains.  Though, brokerage Emkay has upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold as it believes that export taxes to dent gross refining margins (GRMs) but annual earnings resilient. The inclusion of the SEZ refinery was surprising, though tax officials quoted by media said that the imposition was in line with statute. The fortnightly review indicated by senior Finance Ministry officials implies that any downsides to broader GRMs would be protected, as per the brokerage. “We do not expect any downside risk to RIL’s earnings unless a decline in GRM is not offset by an export duty rollback (fortnightly review should take care). The outlook for Retail and Jio businesses is also steady, while higher gas prices and commissioning of MJ-1 field would support upstream earnings,"" Emkay added. After the recent correction, the brokerage house finds RIL stock's valuations attractive, but has lowered its March 2023 target price slightly to ₹2,800. The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint."

Updated: 02 Jul 2022,Windfall tax by government to impact oil and gas companies: Analysts ,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/windfall-tax-by-government-to-impact-oil-gas-companies-analysts-11656740952840.html,"Shares of oil and gas companies saw a steep fall on Friday following the government's move to levy duty on exports of auto fuel and impose a windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil. Reliance Industries stock closed 7.19% lower on Friday, seeing an intraday decline of more than 8%. ONGC and Oil India shares ended over 13% and 15% lower respectively on the BSE. “Export taxes, restrictions and windfall taxes on oil producers are a global trend and highlight the tightening energy market outlook,"" said analysts at Morgan Stanley Research in their report. As per the analysts, India's announcement is incrementally negative for sector valuations.  ONGC is most negatively impacted, while Reliance Industries can manage the changes comparatively better, analysts said. The government has imposed a special excise duty of ₹6 per litre on exports of petrol and aviation turbine fuel (ATF) and ₹13 per litre on exports of diesel. This, as per analysts, is expected to impact refiners and exporters such as Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy (Vadinar refinery).  It is the gains that these refiners were likely making while exporting refined crude products, that may have prompted the government to impose the taxes. Reliance Industries was seeing regular upgrades aided by strong and improving outlook for its oil to chemical business mainly led by strong refining margins. The government's move to levy a cess of ₹23,250 per tonne on domestically produced crude oil may impact the earnings of state-owned oil producers such as ONGC Ltd, Oil India Ltd and private sector Vedanta Ltd. With crude prices above $100 a barrel, the producers too had been making extraordinary profits. “Gasoline and diesel are the key contributors to Reliance's refining slate contributing 72% of refining throughput,"" as per analysts at Jefferies India Private Ltd. They estimate $7 a barrel blended impact on RIL excluding any exemption. “With ~58% of RIL's refined products being exported, the blended impact for Reliance could be ₹3.4 per litre translating to $7 a barrel impact on realized Gross Refining Margins,"" said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd in their report. Nevertheless, excluding the SEZ refinery, (if exempted), the impact on RIL's GRM would be just $1 per barrel.  The impact on state-owned oil and gas producers ONGC and Oil India is likely to be much more. Vedanta Ltd may see some impact on earnings due to higher taxes, but it is a producer of multiple natural resources and oil and gas production through its subsidiary Cairn India contributed only about 10% to revenues and 13% to Ebitda during FY22. Not surprising, Vedanta share prices declined just 4.04% compared to the steeper fall seen in stock prices of ONGC and Oil India. Higher cess on domestic crude production of $40 per barrel for ONGC and OIL India was a negative surprise and should imply downside risks for the sector, said analysts at Morgan Stanley Research. It impacts ONGC and OIL India earnings for FY23 by 36% and 24%, they said. Higher margins that oil and gas companies were enjoying due to elevated crude prices and gross refining margins (GRMs) should normalize now, said analysts. As the sector tailwind is gone, stock prices are getting adjusted to the new reality, said Manish Jeloka, co-head of products & solutions, Sanctum Wealth. Once the impact of news is over, the medium-to-long-term returns will depend on company-specific fundamentals, added Joleka Analysts were surprised by the government’s sudden move. An analyst at the domestic broking said that government has not specified any duration for these taxes. Further, there are no slabs as to at what level of crude prices the taxes are available, since the prices may not remain elevated forever, added analysts. “No sunset date has been specified though we believe this is an extraordinary measure given the inflated profit environment in refining today,"" said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd. Revenue secretary Tarun Bajaj on Friday said the government will review the windfall tax on petroleum and the duty on auto fuel export every 15 days for recalibration."
Updated: 02 Jul 2022,Reliance share price tanks over 7%. Is this fall a good buying opportunity?,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/reliance-share-price-tanks-over-7-is-this-fall-a-good-buying-opportunity-11656735107007.html,"Reliance Industries share price tanked over 7 per cent on Friday session following Government of India (GoI) levying taxes on windfall gains made by domestic refineries. Reliance share price on Friday opened with a downside gap of near ₹20 per share and went on to make its intraday low of ₹2,365 apiece, giving fear to its shareholders of hitting lower circuit. However, the stock pared its early morning losses in the second half and ended at ₹2,406 per share levels on NSE. According to stock market experts, export oriented oil manufacturing companies are expected to make staggering income from cheaper crude oil being available by the Russian government. In that scenario, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), which is one of the biggest diesel exporters in India is also expected to incur windfall gains. So, the GoI move aims to ask for its share in the additional income Reliance and other oil making companies are expected to collect after Russia-Ukraine war. They said that Reliance Industries shares are expected to feel the pressure as market is expected to further discount on Reliance shares when the market opens next week. Speaking on the reason for dip in Reliance share price, Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities said, ""GoI levying taxes on windfall gains made by domestic oil refineries has not gone down well on the Dalal Street. Reliance shares nosediving on Friday has to be seen from this perspective. As Reliance is one of the major diesel and other oil exporter company in India, it is expected to continue receiving the beating. So, Reliance shares may continue to remain under pressure next week as well because the market may further discount on this GoI move."" On what technical chart suggests in regard to Reliance share price pattern, Rohit Singre, AVP- Technical Research at Bonanza Portfolio said, ""Reliance share price has strong support at ₹2360 apiece levels. If the stock continues to remain above this level on first half of the Monday session, then only we can expect some rebound in the counter. Otherwise, negative bias would continue in the stock.""  Rohit Singre of Bonanza Portfolio went on to add that on breaching of ₹2360 support, there can be further sharp downside movement. So, those who want to take fresh buying position in the counter, they are advised to wait for some time as they might get this quality stock at more discounter price in next few sessions. Meanwhile, Prabhudas Lilladher has upgraded its Reliance Industries share target from ₹3,000 per share to ₹3,277 per share in long term citing, ""RIL with access to discounted Russian crude (discount at over USD 30/bbl) and EU exports is best placed to capitalize on tight market conditions, given high refining complexity. We believe higher gas prices along with strong growth in telecom (continued tariff hikes) and retail (store expansion), make RIL a preferred play in challenging times. Reiterate ‘BUY’ with revised PT of ₹3,277 per share."" Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint."

The centre has also mandated exporters to meet the requirements of the domestic market first. The government has levied a ₹6 per litre tax on exports of petrol and ATF and ₹13 per litre on exports of diesel. The government has also announced taxes on windfall gains made by crude oil producers. The government also slapped a ₹23,230 per tonne additional tax on domestically produced crude oil to take away windfall gains accruing to producers from high international oil prices, a separate government notification showed. Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) witnessed a sharp fall after the export tax hike announcement. RIL shares plunged more than 5%, its biggest decline in about 18 months, whereas ONGC shares tanked 10% in Friday's early deals, while BSE Sensex was down nearly a per cent. “Reliance is witnessing a sharp fall after the Government has levied taxes on windfall gains made by domestic refineries. Earlier Reliance was firing on all cylinders but now there is a break in its refinery business as the commodity cycle is also reversing however other verticals have strong growth potential,"" said Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart Ltd. Fuels from Mukesh Ambani-led RIL's Jamnagar refinery are exported to several countries across the world.  Gasoline exporters have been asked to give a self declaration that 50% of the quantity mentioned in the shipping bill has been or will be supplied to the domestic market during the current financial year. The tax on exports follows oil refiners, particularly the private sector, reaping huge gains from exporting fuel to markets such as Europe and the US. The tax on domestically produced crude oil follows local producers reaping windfall gains from the surge in international oil prices.  Domestic petrol and diesel prices have been steady since May when the government announced a cut in excise duty on petrol by 8 per litre, and 6 rupees per litre on diesel on May 21, 2022. The domestic fuel prices are likely to remain low as the taxes announced today by the government do not impact them."
Updated: 01 Jul 2022,RIL brings Pret A Manger to India,https://www.livemint.com/companies/ril-brings-pret-a-manger-to-india-11656615130297.html,"NEW DELHI : After the fashion world, Reliance Brands Ltd (RBL) is eyeing the food and beverages space. The company has announced a strategic partnership with Pret A Manger, the UK-based fresh food and organic coffee chain that has more than 550 stores across the world, to launch and build the brand in India. Started in London in 1986, Pret A Manger, French for “ready to eat"", is known for its sandwiches, salads and wraps, besides coffee. As part of the master franchise partnership, Reliance Brands will open the food chain across the country, starting with major cities and travel hubs. In an interview, Pano Christou, the chief executive of Pret A Manger, said: “I think there’s a strong connection between the UK and India—the number of students that come to the UK, people travelling to the UK for pleasure. And I think that when you look at the younger population in India, they are going out more, eating out more, experimenting more. I think India is a very exciting market."" RBL, a unit of Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd, began operations in 2007 with a mandate to launch and build global brands in luxury to premium segments across fashion and lifestyle. In the past five years, RBL has invested in homegrown Indian designer labels, such as Manish Malhotra and Anamika Khanna, as well as partnering with international luxury and fashion brands. Its current portfolio of brand partnerships includes Armani Exchange, Bally, Bottega Veneta, Brooks Brothers, Burberry, Canali, Coach, Diesel, Dune, Emporio Armani, Ermenegildo Zegna, G-Star Raw, Gas, Giorgio Armani, Hamleys, Hugo Boss, Hunkemoller, Jimmy Choo, Kate Spade New York, Manish Malhotra, Michael Kors, Mothercare and Muji. “The secret sauce of RBL is understanding these 50 million consumers who have disposable income, travel the world and want to experience new things,"" said RBL’s managing director Darshan Mehta. “We follow the way these consumers spend their money, and what we have discovered is that there is an engagement and involvement in food as a category of consumption as much as in fashion. People are as much engaged in food experiences as in retail experiences. Frankly, I think food is the new fashion."" In a market crowded with Tata’s Starbucks stores and a growing number of homegrown coffee brands that also offer food, it would be interesting to see how Pret will fare. Both Christou and Mehta are confident. “We have a good brand and a proven track record, so I think we don’t have to worry about growth. The idea right now is to connect with the consumer and take it forward from there,"" says Mehta. To suit the Indian palate, the chain will make some changes to its global menu, details of which are still a work in progress. Regarding the specific number of stores and locations, Christou said: “We’d like to open our first store within the first fiscal year. And after that, we will evolve based on the response we get from the consumer."" Mehta added: “Indians, like their global counterparts, are seeking fresh and organic ingredient-led dining experiences. Couple that with the high recall the Pret brand enjoys in the country, it’s undoubtedly a recipe for success."""
Updated: 30 Jun 2022,Mukesh Ambani’s succession plan for Reliance gets clearer,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/mukesh-ambani-s-succession-plan-for-reliance-gets-clearer-11656606974741.html,"There was once a time that billionaire Mukesh Ambani and his younger brother, Anil, lived in the same Mumbai house with their mother even as they fought in Indian courts over their father’s empire. Dhirubhai Ambani had died in 2002 without a will—and thus the fraternal feud. As part of a 2005 family settlement, Mukesh had won control of deep-sea fields in the Bay of Bengal that had just started producing gas. But the agreement also required him to supply cheap feedstock at a fixed price for 17 years to Anil’s proposed power plant. Honouring that pact might have ended power outages in New Delhi, but it would have crippled Mukesh’s Reliance Industries. Luckily for the older sibling, a Supreme Court verdict in May 2010 went in his favour: The gas was held to be Indian sovereign property, not Mukesh’s to give. Two weeks later, the brothers agreed to live in “harmony"" and end most of the non-compete clauses of their separation, including in telecom, where Anil ran a service. Mukesh entered the market, a move that would catapult him to his current standing as the world’s 10th richest tycoon with a net worth of $90 billion. Since then, the gas discovery has proved to be a damp squib and many of Anil’s firms have gone bankrupt. It was symbolic, therefore, that when Mukesh Ambani put his own succession plan in motion this week, he started with Jio, his telecom service. His son Akash, 30, will succeed him as chairman at India’s top wireless carrier, though the patriarch will continue to helm Jio Platforms, which owns all digital assets. This may be a stopgap until Jio Platforms, whose investors include Meta and Alphabet Inc, concludes its much-awaited initial public offering. Akash’s twin sister Isha is widely expected to head Reliance’s retail business. Anant, 27, the youngest of the three children, may preside over the legacy oil-to-chemicals business. But with a twist: He must complete his dad’s pivot away from hydrocarbons towards cleaner energy. Mukesh Ambani only began talking about the “momentous leadership transition"" last December, at an employees’ event. It’s hard to say what the eventual arrangement will look like. But it wouldn’t be a surprise if retail, telecom and energy end up as professionally managed and independently listed companies, with equity participation—and operational support—from one or more strategic partners. In this scenario, the children, plus Ambani and his wife Nita, can exercise control through their shares in Reliance Industries, which will own stakes in Jio Platforms, Reliance Retail and the energy business, Reliance O2C. Such a structure won’t be without problems. Separate stock-market listings for the units could saddle Reliance with a permanent holding-company discount: the tendency of the stock market to value a conglomerate at less than the sum of its parts. But de-merging them—so that Reliance investors would directly own proportional stakes of entities—may erode the might of the consolidated balance sheet. Fitch Ratings assesses Reliance’s foreign-currency creditworthiness at BBB, a notch higher than India’s sovereign debt. Reliance has a major cost-of-capital advantage as it has high operating profits and very little debt, an edge that may be of great value to the next generation. If this is indeed the favoured template, then the model is in place for Jio Platforms minus an IPO: Google didn’t just invest in Jio, it also helped it with a cheap, Android-based phone; Facebook’s WhatsApp service could help local JioMart stores take customer orders and payments over phones. Ambani might have wanted to strike similar deals with Amazon in retail and with Saudi Aramco for his oil business. But instead of a partnership with Amazon, there’s now keen competition and Reliance’s courtship of Aramco collapsed. Worse, Bloomberg News reported that arch-rival Adani was flirting with Aramco. With so much going on, Mukesh Ambani will want as little boardroom drama as possible. When Mukesh and Anil Ambani were taking their gas dispute to court in 2009, the combined stock-market value of their empires was $108 billion—five times what they were worth before the family settlement. Now, Mukesh’s Reliance Industries is worth $221 billion, while pretty much the only value left in Anil’s group, outside of power generation, transmission and distribution, is whatever creditors can get from bankruptcy proceedings against several of his firms. For now, Ambani’s children will want to keep their ties to the Reliance mothership; which means they will have to accept the conglomerate’s capital-allocation policies even as they are free to do their own thing. That’s likely the best their father can do for them—and the group—without weakening the whole. It’s a better transition than what he had to endure.

This is probably a stopgap arrangement until Jio Platforms, whose investors include Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc., concludes its much-awaited initial public offering. Since telecom carriage is entwined with commerce — Ambani’s Reliance Retail runs India’s largest network of stores while his JioMart is a federation of mom-and-pop shops looking to sell online — Akash’s twin sister Isha is widely expected to head it. In such a scenario, the 27-year-old Anant — the youngest of the three children — will likely preside over the legacy oil-to-chemicals business. But with a twist: He has to complete his dad’s pivot away from polluting hydrocarbons and toward cleaner energy sources like solar panels, sodium-ion batteries and, most importantly, green hydrogen at under $1 per 1 kilogram within a decade, or what his dad calls the 1-1-1 target.

Reliance enjoys a formidable cost of capital advantage because it has a high operating profit and very little debt. Keeping that edge may be of great value to the next generation, especially as the rivalry intensifies with India’s other industrial titan, Gautam Adani — who has leapfrogged Ambani on the global wealth rankings to take the No. 7 spot.    If this is indeed the favored template, then the model is in place for Jio Platforms minus the IPO: Google’s Sundar Pichai didn’t just invest in Jio, he also helped it with a cheap, Android-based phone; Facebook’s WhatsApp messaging service could help neighborhood JioMart stores  take customer orders and payments on the phone. Ambani might have wanted to strike similar deals with Amazon.com Inc. in retail and with Saudi Aramco for his oil-refining complex, the world’s largest. But instead of a partnership with Amazon, there’s now keen competition. Reliance’s courtship of Aramco went on for more than two years, only to collapse without a transaction. Worse, Bloomberg News has reported that arch-rival Adani is now flirting with Aramco. With so much going on, Ambani will want as little boardroom drama as possible.  When Mukesh and Anil Ambani were taking their dispute over gas to the Indian Supreme Court in the summer of 2009, the combined stock-market value of their empires was $108 billion — five times what they were worth before the family settlement. Now, Mukesh’s Reliance Industries is worth $221 billion, while pretty much the only value left in Anil’s group, outside of power generation, transmission and distribution, is whatever creditors can get from bankruptcy proceedings against several of his firms.  Could the brothers have achieved more together, for themselves and investors? Perhaps not. Much is made of their different personalities: Mukesh has always been reticent, publicity-shy and execution-focused; Anil, when I last saw him during the feud with his brother, was gregarious, flamboyant, and much loved by politicians and the media. Such differences between siblings, however, can be complementary. But when they aren’t, it’s best for each to go their separate way. For now, Ambani’s children will want to keep their ties to the Reliance mothership; which means they will have to accept the conglomerate’s capital-allocation policies even as they are free to do their own thing. That’s likely the best their father can do for them — and the group — without weakening the whole. It’s certainly a better transition than what he had to endure.

Updated: 30 Jun 2022,Mukesh Ambani's children at centre of leadership change at Reliance Industries,https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/mukesh-ambani-s-children-akash-ambani-isha-ambani-and-anant-ambani-at-centre-of-leadership-change-at-reliance-industries-11656545906758.html,"Reliance Industries leadership team: Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, one of the country's richest individuals, has initiated a long-anticipated leadership transition at the energy-to-retail conglomerate Reliance by handing over the chairmanship of its telecoms unit to his son. The move is the first sign of change at Ambani's empire after the billionaire last year said his children would have significant roles in the business, adding Reliance was ""in the process of effecting a momentous leadership transition."" Here are details about Mukesh Ambani's three children who are expected to have greater say in India's biggest conglomerate valued at around $200 billion. AKASH AMBANI Akash, Ambani's elder son, joined the leadership team at the group's telecom unit, Reliance Jio, in 2014, soon after completing his graduation in economics from Brown University. As a non-executive director, he worked closely on the company's strategy and growth plans that made Jio India's biggest telecom operator with more than 400 million subscribers. He will now be the chairman of the telecom unit, Reliance said Tuesday. Akash has been closely involved in product development and employee engagement to bring a ""young and vibrant culture"", the company says. An avid cricketer, he also plays a key role in the management of Mumbai Indians, a Reliance-owned team in IPL, the world's richest cricket league. Akash was also part of a team that brokered a $5.7 billion investment in 2020 by Meta Platforms in a Reliance unit, Jio Platforms. In 2019, he married Shloka Mehta, the daughter of a wealthy diamond merchant. ISHA AMBANI Isha is Akash's twin sister and already tasked with driving the company's retail, e-commerce and luxury plans. Reliance is also India's biggest bricks-and-mortar retailer, with plans to expand swiftly into e-commerce to take on giants like Amazon. She is also involved in expanding Reliance's presence in fashion through the company's Ajio e-commerce app as well as Reliance's partnerships with top international brands. Isha has a business management degree from Stanford. Fortune magazine last year referred to her as ""Heiress on Duty"" while ranking her the 21st most powerful woman in India. She is working closely in conceptualising a new Reliance mall, including how the company pitches the highly sensitive placement of rival luxury brands next to each other, Reuters has reported. In 2018, Isha married Anand Piramal, the son of a billionaire industrialist with interests in real estate and pharma. ANANT AMBANI Anant is Ambani's youngest son who is focussing on the conglomerate's new energy business, a key area of investment for Ambanis. Reliance is vying to be at the forefront of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambition to ramp up green energy capacity. Reliance has major expansion plans to diversify into clean energy projects, including solar and green hydrogen. Anant has in the past addressed audiences, along with Akash and Isha, at company events. Anant graduated from Brown University in 2017.

Updated: 30 Jun 2022,Reliance key beneficiary as refining margins skyrocket,https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/reliance-key-beneficiary-as-refining-margins-skyrocket-11656521938342.html,"NEW DELHI : Asian refining margins have shot up as crude oil trades at elevated levels, resulting in windfall gains for oil refiners. While Indian refiners across the board have gained, a key beneficiary is top energy firm Reliance Industries Ltd, winning multiple earnings upgrades, and its stock racing ahead of benchmark indices. According to Moody’s Investor Services, the Singapore-Dubai hydrocracking margin averaged at a multi-year high of $39 per barrel in the week ending 24 June, close to 20 times the $2 average in 2021. Refining margins are at super-cycle levels because of a shortage of transportation fuels as demand outpaces supply in Asia, Moody’s said. The rebound in demand for auto fuels following the easing of covid-led restrictions has boosted gross refining margins (GRMs). Supplies squeezed by the sanctions against Russia, following significant refinery closures during the pandemic, lifted them further. The mismatch in demand and supply has driven a surge in the margins of gasoline, gasoil and jet fuels, added Moody’s. Total operable refining capacity in the US declined by 509,000 bopd (barrels of oil per day) in 2021, following a decline of 422,000 bopd in 2020, Haitong Securities said. Lower margins during the pandemic and higher costs led to a sharp fall in capacity, erasing capacity additions of the last five years, said analysts. Also due to a production quota, Chinese refining throughput remains under pressure. The surge in GRMs has improved the prospects of Indian refiners. Oil refining major Reliance Industries Ltd has received upgrades by multiple foreign brokerages, with its stock outperforming the broader indices. Other beneficiaries of higher margins include oil marketing companies (OMCs) Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL), and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL). Though OMCs continue to see headwinds led by high crude prices and pressure on marketing margins, however, they are still getting some cushion to their earnings from firm refining margins. “Multi-year-low inventories, declining Russian exports, muted Chinese exports, lower diesel production in Europe and delays in commissioning of ME refineries are, in our view, tailwinds to refining margins in CY22,"" Jefferies India Ltd said in a report. Initial estimates suggest RIL could deliver 60% sequential growth in O2C (oil to chemical) Ebitda in 1QFY23 with the likelihood of earnings upgrades, added Jefferies. Other brokerages too say RIL is set to benefit immensely from strong refining margins and gas prices. “Our EBITDA/EPS estimates are 8%/4% above the consensus estimates for FY23/FY24 and can potentially see a further upward revision based on global refining margins in H2FY23"" said analysts at Haitong Securities. They expect the European Union’s complete phase-out of Russian petroleum products over the next 6-8 months, US refinery shutdowns and higher usage of fossil fuels to counter cost inflation to continue supporting the GRMs. Though analysts expect a fall in product cracks over the period from current levels, they expect it to remain significantly higher than the last five-year average. JP Morgan Asia Pacific Equity Research too has upgraded the ratings of Reliance Industries Ltd. In their view, RIL is among the few large companies in India with a positive earnings revision cycle ahead, given the strong refining and gas environment. “Our upgrade to Over Weight is driven by a global view of strong refining environment though we build in a decline in product cracks from current levels; and, RIL’s non-energy business valuations continuing to hold up,"" said analysts at JP Morgan. Meanwhile, the financial performance of India’s state-owned refining and marketing companies—BPCL, HPCL and IOCL—though getting support from firm refining margins, is expected to remain weak so long as their net realized prices for gasoline and gasoil are lower than international market prices, said analysts. Nonetheless, Moody’s investor services added that it does not expect this situation to be sustained. They expect the Indian government to eventually allow fuel retailers to adjust selling prices, but the price increases will be implemented gradually."

Not yet, anyway. India’s – and Asia’s – richest businessman may have handed over the reins of his empire’s telecom and data business, Reliance Jio Infocomm, to his eldest son Akash, but this by no means signals his exit from the active management of his companies. He not only continues to be the chairman and managing director of the mother ship, Reliance Industries Ltd., whose cash flows essentially underwrite the other diversifications but also is the chairman and MD of Jio Platforms, the holding company that controls all the group’s digital businesses and is majority-owned by Reliance Industries. But by not only handing over the reins of Reliance Jio Infocomm to his eldest son Akash, who has taken over as its chairman and managing director, and stepping down from the board of the company, he has set a clear succession plan in motion. Media reports suggest that Akash’s twin sister, Isha Ambani, currently a director on the board of the Reliance conglomerate’s retail arm, Reliance Retail Ventures, will also shortly be elevated to the top job in the retail business. And the youngest son Anant, who is on the boards of both Jio Platforms, the holding company that controls the digital business, as well as Reliance Retail Ventures, will reportedly be given the ‘O2C’ (oil to petrochemicals) business of the mother ship, Reliance Industries, as well as its new energy initiatives.

On Tuesday, the 65-year-old tycoon made way for his first-born Akash Ambani to become the chairman of India’s No. 1 wireless carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. Akash’s twin sister Isha, 30, is set to be appointed chair of Reliance’s retail arm, and an announcement is expected as early as Wednesday, people familiar with the matter said. The company declined to comment. While Mumbai-based Reliance has telegraphed such a leadership transition, the move underscores the senior Ambani’s efforts to avert family feuds that have torn many wealthy clans apart, including his own. Bloomberg News reported last year that the mogul’s favored succession plan shares elements with that of Walmart Inc.’s Walton family, a framework that would allow the biggest transfer of wealth in recent times. The changes at the top come at a crucial time for Reliance. In a pivot from its legacy oil refining and petrochemicals business, the conglomerate is diversifying into e-commerce, green energy and expanding its retail footprint across the country. In 2020, technology venture Jio Platforms Ltd. lured more than $25 billion from marquee Silicon Valley investors including Meta Platforms Inc. and Google. It has also unveiled ambitious plans to take on Amazon.com Inc. in the country, including streaming. “It shows a well-planned succession plan,"" said Sankaran Manikutty, a former professor who taught at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad and has extensively worked on family businesses, telecommunications and strategy in emerging economies. “Ambani just ensured the continuity of the business. For now, nothing will change for the conglomerate, but Mukesh Ambani will be around to guide the next generation."" Before their elevation, both Isha and Akash played prominent roles as directors in those units. They were part of teams that negotiated with Meta when the Menlo Park, California-based company decided to invest almost $6 billion in Jio Platforms. At annual shareholders meetings in recent years, the twins have introduced new products and demonstrated various technology applications such as virtual reality. Their father has credited his children with helping nudge him into the internet business. Isha, a Yale University graduate and a former McKinsey & Co. consultant, kicked off Reliance’s e-commerce foray into fashion retail in 2016 by starting online shopping portal Ajio. Like Jio Platforms, Reliance Retail Ventures also brought on board many investors like General Atlantic and KKR & Co. in 2020, valuing the retailer at as much as $62 billion then.  Reliance Retail runs supermarkets, India’s largest consumer electronics chain store, a cash and carry wholesaler, fast-fashion outlets and an online grocery store called JioMart. It reported $2.6 billion in revenue for the year through March 2022. The unit operates more than 12,000 stores across the country.  Brown University Alumnus Akash, who has studied economics and is an alumnus of Brown University, will oversee a telecommunications operator that debuted in 2016. With its free calls and cheap data, Reliance Jio shook up an industry mired in debt and sent some competitors into bankruptcy. The group is betting on this unit’s pipes to deliver a range of services from e-commerce to entertainment in a market with almost 600 million smartphones. Reliance Jio is now gearing up for India’s auction of 5G airwaves by the end of July. The twins have a younger brother, Anant, 27, who is a member of the board of Jio Platforms. It’s still unclear what broader plans his father has for his youngest child.  Mukesh Ambani, the chairman and managing director of the group’s flagship Reliance Industries, has for years studied the ways in which billionaire families, from the Waltons to the Kochs, passed on what they’d built to the next generation, Bloomberg News reported last year. With the latest moves, Mukesh Ambani may still be looking at the Walton family model. Trust-Like Structure In a nod to that structure, Ambani was considering moving his family’s holdings into a trust-like structure that would control the Mumbai-listed flagship Reliance Industries, people familiar with the matter said last year. As part of that plan, Ambani, his wife Nita, and three children would have stakes in the new entity overseeing Reliance and be on its board, along with a few of Ambani’s long-term confidantes as advisers. Management, though, will largely be entrusted to outsiders, professionals who will handle the day-to-day operations of India’s most influential company and its businesses that span oil refining and petrochemicals to telecommunications, e-commerce and green energy.  By bringing his children into formal roles, Ambani is also seeking to avoid repeating the mistake of his own father, Dhirubhai, who died in 2002 without leaving a will. Mukesh and his younger brother Anil feuded for three years over the control of Reliance, before their mother stepped in to resolve the dispute by carving up the empire. The older sibling inherited the oil refining and petrochemicals businesses, while the younger one got the newer ventures in finance, infrastructure, power and telecom. Mukesh is Asia’s second-richest man with a net worth of about $91 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

In its order, SIAC said it would continue with the arbitration proceedings that began in October 2020 after Future Group proposed to sell its retail, wholesale and logistics assets to Reliance Industries Ltd for ₹24,713 crore ($3.2 billion). In April, Reliance called off the deal after Future Retail Ltd’s creditors rejected the proposal. Mint has reviewed a copy of the SIAC order. “The tribunal finds that the continuation of these proceedings has not been rendered unnecessary or impossible under Section 32(2)(c) of the Arbitration Act. Accordingly, there is no ground for the termination of these proceedings under the Arbitration Act,"" presiding arbitrator Michael Hwang S.C.’s order said. Future Retail argued that there was no basis for the tribunal to continue with the arbitration since the approval for the agreement based on which Amazon approached SIAC has been kept in abeyance by the Competition Commission of India (CCI). The 2019 agreement between Amazon and Future Coupons Pvt. Ltd, a promoter entity of Future Retail, has been kept under suspension by CCI for alleged suppression of facts.

An Indian monetary policy dove signaled it’s probably time to abandon the aggressive pace of increases in borrowing costs, saying the inflation-adjusted real interest-rate is approaching neutral terrain -- a level where it can help check inflation without stifling economic growth. Sticking to larger hikes instead carries the risk of crimping an already weak demand without materially softening inflation, Ashima Goyal, one of the six members of the Monetary Policy Committee, warned in an email interview, adding that she isn’t speaking on behalf of the full MPC. “Indian real interest rates are not far from neutral,"" she said, referring to benchmark rate that’s risen to 4.9%, amid inflation easing to 7% in May from 7.8% in the previous month   Asian shares were mostly higher Tuesday after a wobbly day on Wall Street as markets cooled off following a rare winning week. Oil prices pushed higher and U.S. futures also advanced.

Investors will get an update on U.S. economic growth on Wednesday when the Commerce Department releases a report on first-quarter gross domestic product.

Spot gold was last up 0.1% at $1,824.65 per ounce by 0056 GMT. U.S. gold futures were flat at $1,824.70. A move by Britain, the United States, Japan and Canada to ban new imports of Russian gold is being seen as largely symbolic within the global bullion market, as Russian exports to the West have already dried up.   Oil rose for a third session as threats to global output risked tightening the market further before OPEC+ meets this week to discuss supply. West Texas Intermediate futures climbed above $110 a barrel after adding about 5% over the past two sessions. Libya is facing more disruptions to its exports due to a worsening political crisis, while anti-government protests in Ecuador threaten to shut down production in the former OPEC member. Any halt to supply could reverberate through the global oil market, which has been squeezed by an economic rebound and upended trade flows from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. Some OPEC+ members have struggled to meet their production targets this year, exacerbating the tightness.   Asian shares edge down in early trade on Tuesday with investors taking their cue from a volatile Wall Street session overnight, while oil prices climbed following last week's rout. Oil continued to rise with investors still weighing worries over an economic slowdown against concern over lost Russian supply amid sanctions related to the conflict in Ukraine. ""A seam of tight supply news bolstered the (oil) market,"" analysts at Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a research note. ""Political unrest might curtail supply from a couple of second-tier producers, Ecuador and Libya. And then there's the G7's proposed price cap on Russian oil.""

U.S. stock futures, the S&P 500 e-minis, were up 0.27%. Australian shares were up 0.25%, while Japan's Nikkei stock index rose 0.5%. China's blue-chip CSI300 index was 0.4% lower in early trade. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index opened down 0.36%.   Australian shares climbed on Tuesday, lifted by miners and energy stocks, as easing of COVID-19 restrictions in China boosted prices of commodities. The S&P/ASX 200 index rose as much as 0.4% by 0043 GMT, its highest level since June 14. The benchmark jumped 1.9% on Tuesday. Leading gains on the benchmark, energy stocks climbed 2.5% to hit a near one-week high.   Tokyo stocks traded higher Tuesday on bargain-hunting, having opened down following falls on Wall Street. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was up 0.37 percent, or 100.42 points, at 26.971.69 in morning trade, while the broader Topix index was up 0.60 percent, or 11.33 points, at 1,898.75 yen.   US stocks ended a volatile trading session slightly lower on Monday after posting sharp gains the week before, while oil prices and Treasury yields rose. Oil climbed following last week's rout, as the Group of Seven nations promised to tighten the squeeze on Russia's finances with new sanctions that include a plan to cap the price of Russian oil. Investors have been hoping oil's slide from three-month peaks hit earlier in June could ease overall inflation concerns and allow the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten policy less aggressively than initially feared. Stocks moved between gains and losses during the session on Wall Street, with big growth shares leading the way down. The S&P 500 earlier this month confirmed it is in a bear market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 62.42 points, or 0.2%, to 31,438.26, the S&P 500 lost 11.63 points, or 0.30%, to 3,900.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 83.07 points, or 0.72%, to 11,524.55. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.52% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.31%. A further easing of COVID-19 restrictions in China helped to support global indexes. The 10-year note rose 7 basis points to 3.194% and the two-year's yield, which can herald rate expectations, gained 6.9 basis points to 3.126%. Brent crude futures settled up $1.97, or 1.7%, at $115.09 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude closed up $1.95, or 1.8%, at $109.57.  "

On 9 June, Mint reported that a consortium of RIL and buyout firm Apollo Global Management Inc. emerged as a top contender to acquire Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.’s Boots pharmacies unit in the UK, with an offer valuing the latter’s assets at $7-8 billion. “The board of Walgreens Boots Alliance is likely to meet in the next few days with an agenda to discuss the potential deal with the RIL-Apollo Global consortium.

Updated: 26 Jun 2022,"Bear days are numbered, build quality portfolio. These stocks are hot picks",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/bear-days-are-numbered-build-quality-portfolio-in-markets-these-stocks-are-hot-picks-11656263787991.html,"Markets recovered last week as equity benchmarks snapped a two-week losing streak as investors took a breather from inflation concerns due to the downside in commodity prices. Going forward, markets will continue to witness volatility as bearish stick still lingers with current macroeconomic risks, however, the days are numbered. The selling pressure is expected to be short-lived and experts have advised investors to build quality stocks portfolio. On Friday, Sensex finished at 52,727.98 up by 462.26 points or 0.88%. Nifty 50 closed at 15,699.25 higher by 142.60 points or 0.92%. Both the benchmarks have gained nearly 3% each from June 20 to 24. During these days, investors' wealth on BSE climbed by ₹7,40,977.89 crore. BSE market cap stood at ₹234,86,923.67 crore on June 20 and jumped to ₹242,27,901.56 crore on June 24. Research Analysts - Dharmesh Shah, Nitin Kunte, CMT, Pabitro Mukherjee, and Vinayak Parmar at ICICI Securities in their technical note said, equity benchmarks behaved contrary to our expectations as downbeat global cues tracking anxiety around rising inflation globally, rate hikes weighed on investor sentiments. On Nifty 50, they said the velocity of the decline accelerated on breach of March low of 15700 and drifted further to the 15200 mark. Going forward, the analysts said, ""We expect the index to gradually resolve higher and extend pullback towards the 16600 regions in coming months wherein strong support is placed in the vicinity of 14800-14600 zone, which we expect to hold as it is 80% retracement of CY-21 rally (13596-18604), at 14600. Thus, dips should be utilised to construct a portfolio by accumulating quality stocks in a staggered manner."" ICICI Securities analysts' positive bias is based on four factors: 1. The reading of the percentage of stocks above 200 DMA below 15 signifies extreme pessimism in the markets that eventually leads to a technical pullback to the tune of a minimum of 10% in the subsequent three months. 2. Index has already corrected 18% from the life highs and has approached oversold reading on the weekly momentum oscillator. The weekly RSI has approached its lowest level (placed at 35) since May 2020. Historically, a reading of 35 on weekly RSI has produced a decent pullback, and the analysts expect this rhythm to maintain in the coming months. 3. India continues to relatively outperform the EM basket even in the ongoing corrective phase despite significant selling by FIIs. Over the past one year, while the MSCI EM index has corrected over 40% from highs, India has relatively outperformed as the benchmark corrected only 18%. 4. The India VIX and crude oil prices have cooled off from the recent swing high. Indian Equities have an inverse correlation with the India VIX. Thus, providing impetus for the acceleration of ongoing pullback. They added, ""On the broader market front, in three instances over the past decade, intermediate correction in the Nifty Midcap, Small cap indices have been to the tune of 28% and 40%, respectively. At present, both indices have corrected 25% and 34%, respectively."" Therefore, the analysts said, ""any further correction is likely to be short-lived amid oversold territory and would set the stage for a technical pullback in coming weeks."" Here are the top picks of ICICI Securities analysts: BFSI - SBI, HDFC, Kotak Bank, Federal Bank, and Bajaj Finance. Telecom & Technology - Reliance, TCS, Infosys, L&T Infotech, HCL Technology, and Coforge. Capital goods - L&T, ABB, Siemens, BEL, AIA Engineering, ELGI Equipment, Sanghvi Movers, and Timken India. Consumption - Hindustan Unilever, Titan, ITC, Asian Paints, Tata Consumer, Havells India, Jubilant Foods, and Astral Poly. Auto - M&M, Maruti Suzuki, Ashok Leyland, Jamna Auto, Mahindra CIE, FIEM Industries, and Minda Industries. Infra and Realty - DLF LTD, Brigade Enterprise, and Phoenix Mills.

Others - Adani Port, Indian Hotels, Zee Entertainment, Trent, Concor, Nocil, Balrampur Chinni, BDL, Bluedart, Dixon Technologies, Kansai Nerolac, and NRB Bearing. Markets weekly outlook: For the week June 27 to July 1, ICICI Direct analysts expect Nifty to eventually resolve past falling channel placed at 15800 and gradually head towards 16200 levels in coming weeks. In expiry week, use dips towards 15400 to create long positions as the index is poised at extreme oversold readings. ICICI Direct analysts added that brent oil prices have breached the weekly rising trend line indicating a loss of momentum and ""we expect upsides to be capped in 125-130 zone."" According to ICICI Direct analysts, amongst sectors preferences, IT, and BFSI are key sectors with favourable risk/reward, while Auto and Capital goods are expected to extend outperformance. The analysts prefer - SBI, HDFC, Kotak Bank, TCS, Maruti Suzuki, ITC, and Titan in large caps while in midcaps we like KPIT Technologies, Federal Bank, AIA Engineering, NRB Bearings, Ashok Leyland, Automotive Axles, Bharat Electronics, Havells, Trent, and Indian Hotel. Yesha Shah, Head of Equity Research, Samco Securities said, ""The coming week has a host of events arriving which could affect the mood of the market. Globally, investors will keenly analyze the US quarterly GDP growth rate numbers. The USA would officially enter into a recession if they post a negative growth and thus this could have a spill-over effect on global markets."" ""In India, the vehicle sales figures will continue to fuel stock-specific moves on D-Street as investors attempt to decipher the future trend,"" Shah added, ""Moreover, the monthly F&O expiry in the second half of the week may cause volatility in the indices. Investors are thus advised to accumulate good stocks with strong fundamentals, free cash flows, and lower leverage over the long run while disregarding short-term difficulties."""
Updated: 23 Jun 2022,India's oil imports from Russia jumps 50 times; accounts for 10% of all import,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/indias-oil-imports-from-russia-jumps-50-times-accounts-for-10-of-all-import-11655998970715.html,"Russia has now emerged among the top 10 suppliers of crude oil to India. From all the crude oil purchases from overseas, India's imports from Russia have climbed more than 50 times since April. With that, Russian oil imports now account for 10% of India's total crude imports basket. Prior to the Ukraine war, Russian imports were just 0.2% of all the oil imported by India. An official told reporters, that Russian oil now makes up 10 percent of India's oil import basket in April. It is now among the top 10 suppliers, as reported by PTI. Notably, about 40% of Russian oil has been bought by private refiners namely Reliance Industries and Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy. In May, Indian refiners purchased approximately 25 million barrels of crude oil from Russia. Also, last month, Russia surpassed Saudi Arabia in becoming India's second-biggest oil supplier behind Iraq as refiners crowded Russian crude oil that is available at a deep discount in a multi-year high Brent crude and US WTI scenario following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. Saudi Arabia is now the third-largest crude oil supplier for India. India is the third-largest oil consumer in the world with 85% of which is imported, after China and the US. Due to the conflict with Ukraine, there have been fewer buyers for Russian Ural crude oil as some foreign governments and companies have exited the country's energy exports which led to a decline in the price. As per the report, Indian refiners have taken advantage of this and purchased Russian crude oil at discount as high as $30 per barrel. India has continuously defended its decision for crude oil purchases from Russia even when major western economies issued several sanctions on President Vladimir Putin-led country condemning their invasion of Ukraine. On May 4, in a press statement, the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas said India's India’s energy needs are enormous with daily consumption of around 5 million barrels and a refining capacity of 250 MMTPA. For energy security and to fulfill its objective of providing energy justice to each of its citizens, Indian Energy companies buy from all major oil producers in the World. On average, India has the unique distinction of servicing 60 million visitors at its petrol pumps every single day. Despite challenging times, it is important for the Government to ensure access to affordable energy for our citizens. According to the ministry, India's top 10 import destinations are mostly from West Asia. In the recent past, the USA has become a major crude oil source for India, supplying almost $13 bn worth of energy imports, with almost 7.3% of the market share of crude oil imports. The ministry had explained that Indian Energy companies have been sourcing energy supplies from Russia, on a sustained basis, over the past several years. Yearly figures may have varied due to a variety of reasons, including operational necessities. If suddenly, now, as a huge importer of crude oil, India pulls back on its diversified sources, concentrating on the remaining, in an already constrained market, it will lead to further volatility and instability, jacking up international prices. ""Despite attempts to portray it otherwise, energy purchases from Russia remain minuscule in comparison to India’s total consumption,"" the ministry had said."
Updated: 23 Jun 2022,RIL share price correction a buying opportunity: Jefferies,https://www.livemint.com/news/reliance-industries-ril-share-price-correction-a-buying-opportunity-jefferies-11655957162266.html,"Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) have corrected about 12% from its recent high. Multi year-low inventories, declining Russian exports, muted Chinese exports, lower diesel production in Europe and delays in commissioning of ME refineries are, in global brokerage Jefferies' view, tailwinds to refining margins in CY22.  The brokerage house has maintained its Buy rating on RIL shares with a target price of ₹2,950 as it believes the recent stock price correction offers opportunity. ""RIL is a key beneficiary of energy inflation, with every $1/bbl improvement in annualized refining margins adding an estimated $ 400-450 mm to RIL's Consol EBITDA (2% uplift). Initial estimates suggest RIL could deliver 60% sequential growth in O2C Ebitda in 1QFY23E with likelihood of earnings upgrade,"" the note stated. Jefferies believes RIL has sustainable competitive advantage on scale economics, cost leadership, financial strength, recurring positive FCF FY22E onwards. Its new growth engines with large addressable markets: Digital in Jio, e-commerce in RR, COTC in energy Interesting optionalities with likely financial services foray and partnerships. India's top valued company RIL reported over 22% surge in its fourth-quarter profit at ₹16,203 crore on the back of bumper oil refining margins, steady growth in telecom, digital services and retail business. The Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate's revenue from operations rose 37% to ₹2.11 lakh crore during the quarter ended March 31, 2022. It became the first Indian company to have crossed $100 billion revenue in a year. Last week, another global brokerage JP Morgan upgraded RIL shares' rating to overweight from Neutral, driven by global view of strong refining environment as it believes Reliance Industries is among the few large companies in India with a positive earnings revision cycle ahead, given the strong refining and gas environment. Mukesh Ambani chairs and runs Reliance Industries, which has interests in petrochemicals, oil and gas, telecom and retail. Almost 60% of Reliance’s revenue comes from oil-refining and petrochemicals, though, the conglomerate has been reducing its dependence on oil-refining by diversifying into retail, telecommunications and technology. The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint."
Updated: 17 Jun 2022,Ambani opted in favour of IPL's digital streaming with eyes on ad revenues,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ambani-opted-in-favour-of-ipl-s-digital-streaming-with-eyes-on-ad-revenues-in-future-11655470416234.html,"Mukesh Ambani’s group ultimately dropped the pursuit of television broadcast rights to India’s top cricket league that Walt Disney Co. secured for $3 billion as the Indian conglomerate saw limited opportunity for long-term profit from the legacy platform. The joint venture between Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. and US media giant Paramount Global instead focused on winning the rights to digitally stream the lucrative Indian Premier League, betting its advertising revenue will be four-fold bigger than that for TV in five years, a person familiar with the group’s strategy said. The view was that television would struggle to deliver double digit growth, according to the person, who didn’t want to be identified discussing deliberations that were private. While Viacom18 Media Pvt., the Ambani-Paramount JV, bid for TV rights in the initial rounds of the auction, this person said the focus was always on ensuring it secured digital rights. A representative for Reliance Industries declined to comment on the auction strategy. Viacom18 paid 238 billion rupees ($3.1 billion) for the rights to stream the IPL tournament, one of the world’s most-watched sporting events, almost on par with what Disney shelled out. The decision gels with Ambani’s ambitions for his digital unit Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. The billionaire, currently India’s richest man, wants to create a consumer ecosystem that marries entertainment and e-commerce to lure local users who are increasingly hooked to their smartphones. The decision to let go of television rights saved Reliance billions of dollars, funds that can potentially be used to boost the conglomerate’s chances in the upcoming India auction for 5G spectrum. A prized cricket broadcast, which can add millions of subscribers, streamed on a speedy wireless network can be a potent mix for turbocharging Jio. “The Jio DNA in Reliance gives them the foresight and the conviction to stay with very long-tail customer acquisition strategies,"" said Utkarsh Sinha, managing director in Mumbai-based Bexley Advisors. Jio debuted in 2016 and blew out competition to emerge the top telecom player. “They go for complete scale domination, and IPL has historically proven to be one of the most reliable properties"" for adding sticky consumers on an OTT platform, Sinha said. Pivot to Streaming Jay Shah, the head of Board of Cricket Control in India, said in a separate interview that the country may see 900 million internet users in five years, underscoring the potential of digital rights. While TV was the staple source of entertainment in Indian middle class homes, the past few years have seen a rapid pivot toward online streaming -- a trend exacerbated by the pandemic. Reliance will be using its IPL rights as a tactical asset to build out streaming and digital platforms including Voot, Jio and others, this person said. Viacom18 has already secured media rights in soccer, badminton, tennis and basketball events, giving it a diverse portfolio of sports assets. IPL’s streaming rights will propel Viacom18’s position in the local OTT market, according to Jai Lala, chief executive officer at media consultancy Zenith. “It will help Viacom18 to command better market share from its current No. 4 position, but it has to generate adequate content to engage subscribers when there are no cricket matches,"" he said.

The global brokerage's upgrade of RIL share price's rating to overweight from Neutral is driven by global view of strong refining environment though we build in a decline in product cracks from current levels, and RIL's non-Energy business valuations continuing to hold up. It has a June 2023 price target of ₹3,170 (from ₹2,575 earlier). ""We expect RIL’s outperformance to continue (RIL has outperformed the NIFTY by 21% YTD), given the upside risk to consensus earnings estimates. We increase our FY23-24 EPS estimates by 19%/17%,"" the note stated. The brokerage's earnings estimates imply a sharp pullback in diesel and gasoline cracks from current record level, but RIL remains among the best positioned refiners globally, given ability to buy and process arbitrage barrels, diesel heavy slate, and export focus. The upstream business should benefit from rising domestic gas prices and higher volumes, as per JPMorgan. Why an upgrade now?  “While higher Oil and GRMs are a positive, we had earlier expected the global Tech sell-off to impact RIL’s consumer valuations negatively (Jio, Retail) and cancel out the nearterm earnings upside. RIL's consumer valuations have held up well and with likely higher ARPU’s and further ramp-up of Retail footprint, combined with Renewables business optionality, the Non Energy Business valuations should hold up going forward even as Consolidated reported earnings should improve materially from here on Refining and E&P,"" the brokerage added. Though, the key risks, as per JPMorgan include fall in Refining margins to January 2022 levels, and sharp decline in consumer business valuations. ""While RIL's product hedging means there is unlikely to be a complete pass-through of spot cracks, overall we see the O2C business reporting improving profits for the next few quarters. While PE spreads remain weak, strong PX should result in steady Petrochem profits,"" it said. The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint."

Updated: 14 Jun 2022,Centre weighs appeal against UK court order in RIL-BG case,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/india-considers-appeal-against-english-court-s-order-on-ril-shell-arbitration-award-11655133415184.html,"NEW DELHI : The Union government is considering challenging the English high court’s verdict favouring a $111 million arbitration award to Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and Shell-owned BG Exploration and Production India Ltd. On 9 June, India lost an appeal in the English high court against the arbitration award to Reliance Industries Ltd and BG Exploration related to production-sharing contracts concerning the Tapti and Panna-Mukta offshore oil fields. In a statement on Monday, the Union ministry of petroleum and natural gas said: “The government of India has the right to seek leave of the English Commercial Court to challenge this judgment passed by it."" The matter is connected with Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields, where the Centre had executed two production-sharing contracts (PSCs) with Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd, Reliance Industries and Enron (BG Exploration and Production India Ltd) on 22 December 1994. Disputes arose between the parties, which were referred to arbitration for resolution in 2010. So far, the arbitral tribunal has passed eight substantial partial awards. The ministry said that 66 of the 69 issues were decided in favour of the government in the final partial award passed by the tribunal in 2016. Pursuant to the award, the Centre issued a demand letter to Reliance Industries and BG Exploration, calling upon them to pay an amount of $3.85 billion, excluding interest. The ministry said that the companies failed to make the payment as per the award. The government has also filed an application for execution of the final partial award 2016 before the Delhi high court. The matter dates back to 2010, when the companies dragged India to arbitration over cost recovery provisions and profits due to the government, among other dues. They sought to raise the limit of costs that could be recovered from the sale of oil and gas before profits were shared with the government. In October 2016, an arbitration panel issued a final partial award (FPA) upholding the Centre’s view that the profit from the fields should be calculated after deducting the prevailing tax of 33% and not the 50% rate that existed earlier. The panel also held that the cost recovery is fixed at $545 million in the Tapti gas field and $577.5 million in Panna-Mukta, turning down the appeal to raise the cost provision by $365 million and $62.5 million in Tapti and Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, respectively. Queries sent to spokespeople for Reliance and Shell remained unanswered till press time. The Centre has been involved in long-drawn arbitration battles, including against British energy giant Cairn and telecom major Vodafone Group Plc. Both these matters, however, pertained to retrospective taxation. The government last year brought in the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2021 to amend the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the Finance Act of 2012, nullifying the retrospective taxation that was introduced with the Finance Act of 2012, thereby making way for settlement of protracted arbitration. In the case of Cairn Energy, the Indian government has paid the company ₹7,900 crore to refund taxes it had collected to enforce a retrospective tax demand. Vodafone Group had, in December last year, said that it had filed an application with the government to settle its ₹20,000 crore retrospective tax dispute. In January last year, an arbitration tribunal ruled in favour of the two oil and gas companies. In its partial final award, the tribunal awarded around $111 million of the total of $260 million sought by them. India then challenged the award under sections 68 and 69 of the Arbitration Act 1996 of Britain. The court, in its judgement last week, dismissed India’s argument under section 68. India had claimed that the tribunal’s failure to apply principles of Indian constitutional law caused “substantial injustice""."

The domestic equities also tracked global woes as investors betted cautiously ahead of US Fed and European Central Bank policy. Following this, more than ₹5.16 lakh crore of investors' wealth has been wiped out from Dalal Street. Nearly half of the total losses were seen in the top -10 most valued companies.

The inflation data will be crucial to sense the quantum of a rate hike. European Central Bank in its policy meeting signaled to start rate hike from next month and a large change in September. Persisted foreign fund outflow and widening trade deficit due to the elevated oil prices led to depreciation of INR, weakening the sentiment."" The top ten most valued companies accounted for nearly half of the losses witnessed on Dalal Street.

Updated: 12 Jun 2022,Govt loses challenge to $111 mn arbitration award in dispute with RIL and Shell,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/govt-loses-challenge-to-111-mn-arbitration-award-in-dispute-with-ril-and-shell-11655012805941.html,"The government has lost its appeal in the English High Court against a $111 million arbitration award in favour of Reliance Industries Ltd and Shell in a cost recovery dispute in the western offshore Panna-Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields. High Court judge Ross Cranston on June 9, 2022 ruled that the government should have brought its objections over the arbitration tribunal not meeting the required thresholds, when issuing the 2021 award earlier, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. Rejecting the government's arguments, the court said the objections are barred by an English law principle whereby a party cannot raise matters in new proceedings that could have been raised in earlier proceedings. While an email sent to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas for comments remained unanswered, officials said the government will study the court order and look for appropriate forums for remedy. A separate email sent to Reliance for comments too remained unanswered. Reliance and Shell-owned BG Exploration & Production India on December 16, 2010, dragged the government to arbitration over cost recovery provisions, profit due to the State and amount of statutory dues including royalty payable. They wanted to raise the limit of cost that could be recovered from sale of oil and gas before profits are shared with the government. The government of India also raised counter claims over expenditure incurred, inflated sales, excess cost recovery, and short accounting. A three-member arbitration panel headed by Singapore-based lawyer Christopher Lau by majority issued a final partial award (FPA) on October 12, 2016. It upheld the government view that the profit from the fields should be calculated after deducting the prevailing tax of 33 per cent and not the 50 per cent rate that existed earlier. It also upheld that the cost recovery in the contract is fixed at $ 545 million in Tapti gas field and $ 577.5 million in Panna-Mukta oil and gas field. The two firms wanted that cost provision be raised by $ 365 million in Tapti and $ 62.5 million in Panna-Mukta. Royalty, it said, had to be calculated after inclusion of marketing margin charged over and above the wellhead price of natural gas. The government used this award to seek $ 3.85 billion in dues from Reliance and BG Exploration & Production India Ltd (BGEPIL). The two firms challenged the 2016 FPA before the English High Court, which on April 16, 2018, remitted one of the challenged issues back to the Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. The arbitration tribunal ruled in favour of the two in a January 29, 2021 award. ""The Arbitral Tribunal decided in favour of the Claimants (Reliance and BGEPIL) in large part vide its final partial award dated October 1, 2018. Government of India and Claimants filed an appeal before the English Commercial Court against this 2018 FPA,"" Reliance had said in its annual report last year. ""The English Commercial Court rejected GoI's challenges to the 2018 Final Partial Award and upheld Claimants' challenge that the Arbitration Tribunal had jurisdiction over the limited issue and remitted the issue back to the Arbitration Tribunal,"" it added. The final award on the issue came in January 2021, it had stated. Subsequently, both sides filed clarification applications before the tribunal, which on April 9, 2021 granted minor corrections requested by Reliance and Shell and rejected all of the government's clarification requests. Thereafter, the government challenged the award before the English High Court. The court gave its ruling on June 9, 2022, they said. The government had used the 2016 partial award not just to raise a $ 3.85 billion demand on Reliance and Shell but also sought to block Reliance's proposed $ 15 billion deal with Saudi Aramco on grounds that the company owed money to it. Following this, the court asked company directors to file affidavits listing assets. Reliance and Shell had countered the government petition in the Delhi High Court saying the petition is an abuse of process as no arbitration award has fixed any final liability of dues on the company. ""GoI has also filed an execution petition before the Delhi High Court... seeking enforcement and execution of the 2016 FPA,"" the annual report had said. ""The Claimants contend that GoI's Execution Petition is not maintainable."" The government's Execution Petition is currently sub judice. ""Claimants have also filed an application for recall /modification, challenging the Orders of Delhi High Court wherein directors were directed to file affidavits of assets. The matter is listed on July 13, 2021, for hearing,"" it had said. The Panna-Mukta (primarily an oil field) and Mid & South Tapti (gas field) are shallow-water fields located in the offshore Bombay basin. Discovered by state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), they were bid out in 1994 to a consortium of ONGC (40 per cent), Reliance (30 per cent) and Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd (30 per cent). In February 2002, BGEPIL acquired Enron's 30 per cent stake in the joint venture. BGEPIL was subsequently taken over by Shell. The production sharing contract (PSC) for the fields stipulated deducting costs incurred on field operations from oil and gas sold before sharing profit with the government. Disallowing certain items in the cost would result in higher profit petroleum for the government. Reliance and BGEPIL sought raising of cost recovery limit through arbitration.

The consortium has valued the assets in the range of $7-8 billion. Banks: ICICI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, and Bank of India raised their external reference benchmarks, used largely for pricing retail loans, on Thursday, a day after the Reserve Bank of India increased its key rate for the second time in as many months to tame inflation. Mortgage lender HDFC has also announced that it will raise its Retail Prime Lending Rate (RPLR) on housing loans by 50 basis points, effective 10 June. IIFL Finance Ltd: Abu Dabhi Investment Authority has agreed to pay ₹2,200 crore to acquire a 20% stake in IIFL Home Finance, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IIFL Finance, in one of the largest equity investments in the affordable housing finance segment in India. IIFL Home Finance will use the additional capital to continue its granular expansion strategy into new markets to address the significant and growing demand for housing loans. Yes Bank: The new board of Yes Bank Ltd will decide on the capital raising plan that the private lender has been considering since last year. Sunil Mehta, the bank’s outgoing chairman, has said that the board initiated talks with potential investors to raise as much as ₹10,000 crore as part of the restructuring scheme. He also said the new asset reconstruction company would be formed by September. Bajaj Auto: The two-wheeler maker has said that its board of directors on 14 June 14 will consider a proposal for buyback of fully paid-up equity shares of the company. This seems to be the first buyback announcement, if any, by the company since 2000. Coal India: With power demand surging along with rising mercury, Coal India has floated an international tender, seeking bids for import of 2.416 million tonne of coal. Dr Reddy's Laboratories: Has said its subsidiary has inked a pact with US-based Olema Pharmaceuticals Inc to research, develop and commercialise novel small molecule inhibitors of an undisclosed oncology target.

HFCL: Has received orders worth ₹73.39 crore consisting of ₹51.09 crore from one of the leading private telecom operators of the country for supply of UBRs (unlicensed band radio) along with accessories.

Updated: 09 Jun 2022,"Apollo, Reliance Industries consortium to make binding bid for Boots",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/apollo-reliance-industries-consortium-to-make-binding-bid-for-boots-11654764806904.html,"A consortium of Apollo Global Management Inc. and Reliance Industries Ltd. has made a binding offer for Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.’s international arm, people with knowledge of the matter said. The investor group submitted a bid for the Boots drugstore chain this week that’s fully backed by committed financing, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Their proposal values Boots at more than £5 billion ($6.3 billion), one of the people said.  The move could put Apollo and Reliance in pole position to buy Boots, after rival suitors started having second thoughts. Their main competitor, a consortium of Britain’s billionaire Issa brothers and TDR Capital, has been considering dropping out of the race due to disagreements over price, Bloomberg News reported in late May.  Walgreens has been seeking a valuation of about £7 billion for Boots, people with knowledge of the matter have said. The business runs a network of more than 2,200 stores across the UK, as well as private-label brands like No7 Beauty Co. and operations in a smattering of other countries.  Reliance, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, may be looking to tap its expertise in emerging markets to wring further growth out of the British high street staple. Ambani, who is one of India’s richest men, is in the midst of pivoting his traditionally refining-focused conglomerate toward businesses that will better help him tap the country’s billion-plus consumers.  A winning bidder could be picked as soon as the coming weeks, the people said. Walgreens plans to keep a stake in the business after any deal, according to the people.  Deliberations are ongoing, and there’s no certainty they will lead to a transaction. Representatives for the consortium and Walgreens declined to comment. The Boots sale has emerged as a litmus test for dealmaking in the UK as credit markets become increasingly fragile. The easy financing conditions that supported a series of debt-fueled takeovers of British companies last year have mostly come to an end. Banks that funded the private-equity buyout of Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc had to sell some of the debt at a steep discount.

Updated: 09 Jun 2022,"Sensex jumps 428 pts, Nifty ends above 16,450; RIL, DRL shine, Tata Steel drags",https://www.livemint.com/market/live-blog/share-market-live-updates-sensex-nifty-bse-nse-stock-market-today-09-06-2022-wipro-pnb-vedanta-yes-bank-tata-power-11654738139336.html,"Indian indices on Thursday ended in the green as both the Sensex and Nifty gyrated between gains and losses amid weak Asian trends. Indices remained volatile for most part of the day as investors were worried that aggressive policy tightening by central banks could stifle global economic growth. However, in the noon trade, the indices made smart recovery. European equities slipped ahead of a European Central Bank decision that will put the region’s monetary policy on a path of tightening and help close the gap with global peers. Oil prices hovered near three-month highs on Thursday after parts of Shanghai imposed new Covid-19 lockdown measures. Shares were flat in Japan and South Korea, while it fell in Hong Kong, Australia, and Shanghai.  Indian indices on Thursday closed higher, snapping 4-day losing streak, led by buying support in pharma, energy, and IT stocks.  The Sensex advanced 427.79 points, or 0.78%, to close at 55,320.28, while Nifty50 gained 121.85 points to end at 16,478.10. Sectorally, metal stocks came under heavy selling pressure, while IT, energy, and telecom sectors ended in the green. On the 30-stock index, the most gains were made by Reliance, DRL, Airtel, and TechM, among others, while Tata Steel, UltraTech, and NTPC were among the biggest losers. On Nifty50, DRL, BPCL, and Reliance made the most gains, while Tata Steel, Grasim, and Shree Cement were among the biggest laggards.   Global wealth rose 10.6% last year to reach a record high of $530 trillion in 2021 and is set to continue rising in all regions despite inflationary pressures and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Strong equity markets and a surge in demand for real assets such as property, wine and art drove the increase, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group. About $80 trillion of new wealth is likely to be created over the next five years. “Wealth development is resoundingly resilient, and even against the backdrop of geopolitical turmoil the growth rate will remain positive,"" said Anna Zakrzewski, global leader of BCG’s wealth management arm.   China’s trade growth rebounded in May after anti-virus restrictions that shut down Shanghai and other industrial centers began to ease.   The rupee slipped 13 paise to hit its intra-day record low of 77.81 against the US dollar on Thursday, weighed down by elevated crude oil prices and persistent foreign capital outflows. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 77.74 against the American dollar, then fell further and touched its intra-day record low of 77.81, registering a fall of 13 paise from the last close. On Wednesday, the rupee recovered from its record low to close 10 paise higher at 77.68 against the American currency. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday raised the key interest rate by 50 basis points, the second increase in five weeks, to rein in the rise in prices that it saw continuing to hurt consumers in the near term.   Repo rate hiked further, MPC focused on containing inflation: MPC unanimously voted to further hike policy repo rate by 50bps to 4.9%. It remains focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure inflation is contained within the target while supporting growth. There is a change in the commentary from ‘withdrawal of ultraaccommodative’ stance to ‘withdrawal of accommodative’ and that upside risks to inflation persists, and appear more hawkish. The move reflects reversal of rate action in 2020 and also points towards further rate hikes during the year and get closer towards the pre-pandemic repo rate. No CRR hike: Post CRR hike of 50bps in May (that would have sucked systemic liquidity to the extent of Rs870bn), systemic liquidity has moderated. There was no further hike in CRR. While normalising the pandemic related extraordinary liquidity accommodation, RBI will ensure adequate liquidity to meet the productive requirements. Will trigger further increase in deposit and lending rates: Recently, post repo rate hike in May, MCLRs were hiked by 10-30bps by leading banks. Banks have also raised deposit rates across maturity buckets with peak retail TD rates being at 5.75%. Also, wholesale peak TD rates are in the range of 5.25-5.75% for leading private banks. Now with another 50bps repo rate hike, rates will be further revised upwards.   We believe cloud opportunities will be beneficial for Indian IT service providers given – 1) 51% of IT spending in the areas of application software, infrastructure software, business process services and system infrastructure will shift to public cloud by CY25 (vs 41% in CY22), according to Gartner; 2) worldwide spending on public cloud services to increase from US$411bn in CY21 to US$495bn in CY22 with IaaS expected to grow the fastest (Gartner); and 3) cloud sustainability initiatives to start with leading cloud providers. Surge in cloud adoption could prove to be a growth lever for IT service providers on the back of cloud platforms created by them to help speed up cloud transformation journey of clients, thereby improving the utilisation of cloud capacity subscribed by clients, and thus, translating bookings into revenues for hyperscalers partners. With Indian IT players already building strong partnerships with hyperscalers, we believe pickup in spends on cloud transformation should make Indian IT a key beneficiary as well. Companies like TCS, INFY, HCLT and TECHM have developed strong organic cloud platforms and it is yielding good results. We believe among tier-2 players, MTCL, LTI and PSYS have strong collaborations and are expanding aggressively in cloud opportunities.   A consortium of Apollo Global Management Inc. and Reliance Industries Ltd. has made a binding offer for Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.’s international arm, people with knowledge of the matter said.   Shares of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) continued to decline with the stock hitting a new record low of ₹723 apiece on the BSE in Thursday's afternoon deals. The stock is now about 25% down from its IPO issue price of ₹949.   Our neutral stance on paint industry (and stocks) is intact - a function of our inability and unwillingness to subscribe to BAAP (buy at any price) as believed by some market participants. We actively cover most listed paint stocks. Ratings: ADD - Akzo Nobel; HOLD - Asian Paints, Indigo Paints, Kansai Nerolac; REDUCE - Berger Paints (based on valuation).   Witnessing positive momentum for the 15th straight month, equity mutual funds attracted a net sum of ₹18,529 crore in May amid heightened volatility in stock markets and consistent selling by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs).   The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday allowed credit cards to be linked with the unified payments interface (UPI), which will enable more people to make payments using the popular platform.   Most Asian and European markets fell Thursday as a rally in oil ramped up inflation fears, with top officials warning of more pain to come as the Ukraine war continues to push prices up and put further pressure on the global economy. Buyers on Wall Street were in retreat again after data showed US crude and gasoline stockpiles sank, just as the summer driving season begins and a leading OPEC member warned demand would surge further as China reopens. Adding to the gloom was the OECD's sharp downward revision of its global growth outlook and doubling of its inflation forecast. The glum mood was only slightly offset by ongoing optimism that Beijing's tech crackdown was close to an end.   We estimate 20-22% CAGR in CIF and Receivables over FY22-24. Despite modelling 25 bps MDR reduction (partial recoup through opex), we estimate RoA/RoE to be 5.5-6%/24-26% which was the pre-pandemic metric (adjusted for capital base). We believe that stock price represents overstretched concerns on a) MDR reduction and lack of flexibility to recoup it, b) structural pressure on cost-income/profitability from increased competitive intensity, c) impact on growth from rising scale of the new-age card cos. and BNPL. Being the only listed pure-play credit card issuer with significantly higher profitability than Banks and NBFCs (in good times as well as bad times), SBI Cards would continue to command a premium valuation. Reiterate BUY with 12m PT of Rs1260.   Outstanding credit cards in the system in April grew 20.7% year-on-year to 75.2 million, the highest in the past 25 months, according to Digital Payments tracker report from Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.   Shares of BLS International rallied about 10% to ₹195 apiece on the BSE in Thursday's early session after the company announced the acquisition of business correspondent Zero Mass Private Limited (ZMPL) for ₹120 crore in an all-cash deal.   Notwithstanding the inflation worries, the housing cycle continues to gather strength, said Jefferies, adding that the rising rates are associated with a booming property market and the other way around and rising prices, low inventory and strong affordability imply durability should add ~1ppt/ year to India's GDP growth rate over next 5 years.   The Indian stock market's benchmark Sensex was witnessing volatile trading with negative bias on Thursday dragged by selling pressure in infra, banking, and IT stocks. The 30 stock S&P BSE Sensex was trading 34.73 points or 0.06 per cent down at 54,857.76 points at 11.36 am, against its previous day's close at 54,892.49 points. Earlier, the Sensex started the day in the red at 54,514.17 points and slumped to a low of 54,507.41 points in the early morning trade. The Sensex turned positive in the late morning session rising to a high of 55,010.89 points. The Sensex is trading in the negative for the fifth straight session. The index had lost 214.85 points or 0.39 per cent on Wednesday.   The Indian rupee hit a record low against the U.S. dollar on Thursday as the relentless surge in global crude oil prices raised concerns of a sustained rise in imported inflation, while weakness in domestic shares also hurt. The partially convertible rupee was trading at 77.78/79 per dollar after touching a record low of 77.81. The previous life low of 77.7975 was touched on May 17. Oil prices held firm near 13-week highs on Thursday after China reported stronger-than-expected exports in May, although new Shanghai lockdown restrictions capped gains.   The yen dropped to a new 20-year low versus the dollar on Thursday, and the euro inched higher ahead of a highly-anticipated meeting of the European Central Bank, which should offer insights into its monetary policy tightening plans. The ECB is all but certain to flag an end to its long-running asset purchase programme at the end of this month, and promise a rate hike for July, but the size and pace of its tightening are uncertain.   State-owned CIL on Thursday said that it has floated its maiden tender to import 2.416 million tonnes of coal to ensure adequate supply of the fuel to power plants in the country. The development assumes significance in the wake of the government making all efforts to build up stock of coal to avoid the reoccurrence of power outages, which happened in April on account of shortage of the fossil fuel. ""In a first-ever, Coal India Limited (CIL) on Wednesday floated an international competitive bidding e-tender, seeking bids for import of 2.41,6 million tonnes of coal,"" the company said in a statement.   Shares of AU Small Finance Bank started trading ex-bonus in Thursday's trading session, a day ahead of the record date for its bonus shares issue. AU Small Finance Bank shares plunged nearly 2% to ₹617 apiece on the BSE in today's early deals.   American Airlines and IndiGo have launched a codeshare agreement that allows the former to sell seats on the latter's flights operating on Delhi-Bengaluru and Delhi-Mumbai routes, a statement said on Thursday.   London copper prices crept lower on Thursday ahead of a monetary policy decision by the European Central Bank, although better-than-expected economic data out of top consumer China raised hopes of a demand recovery amid declining inventories. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was down 0.3% at $9,697 a tonne, as of 0518 GMT. The most-traded July copper contract in Shanghai was up 0.1% at 72,800 yuan ($10,885.39) a tonne by the midday break.   Gold prices in India struggled near three-week lows amid firm US bond yields that lower the safe-haven appeal of zero-yielding gold. On MCX, gold futures were flat at ₹51,070 per 10 gram while silver edged up to ₹62,059 per kg. In global markets, gold prices slipped today ahead of key US inflation data, due later this week. Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1,852.21 per ounce, amid firm US 10-year Treasury yields.   Shares of Deepak Nitrite have fallen about 13% in the last five trading sessions amid reports of Gujarat govt issuing closure notice to chemical intermediate maker Deepak Nitrite over Nandesari explosions, on which the stock exchanges have also sought clarification.   The rupee slipped 10 paise to 77.78 against the US dollar in early trade on Thursday, as elevated crude oil prices and persistent foreign capital outflows weighed on investor sentiments. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 77.74 against the American dollar, then lost ground to quote at 77.78, registering a fall of 10 paise from the last close. On Wednesday, the rupee recovered from its record low to close 10 paise higher at 77.68 against the American currency. Rupee is hovering around its lifetime low of 77.78 against the US dollar tracking the strength of the American currency in the overseas market and firm crude oil prices. Rupee opened on a bearish note as crude oil neared USD 125 per barrel, Anil Kumar Bhansali, Head of Treasury, Finrex Treasury Advisors, said.   Indian stock markets' key indices, Sensex and Nifty, opened with minor cuts on Thursday amid subdued global sentiment. The 30 stock S&P BSE Sensex was trading 186.05 points or 0.34 per cent down at 54,706.44 points at 9.38 am. The broader Nifty 50 of the National Stock Exchange was trading 52.50 points or 0.32 per cent down at 16,303.80 points. MRPL rose 3.50 per cent to ₹121.55, Raymond rose 30.20 per cent to ₹1,008.90, Blissgvs, Biocon, and JKIL were among the major Sensex gainers. PhoenixLTD, Deepakni, EmamiLTD, Dwarkesh, and MotilalOFS were among the major Sensex losers.   According to the brokerage firm Sharekhan, the consumer goods sector's Q4FY2022 performance was impacted by a slowdown in consumer demand, which impacted sales volume, and a sharp increase in raw-material prices, which impacted operating profit margin (OPM), after which the brokerage selected good quality stocks like Marico, Tata Consumer Products, HUL, Nestle India, Asian Paints, and Zydus Wellness as top stock picks to buy.   Most companies announced dividends following the Q4 results of the current financial year, but it is important to note that one should look at companies that are virtually debt-free and have a continuous record of paying dividends. As dividends are a wonderful way to make passive income, buying high-quality stocks is a solid strategy. As a consequence, here are three Mahindra group companies that will pay dividends soon.   6 stocks to buy today — 9th June   In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin price today plunged below $31,000 level after rising above the mark in the previous session. The world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency plunged more than 3% and was trading at $30,173. The digital token is down more than 34% so far this year (YTD), and is trading far below its record high of $69,000 it had hit in November last year.   Back in February, when India was still in denial about its brewing inflation challenge, economists at Nomura Holdings Inc. summarized the choices before the monetary authority into three neat boxes. First, they said, there was a 15% probability that the central bank was right to ignore supply-side pressures. But their base case, to which they assigned a 50% likelihood, was that the Reserve Bank of India was wrong and it would have to pivot to containing price increases. They did consider a third possibility to which they gave a fairly significant 35% chance: that the RBI, although wrong about inflation, would simply go on to tolerate it.   Gold inched lower on Thursday, with prices restrained by rising Treasury yields ahead of key U.S. jobs and inflation data this week. FUNDAMENTALS * Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1,852.21 per ounce, as of 0052 GMT, while U.S. gold futures also eased 0.1% to $1,853.90. * Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields firmed on Thursday, lowering the appeal of zero-yield gold.  * SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings rose 0.22% to 1,065.39 tonnes on Wednesday from 1,063.06 tonnes on Tuesday.   Asian stocks fell, U.S. bond yields rose and a soaring dollar pushed to a two-decade high against the yen on Thursday as investors worried about the outlook for more rate rises ahead of a key meeting of the European Central Bank later in the day. But before the meeting, at which the ECB is set to bring to an end its Asset Purchase Programme and signal rate hikes to combat rising inflation, moves in the Asian session were relatively muted as many investors kept to the sidelines.   Indian economy is projected to cross $5 trillion in 2026-27 and likely to become $20 trillion by 2040, Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said on Wednesday.   The top US securities regulator on Wednesday unveiled a planned overhaul of Wall Street retail stock trading rules, aiming to boost competition for handling orders by commission-free brokerages to ensure mom-and-pop investors get the best price for trades. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler said he wants to require trading firms to directly compete to execute trades from retail investors. The Wall Street watchdog plans to scrutinize growth in recent years of the payment for order flow (PFOF) practice, which is banned in Canada, the UK and Australia.   US stocks fell on Wednesday as Treasury yields rose above the psychologically important 3% level and oil prices jumped, fanning worries about inflation and the outlook for interest rates. The S&P 500 ended down more than 1% in the broad sell-off, snapping a two-day winning streak. Among its biggest drags, shares of Intel Corp slid 5.3% after Citi cut its estimates on the chipmaker for the second time in a week. Citi pointed to uncertainty about demand for personal computers and predicted the company could pre-announce weaker-than-expected earnings for the second quarter. Other chip shares also fell. Brent crude oil prices rose above $123 a barrel and hit a 13-week high, while the Dow Jones transportation average fell 3.8%, significantly underperforming the other main indexes on the day. The S&P 500 energy sector was the only sector to end higher.   Tokyo stocks trended higher Thursday, with a lower yen buoying exporters despite overnight falls of US shares. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.22 percent, or 61.85 points, at 28,296.14, while the broader Topix index rose 0.24 percent, or 4.67 points, to 1,974.65. The yen's weakness against major currencies continued to provide solid support for shares of Tokyo exporters, analysts said, although the overall market could take a breather after recent gains. The dollar stood at 134.41 yen, around a 20-year high, against 134.29 yen overnight in New York. Wall Street shares fell on lingering worries about inflation while US yields trended higher.   Hong Kong stocks rose at the start of trade Thursday morning as another pick-up in tech firms helped traders brush off a drop on Wall Street. The Hang Seng Index rose 0.49 percent, or 106.94 points, to 22,121.53. The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.13 percent, or 4.30 points, to 3,259.49, while the Shenzhen Composite Index on China's second exchange slipped 0.24 percent, or 5.03 points, to 2,078.39.   Stocks wavered in Asia on Thursday and bonds were again on the back foot, weighed down by the impact of high inflation. Equities were mixed in Japan and fell in Australia and South Korea. Hong Kong may offer a modicum of relief from an ongoing rally in Chinese tech shares that’s predicated on an easing regulatory crackdown and loosening Covid curbs. US futures fluctuated after Wall Street snapped a two-day rally on a climb in oil past $122 a barrel that stoked worries about rising costs and monetary tightening. Benchmark Treasury yields held above 3% and New Zealand’s 10-year yield touched the highest level in seven years. The dollar-yen pair is dominating foreign-exchange markets, with the weakness in Japan’s currency putting the 2002 high of 135.15 in play. Markets remain fixated on the risk of a downturn triggered by interest-rate hikes across much of the world to quell price pressures. The OECD added to the gloom with a warning that the global economy will pay a “hefty price"" for Russia’s war in Ukraine in the form of weaker growth, stronger inflation and potentially long-lasting damage to supply chains.

Updated: 06 Jun 2022,"India plans to reduce green hydrogen costs, seeks cheap finance",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-plans-to-reduce-green-hydrogen-costs-seeks-cheap-finance-11654501608146.html,"India seeks to reduce the cost of producing green hydrogen to $1 per kilogramme from $5-$6 at present in order to encourage industry to utilise greener energy, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. India also wants access to cheaper financing to help fund the transformation.  In February, the world's third-largest carbon emitter unveiled a plan to become a centre for the production and export of green hydrogen, a fuel generated from water and renewable electricity, though the fuel is still far from commercial viability. “Unless cheap finance is available to be able to rapidly enhance both renewable and non-renewable, this transition will be difficult to speed up for a long period of time,"" said Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant. “Finances at low costs are critical."" In January, Mukesh Ambani - the chairman of Reliance Industries - announced intentions to invest $75 billion in renewable energy infrastructure, including power plants, solar panels, and electrolyzers. It's becoming increasingly likely that the idea incorporates converting all of that renewable energy into hydrogen, which would be one of the most significant endorsements for the next-generation fuel. According to analysts, Reliance Industries is likely to choose hydrogen to sidestep India's wholesale energy market, which is controlled by financially distressed companies and plagued by late payments. New Delhi wants global funders including the World Bank to structure guarantee programs to help access funds at low rates, Amitabh Kant said. Green hydrogen will be used to decarbonize “hard-to-abate"" sectors like refiners, fertiliser makers and steel producers, he said. India, one of the world's largest importers of fossil fuels, is also looking to reduce its dependency on oil, since its import bill is set to nearly treble to $300 billion in the next decade, according to Amitabh Kant. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced intentions in November to make India a net zero carbon emitter by 2070 and a 50 percent renewable energy consumer by the end of the decade, prompting policy changes. It needs about $25 billion to create a domestic supply chain with national installed electrolyser capacity of 25 GW producing 5 MT of Green Hydrogen by 2030, according to the India Hydrogen Alliance, which counts Reliance Industries Ltd. and JSW Steel Ltd among members. India will continue to focus on electrifying two and three-wheelers as well as public buses, Amitabh Kant said. The government will not push for electrification of four wheelers in the Indian market given private sector interest, he said. As it is, the cost of electrifying transport is expected to fall after India’s recent tender for more than 5,000 electric buses got bids at prices cheaper than diesel and combustion buses, Amitabh Kant said.

The Walgreen Boots Alliance, which operates US drugstore chain Walgreens and Boots in the UK and EU, was reportedly asking for $8.8 billion, while bidders had estimated the chain’s value at around $6 billion. Why Walgreens is hiving off Boots is easy to see. The US pharma chain needs the cash as it strives to pivot into the higher-margin health and wellness space. Brexit has also complicated matters for the UK-based Boots, which has a strong presence in several other EU markets, as well as in Thailand and Indonesia in Asia. Why Ambani is pitching for Boots, however, is more difficult to see. So far, Reliance’s acquisitions have been largely focused on bolstering its existing businesses and beefing up and plugging gaps in its domestic retail portfolio as it readies to take on rivals Tatas and Adanis in the physical retail space, as well as tackling Amazon and Walmart-Flipkart in the e-commerce space.
