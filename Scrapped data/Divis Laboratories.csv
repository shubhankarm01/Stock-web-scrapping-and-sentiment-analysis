Updated: 13 Jan 2021,"Divi’s Lab, one of best performing large-cap stocks, sees wave of bullish calls",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/divis-lab-one-of-best-performing-large-cap-stocks-sees-wave-of-bullish-calls-11610526127030.html,"Some analysts are turning even more bullish on India’s best-performing large-cap stock in 2020. In just about two weeks, at least four brokerages have raised their price targets on Divi’s Laboratories Ltd., one of the top producers of active pharmaceutical ingredients, with Jefferies India Pvt.’s estimate -- which targets a 21% gain over the next 12 months from current levels -- being the most bullish in data compiled by Bloomberg. The optimism is stemming from the firm’s capacity-expansion plans and potential to win more business as India cuts its reliance on Chinese suppliers. Divi’s has started building a production facility near Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh, it said in an exchange filing last month. Second-quarter earnings topped estimates in early November. “Capital discipline has been one of the hallmarks of this company,"" said Siddhant Khandekar, an analyst at ICICIdirect.com. “Divi’s is known for optimum utilization of capital. There must be tangible orders on hand and that is why they are spending."" Overall in absolute terms, analysts’ average 12-month target price for Divi’s stock has risen about ₹134 in the past four weeks, the biggest increase among 10 companies on the MSCI India Health Care Index. The stock currently has 17 buy ratings, two holds and three sell recommendations, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “The stock could carry its momentum into this year,"" said Tushar Manudhane, an analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. in Mumbai. “They have a good track record of using new capacity efficiently."" Valuation jump Still, potential advance in the share price over the next 12 months is capped at about 21%, based on even the most bullish analyst’s estimate. That’s tiny compared to the stock’s 108% surge in 2020, which marked a fourth straight year of gains. One reason for that is valuation. Divi’s stock is now trading at almost 44 times its 12-month forward earnings, versus a five-year average multiple of 26.6, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It fell 1.5% to 3,710.20 rupees as of 1:31 p.m. in Mumbai Wednesday. Further, one risk that could resurface this year for Indian pharmaceutical companies overall is regulatory scrutiny. They were largely spared inspections by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2020, thanks to the pandemic. Unique Model That said, even as vaccine rollouts are prompting a rotation away from pandemic winners into beaten-down sectors, analysts see some trends working in Divi’s favor in the long run. “Divi’s, although expensive, continues to benefit from tailwinds favoring Indian companies in API manufacturing,"" Abhishek Sharma, an analyst at Jefferies in Mumbai, wrote in a note dated Jan. 5. Indian API exporters have been increasing their share of the U.S. market at the expense of Europe and China-based rivals, he wrote. Divi’s got almost 90% of its revenue from exports in the fiscal year ended March 2020. “The best part of this company is that it has been a play on both Contract Research & Manufacturing Services, or CRAMs, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs,"" said ICICIdirect.com’s Khandekar, “That is Divi’s identity. There are very few instances of this kind of a blended model among other pharma companies in India."" This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

Updated: 22 Oct 2020,Divis case: 8 people pay ₹3 cr to Sebi to settle alleged insider trading,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/divis-laboratories-8-people-pay-rs-3-crore-to-sebi-to-settle-alleged-insider-trading-11603383270151.html,"NEW DELHI : Eight individuals have paid a little over ₹3 crore to regulator Sebi to settle a case of alleged violation of insider trading norms in the scrip of Divis Laboratories Ltd. In addition to the settlement amount, the individuals also remitted ₹96.68 lakh as disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, Sebi said in a settlement order dated October 21. Divis Laboratories had made an announcement on July 10, 2017 on the exchange, which was an unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) in terms of Prohibition of Insider Trading norms.

Updated: 08 Sep 2020,Delhi HC says doctor prescription not mandatory for covid-19 testing,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/delhi-hc-says-doctor-prescription-not-mandatory-for-covid-19-testing-11599565674918.html,"The Delhi High Court on Tuesday said that doctor’s prescription is not mandatory for covid-19 testing in the capital. The rule will be applicable for RT/PCR test to detect COVID-19 infection. However, the person opting for voluntary testing is mandatorily required to carry his Aadhaar card with proof of Delhi address and needs to fill in the Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR) form for COVID-19 testing. The Delhi high court bench headed by Justice Hima Kohli asked the Delhi government to re-strategies the covid testing plans in order to ensure that any person who wants to get tested can do so without a prescription issued by a doctor. At present, it is mandatory to carry a doctor's prescription to get tested for coronavirus infection. Additional standing counsel Satyakam, appearing for Delhi government, apprised the bench also comprising Justice Subramonium Prasad that the state is already working on this. While seeking more time to put the details on record he submitted that the RT-PCR testing have been increased and mobile testing centers are in process of being set up at most of the bus terminals. The division bench also asked private laboratories to allow 2,000 COVID-19 tests a day for those who want to undergo the voluntarily screening. Capacity of around 12,000 test per day is available with the Delhi government, it noted. While observing the sharp rise in covid-19 positive cases in the last week, the court directed the Delhi government to consider setting up of covid testing centers in the proximity of metro stations in order to facilitate the commuters to get themselves tested as well. The court directed the state government to prepare maps marking the covid-19 testing centers in the capital. These maps have been directed to be shared with the Delhi Metro Rail corporation in order to be displayed at the metro stations for better awareness among general public. The slew of directions has been passed by the two-judge bench while hearing the plea filed by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking directions from the court for ramping up of test.

Updated: 23 Aug 2020,"Divi’s Labs’ outsourcing model drives its shares into Nifty, but they’re pricey",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/divi-s-labs-outsourcing-model-drives-into-nifty-but-stock-s-pricey-11598012201716.html,"This year, the pharma sector has been the poster boy of the stock market, with covid-19 wreaking havoc in stocks of many other sectors. Q1FY21 was a washout for most of India Inc., but pharma stocks have given sizeable returns. Divi’s Laboratories Ltd, though, stands out for another reason. Its research and contract-manufacturing divisions are being seen as subcategories that could drive efforts on research on a wider scale. Its share price has soared 112% in the past year. Another shot in the arm for Divi’s is that its stock is being included in the Nifty 50 index. Investors are seeing the generic active pharma ingredient segment as an opportunity, as pharma companies seek to diversify their supply chains outside China.  “This segment remains favourably exposed to the global outsourcing trend as big pharma companies focus on ‘core competencies’ with a tight control on development costs,"" said Goldman Sachs’ India analysts in a recent report. That said, the company’s Q1 growth has been decent, with revenue and operating profit outstripping the Street’s expectations. Revenue climbed 48% year-on-year (y-o-y) as both its generics and customs research categories stepped up smartly. The company also benefited from lower costs during the quarter, as well as benefits of scale, which provided the requisite fillip to its operating profits. Its Ebitda expanded 80% y-o-y in Q1. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. But investors have to watch out for some of the competitive risks to the business as well. About 47% of its revenue come from top-five molecules, which increases concentration risks in the business. Besides, while the API-diversification narrative and structural tailwinds are good for companies from India, price discounting due to stiff competition cannot be ruled out from global and domestic manufacturers. The company is nevertheless incurring capital expenditures of about ₹1,800 crore to commission new capacities, which will go on-stream in the second half of the year. Analysts said it will fuel growth for the next few years. “Historically, Divi’s is known to incur capex only when they have strong growth visibility,"" said Emkay Global Financial Services analysts in a note. Even so, the sentimental lift to pharma stocks has driven the stock price up far too much. Analysts said the stock’s valuations are about 50% higher over its historical average. Even factoring in a higher growth rate, the price-earnings multiple of about 36 times FY22 estimated earnings seems to be significantly on the higher side. That does not seem to leave enough upside room for now."
Updated: 06 Sep 2016,Divi’s proposed unit near Kakinada runs into resistance over land grab charges,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/Mo27un8OuxeOjbOIweVsaL/Divis-proposed-unit-near-Kakinada-runs-into-resistance-over.html," Hyderabad: Police on Tuesday removed dozens of locals and political activists—led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist)—from the site of a proposed Divis Laboratories factory near Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh after protests flared over allegations of land grab. An unspecified number of protesters were also arrested while they were trying to gather at the drug maker’s proposed factory at Thondangi mandal near Kakinada. Police took local YSR Congress Party legislator Dadisetti Raja in preventive custody before letting him off. Raja extended his support to the agitation against the upcoming plant, which is being opposed on grounds of alleged pollution and forcible acquisition of land. Hyderabad-based Divis Laboratories is investing Rs500 crore to set up the factory. “This will be the third large manufacturing facility for the company and will help de-risk its operations and achieve visible growth opportunities,"" said Murali K. Divi, chairman and managing director of the company, in a speech to shareholders at the company’s recent annual general meeting. The company said the new facility, expected to be operational in the second half of financial year 2017-18, will be funded through internal accruals. The proposed facility will be the sixth unit of Divis, which has five manufacturing units in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The Hyderabad-based company was allotted 505 acres of land by the Andhra Pradesh government near the coastal town Kakinada, and the company says it is in the process of obtaining approvals. However, land acquisition remains an unresolved issue, with local farmers refusing to part with their land. Locals also claim the factory will result in air and water pollution. A public hearing for the project was conducted amid tight security at Thondangi village in June. Divis manufactures generic active pharmaceutical ingredients or the key raw materials that go into making formulation drugs, custom synthesis of active ingredients for innovator companies, other speciality chemicals and nutraceuticals."

Divis posted a net profit of 1,108 crore for the year ended March, while revenues stood at 3,816 crore. Around three-fourths of its sales constitute supplies to regulated markets in Europe and the US. The company said it has cleared a US Food and Drug Administration inspection of its unit-2 in Visakhapatnam in February this year."
