Updated: 24 Jun 2022,Top picks: Sharekhan is bullish on these 6 cement stocks for robust gain ahead,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/top-picks-sharekhan-is-bullish-on-these-6-cement-stocks-for-robust-gain-ahead-11656089157281.html,"The leading brokerage firm Sharekhan has placed a buy call rating on the shares of Shree Cement for a target price (TP) of ₹26000, Ultratech Cement (TP: ₹7100), Grasim Industries (TP: ₹1740), The Ramco Cement (TP: ₹850), JK Lakshmi Cement (TP: ₹600), and Dalmia Bharat (TP: 1850). These recommendations were made because the brokerage forecasts that, in accordance with the plans disclosed by major cement players, the cement sector would add more than 90 mtpa in capacity between FY2023 and FY2025. The brokerage has said in a note that “Cement industry is expected to add over 90 mtpa in capacities over FY2023- FY2025 as per plans announced by major players. This implies a 5% CAGR in installed capacity, while cement demand is estimated to post a 6-7% CAGR over FY2023-FY2025. With the rise in supply almost equivalent to demand growth, industry capacity utilizations levels would stay almost flat at 67-68% over FY2023- FY2025. Pan-India cement prices have risen each year during FY2015-FY2022 barring a couple of years, while in Q1FY2023, they are up 8% as compared to FY2022 level. Going by historical anecdotes, we believe cement prices to remain on an uptrend despite capacity additions over the next three years. On the cost front, International petcoke prices have corrected by 17% m-o-m and 20% from March 2022 levels in June 2022."" According to Sharekhan “The diesel prices across Metros declined by 5% m-o-m while they were up 3% y-o-y in June 2022. We expect the easing of petcoke/ coal prices during Q1FY2023 and ahead to reflect in operational performance for the industry from H2FY2023 as it exhausts high-cost fuel inventory fully during H1FY2023. We estimate our cement coverage universe to report 11% CAGR in sales volume over FY2022-FY2024 as against industry growth estimated at 6-7% per annum. Higher-than-industry growth is expected to be lead by market share gains by larger companies aided by rise in capacities."" The brokerage has claimed that “We estimate weighted average EBITDA/tonne for our coverage universe to grow at 4% CAGR during FY2022- FY2024 although the same may remain lower than peaks seen in FY2021. The improvement in EBITDA/tone is based on our assumptions of capacity utilizations remaining almost flat due to high capacity additions, part retention of growth in cement prices and easing of energy and freight costs."" By staying positive on the cement sector, Sharekhan has said “Our cement coverage universe has seen 30%-45% correction in stock prices over trailing five months led by Russia-Ukraine crisis, rise in energy costs and large capacity plans announced by leading cement players. The same has led to one year forward EV/EBITDA valuation multiples of almost all cement companies sinking below their historical averages. Notwithstanding, soft earnings performance for the cement pack in H1FY23, the recent correction offers good entry points for long term investors as sustainable infrastructure push over next 3-5 years coupled with easing out of input cost pressure in H2FY23E would drive stock performance over next 12-15 months. We remain construction and stay Positive on the sector. Our preferred picks are UltraTech, Shree Cement, Dalmia Bharat and JK Lakshmi Cement."" Weakness in demand, a decline in cement prices and a rise in key input costs like energy and freight costs are key risks to the industry, said Sharekhan, which investors should take note of. The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.  "
Updated: 20 Jun 2022,Shree Cement’s new capex doesn’t excite,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/shree-cement-s-new-capex-doesn-t-excite-11655748076514.html,"Indian cement companies are announcing fresh capital expenditure (capex) plans amid biting cost pressures and subdued demand, with Shree Cement Ltd the latest to join the bandwagon. The company is setting up a clinker and cement plant with a capacity of 1.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) and 3 mtpa, respectively, in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh at a total cost of ₹2,500 crore, it said on Saturday. The company aims to commission the plant by December 2024. However, this has not enthused investors much. On Monday, the stock dropped to a 52-week low initially on NSE and closed about 2% higher than the previous close. Even so, several challenges are foreseen in pursuing these plans. Plus, capex in Andhra Pradesh is fraught with risks owing to excess capacity. “This capacity addition would cost Shree Cement ₹8,262 per tonne, much higher than the capex made in the past. Second, this plant is situated in Andhra Pradesh, which is an oversupply region where demand is muted. Thus, utilization levels are low. So this will be RoCE dilutive for Shree Cement,"" said Mangesh Bhadang, analyst at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities. RoCE is return on capital employed.      "

Updated: 31 May 2022,Another Adani Group stock may get included in Nifty 50 index,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/nifty-rejig-adani-enterprises-may-replace-shree-cements-in-nifty-50-index-11653974812632.html,"Edelweiss Alternative & Quantitative Research has carried out a pre-emptive analysis of the Semi-Annual Index (SAIR) September 2022 Rejig for Nifty indices. The index provider will officially announce the list in the second half of August 2022. According to the brokerage's preliminary analysis, Adani Enterprises holds a high chance to dislodge Shree Cements in the upcoming Nifty September review for the Nifty 50 index. The only risk factor is of any sharp contra price move in either of the probable names can lead to a change in conviction.  Adani Enterprises will be the second Adani Group stock, if included, in the Nifty 50 index. Currently, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited is part of the index. Shree Cements has a higher probability of being excluded from the Nifty index while the next name on radar, as per Edelweiss, would be Hero Motors. The cut-off date is July 29 whereas the announcement is expected to be in the second half of August and rebal date is September 30, 2022. On the other hand, Nifty Next 50 Index could see probable inclusions of Life Insurance Corporation (LICI), Tata Power, Adani Wilmer, IRCTC, Mphasis Ltd. While, probable exclusions in the index could be Lupin Ltd , Jubilant Foodworks, Zydus Lifesciences, Punjab National Bank (PNB), Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Adani Enterprises. For the Nifty Bank index, Edelweiss said “looks like Status quo. None of the stocks qualify yet, but any significant O/P by Canara Bank or U/P by PNB of 15% till mid of June, which if sustained till July end can lead to changes."" The most important criteria for Nifty 50 Inclusion is that the stock should compulsorily be part of the derivatives segment. For instance, average free float market cap of Avenue Supermarts (DMART), Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission is significantly higher than most of the existing Nifty 50 constituents, but the stock has not been included in the index for the past few reviews as they are not a part of the F&O segment.  If any of the above mentioned stock gets included in the derivatives segment till the expected announcement date, then it would make it to Nifty 50 index."

The company's operations span India and the UAE, with four integrated facilities in India, one in the UAE, and nine grinding units, and it is one of India's top three cement firms. Shree Cement's stock reached a 52-week low of ₹21,303.60 in intra-day trading on the BSE on Wednesday at around 1:34 PM (IST). The BSE Sensex was down 237 points at 53,815, while the NSE Nifty 50 fell below the 16,100 barrier in afternoon trade. The stock has been losing over the previous 5 days, falling 2.86 per cent in that time. Concerns over a drop in EBITDA owing to the high rise in power and fuel prices have also weighed on the stock. The stock has dropped 18.71 per cent in the last month, and it has dropped 20.12 per cent in the last six months. So far in 2022, the stock has lost 21.78 per cent YTD, and it has lost 21.19 per cent in the previous year. Shree Cement is now trading below its 5-, 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages. On the 24th of May, the delivery volume of 13.77 k fell by -17.58 per cent compared to the 5-day average delivery volume. Its latest trading price on the BSE was ₹21,292.95 down 1.5 per cent.

PAT increased by 2% YoY to INR 23,319 Mn in FY22, but PAT margins shrank by 132 basis points to 15.5 per cent. The brokerage firm KRChoksey has said that “In Q4FY22, Shree Cement commissioned its 3 mtpa grinding unit at Pune, taking its overall capacity to 46.4 mtpa. The company’s current utilization level stands at ~60% giving ample room for future growth by increasing its utilization level in subsequent quarters. The company is on track to achieve its target of 57 mtpa of capacity in next three years time. During Q4FY22, Shree Cement’s sales volume stood at 8 MT, a growth of 22.1% on QoQ basis.

Since our last result update, the stock price has corrected by 11.4% in line with overall market correction,"" said the brokerage. We continue to value the stock at 16x its FY24E EV/EBITDA, which yields a target price of INR 25,085 (previous TP of INR 27,978), giving an upside potential of 14.3% from the current market price.

Updated: 24 May 2022,"Capacity expansion of Shree Cement is on track, but near-term outlook is muted",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/nearterm-outlook-for-shree-cement-is-muted-11653334235019.html,"The March quarter earnings of Shree Cement Ltd, announced on Saturday, were hardly exciting. Hit by higher-than-expected input costs, standalone Ebitda at ₹910.6 crore in Q4FY22, was much lower than consensus estimate of ₹1,010.7 crore. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Muted cement prices in its key market of East India limited its ability to adequately pass on the burden of increased costs, said analysts. Consequently, the decline in operating margin continued. At 22.2%, its standalone operating margins fell to a three-year low in Q4FY22.         "
Updated: 19 May 2022,"The landscape of India’s cement oligopoly, in five charts",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/the-landscape-of-india-s-cement-oligopoly-in-five-charts-11652871713817.html,"Earlier this week, in a move that has significance for the Indian cement sector, the Adani Group announced its acquisition of Switzerland-based cement major Holcim’s Indian assets. In one shot, the Adani Group will catapult to the second spot in a sector that has historically demonstrated an oligopolistic character, with a handful of companies at the top controlling nearly half the capacity, and more. Here’s how that has played out in the last two decades or so, when the sector has grown faster than the economy and delivered market-beating returns. 1. Capacity control Between them, ACC and Ambuja have 65 million tonnes of annual cement manufacturing capacity. As a combine, this is next only to the 120 million tonnes of UltraTech, from the Aditya Birla Group. This troika has shaped the sector and led consolidation in it. Over 1999 and 2000, the Tata Group sold its stake in ACC to Ambuja. In 2005, Holcim entered Ambuja. In between these two transactions, Grasim (an Aditya Birla company) acquired the cement operations of L&T, which is UltraTech today. That was the initial consolidation in the sector at the top, one that has stuck. The top five cement manufacturers account for about 48% of the industry capacity of about 550 million tonnes and the top 10 about 63%. Their share in production will be higher, as their capacities usually operate at above-industry levels. While the industry has been languishing in the low-60% range, for instance, Ambuja did 86% utilization in calendar 2021 and UltraTech 70% in 2020-21.             "
Updated: 18 Apr 2022,What Holcim's likely exit from India means for cement sector's pricing power,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/what-holcim-s-likely-exit-from-india-means-for-cement-sector-s-pricing-power-11650268693591.html,"The cement sector is in the headlines, yet again, but this time, it is not for cost inflation pressure issues. Investors in the sector may need to prepare for the announcement of a landmark deal. Media reports said Switzerland-based building materials conglomerate Holderind Investments Ltd (Holcim) is looking to exit India and is exploring a stake sale in Ambuja Cements Ltd. Holcim holds a 63.19% stake in Ambuja and a 4.48% stake in ACC Ltd. It should be noted that Ambuja also holds a 50.05% stake in ACC. Clearly, if and when such a deal goes through, there would be repercussions not on these stocks but for other companies as well. For ACC and Ambuja a change of ownership could be a re-rating event, note analysts. Investors would reckon that both these companies have been losing market share due to capacity constraints. This is at a time when their close competitors Ultratech Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd were expanding their footprints across regions aggressively. During the calendar year 2011-2016, Holcim lost 460 basis points (bps) market share due to weaker capacity addition, according to Axis Securities Ltd. One basis point is 0.01%. During this period, Shree Cement and UltraTech added 220 bps and 630 bps of volume share, respectively, said the Axis report. Perhaps, a whiff of this potential deal has got investors excited. In April so far, the Ambuja stock has sharply outperformed peers ACC, Ultratech and the broader market, likely reflecting market anticipation for the merger & acquisition news, said analysts at Jefferies India. “In the near-term, while both these stocks may remain afloat on deal newsflows, driving outperformance versus other large-cap peers, Ambuja's recent sharp up-move tilts our preference towards ACC,"" added the Jefferies report. But a bigger near-term positive could come in the form of improved ability to raise prices. Analysts at HDFC Securities Ltd note that the delays in the sell-off, owing to its mega-deal size, regulatory approvals, etc. could potentially derail the focus on ACC and Ambuja's planned expansions. ""This would be good news for the industry as a slower pace of capacity addition will reduce the demand-supply imbalance, supporting industry’s pricing power,"" said the domestic brokerage house in a report dated 18 April. That said, since market share loss has been an irritant for shareholders of ACC and Ambuja, the new buyer is expected to go full-throttle on fixing this. ""In the last decade, Holcim India has lost market share and an unlikely leeway under a new promoter. We see an emerging overhang of market disruption and risk of de-rating on leaders – Ultratech Cement and Shree Cement Ltd,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report on 18 April. According to media reports, Holcim is in early-stage negotiations with the Adani and JSW Group for this deal. Meanwhile, Holcim’s exit from its India cement business should be viewed in the backdrop of its strategy to reduce its carbon footprint by 2025. The company aims to cut its cement business to around 35% of revenue in calendar year 2025 from 55% in 2021. Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brazil are among the regions where Holcim has already off-loaded its stake in the cement business.    "
Updated: 23 Mar 2022,Cement price outlook muted for East India,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/cement-price-outlook-muted-for-east-india-11648057381490.html,"Cement companies are seen exiting the March quarter (Q4FY22) with flat prices, despite Q4 being seasonally strong. In the following quarter, Q1FY23, cement makers are expected to raise prices amid steep cost inflation, showed dealers channel checks by various brokerages. Higher realizations would help the sector prevent the erosion of operating margins. However, the eastern region is unlikely to see a meaningful increase in prices as it suffers from an acute demand-supply imbalance. Oversupply in this market against the backdrop of inadequate cement demand growth would weigh on prices, at least in the near term. If demand fails to absorb the supply, the region’s utilization can be expected to stay low. Of the total slated capacity additions of 27.5 million tonnes in FY23, 13.1 million tonnes is scheduled in east India alone, according to estimates of JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd.     "
Updated: 04 Mar 2022,Cement stocks under pressure as price hikes offer little solace,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/cement-stocks-under-pressure-as-price-hikes-offer-little-solace-11646369777074.html,"There is no light at the end of the tunnel for investors in cement stocks, at least for now. Shares of key cement manufacturers Ultratech Cement Ltd, ACC Ltd, Ambuja Cements Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd have dropped 12-8% in the last five trading sessions. This is despite dealers' channel checks indicating that price hikes have been taken in some regions. On a month-on-month basis, cement prices have risen by 4-5% in southern, western and eastern India, according to Jefferies India Pvt Ltd's report dated 3 March. On the other hand, the northern region saw a month-on-month price decline of 2%. Two crucial factors have not played out as per expectations of the Street. In a double whammy, costs are feared to rise futher and uptick in demand has not been as strong as previously anticipated. It should be noted that cement companies use crude-derived petroleum coke (petcoke) and imported coal as key inputs. Prices of these commodities were already elevated, but the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict could add to further upward pressure on supply constraints. ""There has been a substantial increase (up 75%/52%) in South African/Australian coal prices in the last one month (40-50% increase in two weeks),"" domestic brokerage house Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a report on 2 March. At present, imported coal prices are significantly higher than their peak in October 2021. For example, the South African coal price stood around $300/tonne versus its peak of $248/tonne. Petcoke prices too have started to rise, added the report. Analysts caution of peak margin pressures for cement companies in the June quarter of FY23. As far as demand growth is concerned, there is no cheer on that front as well. It should be noted that March quarter is seasonally strong for the sector and has historically seen meaningful uptick in construction activities. However, this time around demand so far in the quarter, has remained muted. ""Demand was weak in Feb'22 like Jan'22 - while dealers attribute to increasing costs of construction materials like steel/sand, companies attribute it to a high base,"" said the Jefferies report. Given the unimpresaive demand scenario, analysts at Jefferies see a risk to their estimate of Rs40 per bag increase in cement prices in Q4FY22. Needless to say, for cement companies the risk of earnings downgrades is getting more pronounced. ""Variable costs are expected to remain elevated in H1CY22 and may pose downside risks to our / consensus FY22-24E earnings in the absence of cumulative Rs45-50/bag price increase during H1CY22,"" analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd said in a report on 2 March."
Updated: 02 Mar 2022,Super 15: Stocks benefitting from rising popularity of ESG theme ,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/super-15-stock-benefitting-from-rising-popularity-of-esg-theme-11646195130371.html,"In a post-Covid world, conscious investing has gained lot of traction among investors. In fact, in 2021, at a global platform, India made a commitment to reach net carbon zero by 2070. With the environment, social and governance (ESG) theme fast catching-up, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd have outlined key considerations for investors and picked stocks from five sectors to bet on this theme. They are as follows: 1) Coal Sector: The fundamental question for India's transition is linked to its coal sector. Ensuring a well-planned and just transition away from coal will be a significant challenge, with both risks and opportunities in the power sector and beyond. With around 8% of state revenue from coal activities, diversification of the economy is needed. Coal India Ltd will be central to the transition. The company has already taken steps to diversify into renewable power, with three gigawatts of planned solar capacity to FY24. Natural gas is also set to play a significant role in displacing coal. GAIL India Ltd operates around 220 mmsmd (million metric standard cubic meter per day) of pipeline capacity and is the largest LNG trader in India. 2) Agriculture accounts for around 20% of India's greenhouse gas emissions and is the main source of non-carbon dioxide related emissions. Opportunities exist for investors through chemical free farming and low-cost solutions which improve irrigation and energy efficiency. UPL Ltd will likely play a central role in decarbonisation efforts. Through various projects, it is driving the adoption of digital solutions and increased penetration of bio-solutions. 3) Road Transport: With auto demand set to grow to 2040, an uptake in electric power-trains is an important area of focus for policy-makers. Tata Motors Ltd leads the local market with nearly 7% market share. Bajaj Auto Ltd, TVS Motor Company Ltd & Hero MotoCorp Ltd are actively expanding their electric vehicles portfolios. 4) Power Utilities: State-run distribution companies will underpin India's energy transition. Their financial fragility however currently inhibits their appetite for investment and transformation of the power grid. NTPC Ltd should be a key beneficiary of new renewable capacity given its access to low cost funding. Power Grid Corporation of India, Larsen & Toubro Ltd, Siemens Ltd and KEI International Ltd could all see tailwinds from increased transmission and distribution spend. 5) Heavy Industry: Heavy industry's share of energy consumption has increased to 42%, making it the largest end user of energy. Incumbents are focused on renewable power with Shree Cement Ltd, The Ramco Cements Ltd and Ultratech Cement Ltd all active in this regard."
Updated: 17 Feb 2022,Why cement stocks are under pressure ahead of Ambuja Cement Q3 results,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/why-cement-stocks-are-under-pressure-ahead-of-ambuja-cement-q3-results-11645082954903.html,"Stock market today: Ahead of Ambuja Cement results for Q3FY22, cement stocks are under selloff heat. UltraTech Cement shares are down near 1 per cent, Shree Cement share are down 0.50 per cent, JK Cement share price is quoting 1.50 per cent lower from its yesterday's close, Ramco Cements shares shed around 1 per cent whereas ACC cement shares are down near half a per cent today. According to stock market experts, cement shares are under pressure ahead of Ambuja Cement results as market is expecting weak Q3 numbers from the cement major. They said that market is trying to adjust with the new EPS (earning per share) and P/E ratio of the cement companies comparing with the P/E ratio and EPS of Ambuja Cement in the wake of weak Q3 results. They went on to add that major reason for weak Q3 results from cement major is rising input cost after surge in coal prices. Speaking on why cement prices are under pressure ahead of Ambuja Cement results for October to December 2021 quarter; Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities said, ""Cement shares are under selloff heat ahead of Ambuja Cement results announcement as market is expecting weak Q3 numbers from the cement major. Market expects that input cost of the cement companies have gone up in recent quarter after the rise in coal prices. So, input cost of the company would lead to rise in margins of the company, even when they manage to keep their revenue on the higher side."" On how weak Ambuja Cement results can impact other cement companies; Ravi Singhal, Vice Chairman at GCL Securities said, ""In the wake of weak Q3 earning of Ambuja Cement, market is adjusting the EPS and P/E ratio of Ambuja Cement shares. After adjusting Ambuja Cement shares P/E ratio and EPS, these indicators of other cement stocks have gone down and this is the reason for other cement stocks being under pressure ahead of Ambuja Cement results for Q3FY22."" Asked about stocks to buy from the cement segment in this falling cement stocks, Ravi Singhal of GCL said that cement companies are expected to report weak results in upcoming quarter as well because the rising coal prices are expected to fuel its input cost in near term. He advised positional investors to look at metal, banking and real estate stocks instead of cement stocks.

Updated: 10 Feb 2022,"Once a laggard, ACC is now fast catching-up with peers",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/once-a-laggard-acc-is-now-fast-catch-up-with-peers-11644480122958.html,"The December quarter earnings of cement maker ACC Ltd were unexciting. Akin to peers Ultratech Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd, ACC's sales volumes fell, while input cost rose. It should be noted that Ambuja Cements Ltd is yet to announce its December quarter earnings. ACC's sales volume was down 3% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 7.49 million tonne. The company follows a January-December accounting year. Ultratech and Shree Cement saw sales volume decline 3% y-o-y and 8.3% y-o-y in Q3FY22. High variable cost continued to hurt, leading to contraction in ACC's operating margin to 13.1% in 4QCY21 from 14.1% in Q3CY21. Hit by a surge in coal prices, power and fuel cost on a per tonne basis rose 27% year-on-year in Q4CY21. In a positive, however, due to its master supply agreement (MSA) with Ambuja, freight cost and raw material costs declined in Q4CY21 compared to Q4CY20. Understandably, ACC shares were muted on Thursday, trading flat on the National Stock Exchange, in reaction to the company's December quarter performance. Nonetheless, the stock’s performance in the last one year has been impressive. ACC shares have risen 31%, outperforming Ultratech’s 17% returns in the same span. Shree Cement stock price has declined 9% in the last one year. In the last five years, ACC shares have given lower returns than Ambuja, Ultratech and Shree. In the the last three years, ACC shares have risen by 66% compared to 110% surge in Ultratech and 80% jump in Ambuja shares. Analysts say the company’s expansion plans are on track and its cost rationalisation measures are yielding results and driving optimism towards the stock. “ACC’s volume improved during CY17-19 after remaining stagnant over CY11-16, which helped to arrest the market share loss seen during CY09-16. Going forward, we expect ACC to benefit from capacity expansions in Central India. Benefits from cost saving strategies (Project Parvat and MSA with Ambuja Cements) are expected to continue going forward,"" analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a report on 10 February. It should be noted that ACC’s 1.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) grinding capacity in Tikaria, Uttar Pradesh and an integrated plant with a clinker and grinding capacity of 2.7mtpa and 1mtpa, respectively in Ametha, Madhya Pradesh are expected to be commissioned by calendar year 2023. Meanwhile, on the valuation front, the ACC stock is trading at a one-year forward (FY23) EV/Ebitda of 9.34 times, showed Bloomberg data. EV is short for enterprise value. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Peers Ultratech and Shree Cement are trading at a higher valuation multiples of 16 times and 18 times, respectively. Analysts say, while the stock price is catching-up, bridging the valuation gap will be a gradual process for ACC."

Cement sales volumes fell by 8.3% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 6.55 million tonnes, impacted by the strike by transporters in markets such as Chhattisgarh. Cost inflation meant standalone earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) per tonne was the lowest in the past few quarters at ₹1,260. Higher sales of traded goods, where the company bought thermal coal globally and sold to its subsidiary in the UAE, also weighed on its costs. So, its total cost per tonne spiked to a multi-quarter high of ₹4,162.    "

The vehicle production could only be around 80% to 85% of the normal production, owing to supply constraint of electronic components due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage situation. Future Retail: Future Retail Ltd’s lenders are planning to discuss allegations of financial irregularities against the retailer and may initiate a forensic audit of the company’s books, two people aware of the development said. In a 24 November letter to the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India, Future Group’s partner Amazon.com Inc. alleged funds diversion in Future Retail, including unfair related-party transactions worth about $1 billion; a sudden spike in Future Retail’s debts; and an inordinate delay in payment to creditors due to discrimination by promoters. NTPC: State-owned power giant NTPC said 250-MW unit-4 of its Nabinagar power plant will begin commercial from the midnight of Wednesday. ""Unit-4 of 250 MW capacity of Nabinagar Thermal Power Project (4X250 MW) of Bhartiya Rail Bijlee Company Limited (a subsidiary company of NTPC Ltd) is declared on commercial operation w.e.f. 00:00 hrs of December 1, 2021,"" according to a BSE filing. With this, the commercial capacity of the NTPC group will become 67,907.5 megawatts (MW), it stated. Coal India: State-run Coal India Ltd (CIL) plans to invest ₹19,650 crore by FY24 to increase coal transportation capacity by 330 million tonnes (mt) by constructing rail links and setting up joint ventures (JVs). The world’s largest coal miner’s rail mobility play comes against the backdrop of a coal shortage that has raised concerns. The situation has however improved with fuel stock sufficient for nine days at 136 coal-run power projects totalling 166.109 giga watt (GW). Shares of Coal India surged in Tuesday's opening deals after the miner in a regulatory filing on Monday said that the board in its meeting held approved payment of interim dividend for FY22 at ₹9 per share of the face value of ₹10 as against ₹7.5 per share announced last year. Rail Vikas Nigam: The company signed MoU with Economic Policy Research Institute of KYRGYZ Republic, Government of Kyrgyzstan, for development of railway corridor projects in Kyrgyz Republic specially to connect from Bishkek to Karakechenskoye. NMDC: State-owned mining company NMDC on Tuesday slashed prices of lump ore by ₹750 a tonne and fines ₹200 per tonne, with immediate effect. In a regulatory filing, the company said it has revised the rates of lump ore or higher grade ore to ₹5,200 a tonne. While the price of lump ore or low-grade ore has been fixed at ₹4,560 per tonne. Yes Bank: The Supreme Court on Tuesday set aside a Noida police directive that barred Yes Bank Ltd from exercising its rights over the shares it owns in Dish TV India Ltd and stayed the ongoing police probe, saying such actions can have “dangerous consequences"". The top court’s order allows Yes Bank, the satellite-TV provider’s largest shareholder with a 25.63% stake, to continue its now over-two month battle for a board reconstitution at Dish TV. Torrent Pharma: Shares of Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd have gained more than 10% over the last one week. The renewed investor confidence is led by expectations of a strong growth trajectory in the domestic market, which have prompted analysts at Credit Suisse to upgrade the stock to “outperform"" from “underperform"". The company had reported lower-than-expected performance for September quarter. Axis Bank: Private lender Axis Bank has received approval from both Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and Nation Stock Exchange (NSE) to reclassify four insurers from promoter category to public shareholders. ""We wish to inform you that BSE and NSE vide their respective letters dated November 30, 2021 have granted their approval for the reclassification of aforementioned promoters to “Public"" category from “Promoter"" category,"" Axis Bank said in a filing.

Zomato said it would facilitate fundraising for its partner restaurants by helping them position their story and metrics and connecting them with investors. Zomato itself, though, will not invest in the restaurant brands."
Updated: 01 Nov 2021,The race for ‘most valued listed Indian cement stock’ gets intense,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/the-race-for-most-valued-listed-indian-cement-stock-gets-intense-11635750150961.html,"The valuation gap between Shree Cement Ltd and UltraTech Cement Ltd has continued to narrow. With that, the race for India’s most expensive listed Indian cement stock is getting exciting. At a one-year forward EV/Ebitda of around 20 times, Shree Cement has managed to maintain the top spot, at least for now. EV is short for enterprise value. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.  UltraTech Cement is trading at a valuation multiple of around 17 times, shows Bloomberg data.  But with September quarter earnings a mixed bag and competitor UltraTech's slew of cost-rationalisation measures, Shree Cement’s tag of most valued listed Indian cement stock is at a greater risk. In the September quarter, Shree Cement’s volumes declined 3.3% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 6.32 million tonne given its higher exposure to eastern India, which is facing a situation of over-supply. On the volume growth front, peers have performed better in the September quarter. Analysts note that Shree Cement’s volumes are lower than industry average, suggesting a marginal reduction in market share for the company. However, a miss on volume was offset by higher blended realisation. Also, a one-time push to operating profit came from that sale of power in the spot market, which contained the decline in Ebitda to 11% y-o-y. Analysts note that Shree Cement maintained a meaningful differential in Ebitda margins over its peers (Ambuja and UltraTech) on back of higher share of cheaper renewable power, indirect tax incentives and logistics advantage.  ""But the gap has contracted significantly over the last one year due to optimisation of realisations and extensive work on rationalisation of freight cost done by the peers. We believe that gap would further narrow down with a multi-fold increase in share of renewable power and further reduction in lead distance coupled with commissioning of new plants,"" analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd said in a report. Apart from its cost leadership, Shree Cement’s net cash position is also among the key factors supporting its premium valuations. But even there, Ultratech is fast catching-up; it is on a debt-reduction spree and continues to strengthen its balance sheet. UltraTech’s net debt increased by 6% sequentially, but declined 47% y-o-y to ₹6,300 crore as of September 2021. Net debt/Ebitda remained stable at 0.5times as of 2QFY22 from 1.3 times in 2QFY21.  ""With strong operational cash flows, we estimate 4-6% free cash flow yield in FY2021-24E despite growth capex and to help Ultratech become net cash positive in FY2022E,"" said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. And these factors have started to reflect in their valuations. Analysts at IDBI Capital Pvt Ltd highlight that Shree Cement’s valuation premium to UltraTech is at 45% compared to the highs at 80% and historical average of 40%. Meanwhile, Shree Cement has guided to increase its capacity to 80mtpa from 46.4mtpa by 2030. Mtpa is short for million tonnes per annum. Investors should note that, contrary to its earlier policy of focusing on organic expansion, Shree Cement is actively exploring inorganic opportunities to meet the targeted capacity. On the other hand, in the case of UltraTech, analysts at Kotak point out that the company in the past added leverage for inorganic growth, but given that there is no major cement asset on the block, merger & acquisition is not a likely risk."
Updated: 15 Sep 2021,Shree Cement stock gains 2% as board approves expansion plans,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/shree-cement-stock-gains-2-after-board-approves-expansion-plans-11631680045703.html,"Shares of Shree Cement Ltd are in focus on Wednesday after its board approved a slew of expansion plans. The company will increase its clinker capacity by 3.8 million tonne (mt) and cement grinding capacity by 6.5mt. Reacting to this, the stock rose around 2% on the NSE in Wednesday's opening trade. The board also approved a proposal to set up 106megawatt solar capacity at a total capex of Rs4800 crore. This is likely to be commissioned by March 2024. Post this expansion, its domestic grinding capacity would rise from 43.4mt to 53 mt. Investors would reckon that the company aims to achieve 80 mt capacity by FY30 and this expansion is a step towards that. ""Our current forecasts imply a 9% capacity CAGR over FY21-26E and 6.5% thereafter,"" analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd said in a report on 15 September. CAGR is short for compounded annual growth rate. Furthermore, the company has proposed to set up an integrated cement plant in Rajasthan with clinker and cement capacity of 3.8mt and 3.5mt, respectively. This would be done at a capital expenditure of Rs3500 crore and would be funded through a mix of internal accruals and debt. This plant is expected to be commissioned by March 2024. Shree Cement would also set up a 106 megawatt solar power plant. Analysts say this expansion will help the company enhance the proportion of clean energy usage in total energy consumption, reduce fossil fuel use and help reduce its carbon footprint.  It should be noted that Shree Cement has increased renewable power generation capacity by 10MW year-on-year to 244MW, with the share of green power up by 300 basis points (bps) year-on-year to 48% in FY21. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. ""We build in consolidated volume and Ebitda CAGRs of 12% and 14%, respectively, over FY21-24E,"" added the Emkay report."

Updated: 11 Aug 2021,Shree Cement tanks on poor operating performance in the June quarter,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/shree-cement-tanks-on-poor-operating-performance-in-the-june-quarter-11628657619223.html,"Shares of Shree Cement fell over 4% on the BSE yesterday, a day after the company reported its June quarter earnings. The cement major posted a net profit of ₹6.6 bn in the June quarter, a rise of 78.5% from ₹3.7 bn in the year-ago quarter. However, the net profit was 13.8% lower than ₹7.7 bn in the quarter ended March 2021. Its quarterly profit fell as power and fuel costs rose. Still, the earnings beat estimates. Company's performance on operational front Shree Cement's revenue increased 47.9% to ₹34.5 bn from ₹23.3 bn, year on year (YoY), but declined on a sequential basis from ₹39.6 bn. EBITDA stood at ₹11.5 bn in June 2021 up 39.7% from ₹8.3 bn in the same quarter a year ago. Market experts believe that even though the company's results were mostly in line with estimates, the street had expected a beat after its peers like UltraTech Cement, Ambuja Cement, and ACC delivered a 10% to 15% beat on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA). June quarter earnings of Shree Cement were a mixed bag. While realisations were better-than-expected, increased operating cost was a dampener, offsetting benefits of improved realisations. Also, its volume growth on YoY basis was weighed by lower clinker sales. Cement volumes grew 41% YoY to 6.8 m tonnes (MT), while clinker sales, down 62% YoY, pulled down overall volume growth to 39% YoY to 6.8 MT. Shree Cement lagged behind peers in terms of volume growth in the June quarter, with UltraTech Cement, Ambuja Cement, and ACC delivering 47%, 53%, and 44%, respectively. Global brokerage firm cuts target Global brokerage CLSA maintained an 'underperform' rating on the stock and cut the target price on expensive valuation. Shree Cement’s quarter one EBITDA of ₹10.1 bn, down 18% quarter on quarter (QoQ) was in line with CLSA's estimates. Volume declined 17% QoQ and was slightly better than pan-India peers. Shree Cement aims to achieve 80 MT capacity by 2030 (7% CAGR) from 43 MT in March 2021, indicating that its goal of doubling the capacity in five-seven years is progressing at a slower pace than its earlier guidance. With the net cash of ₹64 bn and cumulative EBITDA of ₹155 bn over the next three years, the use of cash will be a key focus, CLSA said. Meanwhile, brokerage firm Nomura believes the company's margins are likely to compress in the next two quarters owing to weaker prices and higher input costs. Equitymaster's technical view on the cement sector We reached out to Brijesh Bhatia, Research Analyst at Equitymaster, and editor of the premium monthly recommendation service Fast Profits Report, for his technical view on the cement sector. Here's what he has to say... The financial market was hit in March 2020 by lockdown and by March 2021, they are up by 100% from the lows. Cement sector outperformed and most of the cement stocks are up by 100% from the lows. The demand in cement is largely lead by government spending on infrastructure and real estate. The commercial office been vacant with work-from-home culture and new housing projects been stalled, can still the cement sector rally from current levels? We created an Equal Weighted Cement Index (EWCI) chart using cements stocks with market cap over 10,000 crores and compared it with Nifty Realty Index. Since the lows in March 2020, EWCI and realty index rallied in a same manner. But since March 2021, we are witnessing divergence between the two sectors (marked red) where cement stocks are trading near high and realty stocks are underperforming against cement stocks. To check the future outperformance of cement stocks, we compared EWCI with Nifty. The ratio chart of EWCI Index vs Nifty above is indicating profit bookings can be on cards for cement stocks and it has reversed from the similar highs made in June 2020. The negative crossover of averages on Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) supports an underperformance of EWCI over Nifty. How the stock markets reacted to Shree Cement’s results Shares of Shree Cement opened the day at ₹28,427.6 on the BSE yesterday and ₹28,195 on the NSE.

Its shares fell more than 4% on the NSE on Tuesday; it was the top loser among Nifty50 stocks. And why not! For a stock trading at a premium valuation multiple, lagging peers on crucial operating parameters is unlikely to be tolerated by investors. A key disappointment came from its rising input costs, which offset better-than-anticipated growth in realizations. Consequently, its Ebitda/tonne at ₹1,481 was below the estimated range of ₹1,551-1,553. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.         "

Asian shares wobbled on Monday amid sharp losses in gold and oil prices, while the dollar held near four-month highs after an upbeat US jobs report lifted bond yields. Sentiment was shaken by a sudden dive in gold as a break of $1,750 triggered stop loss sales taking it as low as $1,684 an ounce . It was last down 2.2% at $1,723. Brent sank almost 2% on concerns the spread of the Delta variant would temper travel demand. Holidays in Tokyo and Singapore made for thin trading conditions, leaving MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.1%. Japan's Nikkei was shut but futures were trading just below Friday's close. Nasdaq futures slipped 0.5% and S&P 500 futures 0.3%.

Investors were still assessing whether Friday's strong US payrolls report would take the Federal Reserve a step nearer to winding back its stimulus. However, the pace of tapering was still up in the air and would decide when an actual rate hike came, he said. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion of assets a month, so a $20 billion taper would end the programme in six months whilst a $10 billion tapering approach would take a year. The spread of the Delta variant could argue for a longer taper with US cases back to levels seen in last winter's surge with more than 66,000 people hospitalised.

Updated: 20 Jul 2021,ACC’s valuations to get a boost from June-quarter earnings,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/acc-stock-up-6-on-stellar-operating-performance-in-june-quarter-11626755320072.html,"Cement major ACC Ltd reported a stellar operating performance in the June quarter, sending its stock 7% higher on Tuesday. Higher-than-expected realizations and tight cost-control measures were among the key positive takeaways for investors in this stock. Average realization per tonne rose around 7.5% on a sequential basis, beating expectations of around 5% growth. The outperformance on the realizations front was aided by high cement prices in ACC’s key markets of north and central India, higher sale of premium products and lower discount. Favourable fuel mix, efficient logistics and various cost-efficiency measures under project Parvat helped contain a steep increase in operating costs.  Consequently, ACC’s Ebitda of ₹875 crore for Q2CY21 exceeded Bloomberg’s analysts’ consensus estimate of ₹720 crore. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. ACC follows the calendar year as its financial year. On a per-tonne basis, Ebitda was at around ₹1,280 per tonne, which according to analysts, is the highest in a decade. Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said ACC’s Ebitda on a two-year CAGR basis was up 6%. CAGR stands for compounded annual growth rate. As far as volumes are concerned, it grew by 43% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 6.84 million tonnes aided by a favourable base. However, it fell around 14% sequentially. Analysts said the sequential fall in volumes despite the second wave of covid and a lean season is lower than feared earlier. The robust earnings performance in a seasonally weak quarter bodes well for its valuations. The ACC stock is trading at a one-year forward EV/Ebitda of around 10 times. EV stands for enterprise value. Peers Shree Cements Ltd and UltraTech Cement Ltd are trading at a valuation multiple of 16 times and 13 times, respectively, shows Bloomberg data. “ACC’s valuation gap versus peers has widened by around 25% in the last three-four months, and the Q2 beat should help close some of the gap,"" said analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. ACC has been a laggard among other pan-India cement makers given its capacity constraints. The firm has commenced the capacity expansion project at its Ametha unit in Madhya Pradesh. Its waste heat recovery projects at Jamul and Kymore are on track and are likely to be commissioned by Q2CY22. Analysts are hopeful that the overhang of capacity constraints will soon be behind the company."
Updated: 09 Jul 2021,Cement stocks gain on hopes of demand recovery,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/cement-stocks-gain-on-hopes-of-demand-recovery-11625770632684.html,"Cement stocks are racing ahead of stock market benchmarks, as investors bet that easing lockdowns, post-monsoon construction and the government’s infrastructure push will boost volumes and prices in the coming quarters. Since 1 June, shares of Andhra Cements, Shiva Cement, JK Lakshmi Cement, Shree Digvijay Cement, Dalmia Bharat, The Ramco Cements, Ambuja Cements, India Cement and JK Cement have gained between 5% and 95%. In the same period, benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty managed to clock gains of just 1.8% and 1.5%, respectively. “Despite the negativity inflicted by the second wave of covid-19, sentiments remained positive. We expect the government to continue its spending spree on infrastructure development and mega affordable housing schemes to support the economy and enhance job creation. Housing demand remained resilient across the markets. We remain confident on sustainability of margins as we believe that the sector has ample pricing power to mitigate increase in input costs"", broking firm Prabhudas Lilladher said in a report to its investors. According to Reliance Securities, all-India cement demand held up well in May, with a decline of 13% from April. Year-on-year, it is expected to have grown by 4% on a negative base of 10%. Most importantly, activity picked up strongly in June as volumes are estimated to have increased by 17% from April (and 6% from a year ago), the report added. “Among regions, North is expected to outperform with 25% growth month-on-month (MoM) on a flattish base. Volumes in the central region are expected to grow at 12% on a flat base. Though growth in east/south would look optically better at 20%/10% MoM, it came on a weak base of 25%/25% decline. Western region’s demand is expected to grow at 10% MoM on a negative base of 9%."" The brokerage added that all-India average price is expected to have improved by strong 5.2% quarter-on-quarter (up 1.5% year-on-year) in first quarter of FY22E, mainly aided by sharp improvement in Southern region (up 9.9% QoQ), Eastern (up 7.4% QoQ) and Western (up 5.8% QoQ). This was despite the second covid wave and localized lockdowns. However, analysts at broking firm Nirmal Bang cautioned that further further price hikes are unlikely, primarily due to seasonality and also due to pressure from various customers who are opposing price hikes."
Updated: 24 May 2021,Shree Cement falls 3% as earnings lag behind peers,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/shree-cement-falls-3-as-earnings-lag-behind-peers-11621842275256.html,"Mumbai: Shares of Shree Cements declined as much as 3% on Monday even as the cement maker reported a 49% jump in consolidated net profit to ₹799.79 crore in the March quarter. Analysts said the company's performance has lagged behind peers on several fronts. At 01:06 pm, Shree Cement stock was at ₹26,936.55, down 2.44% from its previous close, while the benchmark index, Sensex gained 0.32% to 50700.74. The shares have underperformed those of UltraTech Cement Ltd by a huge margin in the past year. “Shree Cement’s Q4FY21 Ebitda failed to measure up on the surprise quotient displayed by the majority of industry peers. Reported Ebitda stood more than 5% ahead of our estimate, whereas the beat was by 20-30% for other large peers,"" analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a report on 21 May. Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) increased by 17.13% to ₹1,237.78 crore, but margin dropped 151 bps to 29.44% compared to the year-ago quarter due to wage increments and higher freight and forwarding expenses. Analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services in a note to clients said volume growth at 19% was weighed by lower clinker sales than peers. ""Shree lags behind peers in terms of volume growth, with UltraTech/ Ambuja/Dalmia delivering 30%/ 24%/ 24%. The management had raised equity through qualified institutional placement (QIP) at end calendar year 2019 to double capacity to 80mtpa by fiscal 2027. However, the execution has been slower than anticipated, with only one expansion (of 4mpta in East) having been announced to date. Coupled with low dividends (only 11% payout), expect this to result in an increase in cash piles to ₹13,400 crore in FY23 from ₹8500 crore in FY21 will keep return on equity (RoE) subdued"". ""Shree is trading at 16 times FY23E Enterprise Value/EBITDA and add the value of its UAE operations ($70/t) and expect EBITDA to grow at a 15% CAGR over FY21–23 estimates, in line with other large-cap peers, on a 12% CAGR for cement sales volumes."" The brokerage has a 'neutral' rating to the stock. Finance cost in March quarter dropped 23.81% to ₹56.28 crore, while depreciation & amortisation expenses declined 28.94% to ₹330.21, and power & fuel cost advanced 0.64% to ₹702.58 crore compared to the corresponding quarter of last fiscal. Freight & forwarding expenses jumped 33.47% to ₹969.05 crore compared to the year-ago quarter. Analysts at Emkay Global Financial though said Shree Cement offers the best long-term growth prospects with market share gain and robust return on invested captal (RoIC), driven by cost leadership in terms of both capex/ton and opex/ton. ""It may generate Free cash flow(FCF) of ₹5100 crore after factoring in capex of Rs3700 crore over FY22estimates-23 estimates as it enjoys industry-leading RoIC of 30% in FY21, which is expected to further expand by 900bps to 39% by FY23E, driven by rising asset turnover and margins,"" it said. The brokerage maintained FY22-23 estimates and a 'buy' rating on the stock, implying 19 times one-year forward enterprise value by equity, and ""the stock’s premium valuation at current 19.2 times EV/E already reflects our strong outlook, hence expect the stock’s returns to be driven essentially by earnings compounding""."
Updated: 23 May 2021,Shree Cement’s performance lags behind UltraTech in March quarter,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/shree-cement-s-performance-lags-behind-ultratech-in-march-quarter-11621793871178.html,"Shares of Shree Cement Ltd have underperformed those of UltraTech Cement Ltd by a huge margin in the past year. The former’s March quarter earnings have also lagged the latter. “Shree Cement’s Q4FY21 Ebitda failed to measure up on the surprise quotient displayed by the majority of industry peers. Reported Ebitda stood more than 5% ahead of our estimate, whereas the beat was by 20-30% for other large peers,"" analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a report on 21 May. Shree Cement also lacked the surprise punch, not just for the March quarter, Edelweiss analysts pointed out. Its FY21 operating performance was also slightly underwhelming. The company’s Ebitda/tonne stood flat year-on-year (y-o-y), whereas most cement makers reported growth, the analysts said.  The underperformance of the shares seems understandable against that backdrop. Besides, there has been a huge reduction in leverage in FY21 in the case of UltraTech, causing a re-rating in the stock as well. Shree Cement’s operating margin was impacted by a jump in costs. On a standalone basis, margins fell 358 basis points (bps) y-o-y to 30% in Q4FY21. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. On a sequential basis, operating margin declined almost 300bps. Costs of raw materials consumed saw a moderate increase and freight costs jumped 34% y-o-y on higher diesel prices. Raw material costs for the sector were impacted by a rise in fly-ash and slag prices and higher inbound logistics costs. However, peers have a better grip on costs. Despite the cost pressure, UltraTech, ACC Ltd and Ambuja Cements Ltd saw their margins expand in Q4FY21. As such, Shree Cement’s operating performance comes as a disappointment for its investors, analysts said. Most cement makers have tried to offset the impact of a rise in petroleum coke prices by fuel mix optimization and other cost control measures. However, Shree Cement’s employee cost and other expenses rose by 44% and 35% y-o-y respectively in the March quarter. Other expenses were higher because of an increase in advertising spends and repair and maintenance expenses, the company said. A rise in employee costs can be partly attributed to salary increments and could be a one-off, analysts said. Shree Cement’s average realization/tonne for the March quarter was ₹200-250/tonne higher than consensus estimates, analysts said, but that gain was offset by elevated operating costs. Among other positives, total sales volumes grew 19% y-o-y with cement volumes at 8.2 million tonnes in Q4FY21, beating analysts’ estimate of 7.5-7.7 million tonnes. Akin to peers, a favourable base aided volume growth. Its FY21 volume growth of 7.7% at 26.8 million tonnes is among the best in the industry, analysts said. Lower depreciation and interest cost resulted in standalone net profit growth of 30.5% y-o-y to ₹767 crore, beating Bloomberg’s consensus estimate of ₹690 crore. Meanwhile, the stock is trading at a one-year forward EV/Ebitda of 19 times, according to Bloomberg data. EV is short for enterprise value. Shree Cement is still the most expensive listed Indian cement stock, followed by UltraTech, which is trading at a valuation multiple of 16 times. A steep margin contraction could weigh on the stock’s near-term sentiments, but analysts said Shree Cement’s strong cash flow position is likely to keep its valuation multiple higher than competitors. In FY21, the company’s net cash improved to ₹6,520 crore from ₹3,320 crore in the previous financial year."

The bank will declare its Q4 FY21 and full year results on Friday. Axis Bank: The government has raised about ₹4,000 crore from sale of 1.95% stake in the bank held through SUUTI. ""The OFS of Axis Bank got good response from investors with SUUTI garnering about ₹4,000 cr (subject to reconciliation). Thanks to all for their participation,"" DIPAM Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey tweeted. Sterling and Wilson Solar: Sebi is investigating suspected financial irregularities at the Shapoorji Pallonji Group company, two people aware of the matter told Mint. The probe follows allegations by a few SW Solar shareholders last year that Shapoorji Pallonji and Co. Pvt. Ltd may have utilized funds raised in SW Solar’s August 2019 public share sale for purposes other than those mentioned in its share sale documents. ICICI Bank: The private sector lender’s cardholder base grew by a record 672,911 during the March quarter, while HDFC Bank’s portfolio contracted by 322,999 in the same period, latest data released by the central bank showed. SBI Card and Axis Bank added 331,523 and 273,310 cards, respectively. Jaypee Infratech: Creditors' panel of the bankrupt-company decided to start the voting process on Suraksha group's offer from next week and rejected the plan proposed by state-owned NBCC, sources told PTI. NBCC's bid was reportedly found to be non-compliant with certain provisions of the insolvency law. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation: The state-owned oil retailer's March quarter net profit soared many folds to ₹3,018 crore on the back of inventory gains and rise in refining margins. The company also reported its highest ever profit after tax of ₹10,664 crore during financial year 2020-2021. Havells India: The consumer electrical goods maker reported 70.95% rise in consolidated net profit at ₹303.83 crore for the quarter ended March.

Updated: 21 Apr 2021,"Low base aids ACC volumes in Q1, but covid may delay expansions",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/for-acc-low-base-aids-volumes-but-second-wave-could-delay-crucial-expansions-11618891573793.html,"In the March quarter, cement sales volumes of ACC Ltd grew 21% on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis to 8 million tonnes. This is marginally ahead of the 20% y-o-y growth that analysts were anticipating. On a sequential basis, volumes grew 4%. The growth was largely aided by a low base of last year. Also, ACC’s recently commissioned 1.4 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) Sindri grinding unit in Jharkhand aided volumes to an extent. For a company that is struggling with capacity constraints, such robust growth is impressive.   ACC’s management has stuck to its guidance of commissioning the remaining 4.8mtpa grinding unit and 2.7mtpa clinker plant in central India in Q2CY22. ACC follows the calendar year as its financial year. However, analysts cautioned of some delay given the restrictions put in place by the government against the backdrop of rising covid cases. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities see a risk of three to six months delay and expect the commissioning at the end of calendar year 2022. Foreign research house CLSA was of the view that with capacity utilization at 90%, ACC is likely to grow slower than the industry till its Ametha unit in Madhya Pradesh is ramped up. “We believe its two-year volume CAGR of 3% was lower than the industry (+7%). In the current cycle of strong demand growth, the outlook of companies with strong volume growth are better placed,"" it said in a report. CAGR is short for compounded annual growth rate. CLSA cautions that ACC will struggle to maintain market share. Another highlight of ACC’s March quarter earnings was its operating performance. Ebitda at ₹860 crore was the highest ever in a quarter, and 20% above consensus estimates. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. The beat was driven by lower variable costs and better-than-expected realizations due to a higher share of premium products. Operating margins for the quarter stood at 20.4%, a y-o-y increase of more than 300 basis points. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. That said, the increase in prices of key input materials, such as petroleum coke, coal, power and fuel and freight costs, could weigh on margins, going ahead. To be sure, recent channel checks by various brokerages show that cement prices across India increased by about ₹15 for a 50kg bag in April. So, that may help contain margin compression to some extent. Meanwhile, Bloomberg data showed that shares of ACC were trading at a one-year forward EV/Ebitda of around 8 times, a steep discount to pan-India focused peers, trading at multiples of 18-20 times. EV is short for enterprise value. Analysts said despite the earnings beat, ACC’s valuation gap with peers is unlikely to significantly narrow until new capacity is commissioned."

The company said the loan repayments have been done through free cash flows that it has generated over the last few quarters despite the challenging circumstances and severe business interruptions during the first quarter of the current fiscal. It should be noted that this is in-line with the company's target of becoming net debt-free by fiscal 2023. After Tuesday's announcement, the company's gross debt at the end of fiscal 2021 is likely to be around ₹18000 crore. The company's net debt as of December quarter stood at ₹9400 crore, a steep decline from ₹16900 crore in FY20 end. Analysts at Antique Stock Broking Ltd point out that the company's peak net debt/Ebitda post the acquisitions stood at near three times in FY19, ""which has fallen to 0.8times in 9mFY21"". Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. ""Such aggressive debt reduction on the back of improving operating profitability has led to sharp improvement in return ratios. ROCE/ROE are expected to reach mid-teens in FY22-23 after remaining sub-par for prolonged period for Ultratech,"" the domestic broking house said in a report on 31 March. ROCE is short for return on capital employed. ROE stands for return on equity. Meanwhile, shares of the companare trading at a one-year forward EV/Ebitda multiple of 15 times. EV stands for enterprise value. Ultratech is the second most expensive cement stock on this parameter, first being debt-free Shree Cement Ltd, which is trading at a multiple of around 21 times. Analysts expect the valuation gap between the two companies to narrow as Ultratech inches closer to achieving a debt-free status."

Not just demand, it also sees long-term margins holding up despite a dip in FY22. In-line with its upbeat view on the sector, it has raised FY23 earnings estimates for the sector up to 13%. For now, there are risks to margin growth and eventually earnings, which investors should not overlook. Hit hard by cost inflation, cement makers took a much-needed hike of around Rs50/bag in March, according to dealer channel checks by various brokerages. One cement bag weighs 50 kilograms. On an average, one cement bag now costs Rs360 at an all-India level. Also Read | Australia’s prime time battle against big tech Reacting to the brokerage firm's upbeat outlook, shares of top cement makers such as Ultratech Cement Ltd, Shree Cement Ltd and Ambuja Cement Ltd rose around 1.5% each on the National Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Analysts and managements of key cement makers see more upside to prices of petroleum coke, which have risenmore than 70% on a year-on-year basis. Petroleum coke is a key input required to make cement and is derived from crude oil. Operating margins may also come under pressure due to rising freight charges as diesel prices have remained northbound. Domestic brokerage house JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd estimates the sector's power cost to increase by Rs81/tonne and freight cost by Rs36/tonne on a sequential basis."

In the December quarter, ACC’s volumes fell 0.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 7.7 million tonnes. This shows significant underperformance to the industry’s estimated growth rate of 7%. UltraTech Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd posted double-digit volume growth of 14% and 15%, on a y-o-y basis respectively, in the December quarter. ACC has hit a capacity constraint, which has led to the poor volume growth. In a post-earnings conference call, the management said capacity utilization is around 85%. As such, ACC is expanding capacities in east and central India.

Also, clinker capacity of 3mtpa at Ametha, Madhya Pradesh, would be commissioned in June 2022. Further, its waste heat recovery system at Jamul and Kymore in Madhya Pradesh are slated to be commissioned in 12 months. The management said that it aims to add a total of 6.2mtpa cement capacity in 2022. In short, the overhang of capacity constraint is short-term in nature. Still, analysts see ACC reaping the benefits of these expansions only after calendar year 2022. Until then, a further market share loss for the company is feared. “With the spectre of the Competition Commission of India hanging on the head of the sector, cement prices won’t improve meaningfully in a hurry. So, the focus of investors would shift from realisations growth to volumes. The spree of capacity expansions announced by ACC’s competitors indicates that the chase for volume growth would get more aggressive. These capacities have to meet their scheduled deadline, otherwise market share loss would further widen the valuation gap between ACC and peers,"" an analyst with a domestic brokerage firm said, requesting anonymity. On the valuation front, the ACC stock is trading a discount to peers. Bloomberg data shows that ACC is trading at an EV/Ebitda of 12 times. EV stands for enterprise value. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. On an EV/Ebitda basis, Shree Cement and UltraTech are trading at multiples of 25 times and 18 times, respectively."

Volume growth of 15% year-on-year (y-o-y) was ahead of the Street’s estimated 11-12% growth range. Although Shree’s earnings were better than estimates, close competitor UltraTech Cement Ltd also posted impressive earnings. UltraTech’s volumes grew 14% y-o-y in Q3FY21. But a key highlight of the latter’s earnings announcement was its target to become net debt-free by FY23. UltraTech’s sharpened focus on debt repayment has, among other things, helped its stock bridge the gap with Shree, which is the most expensive cement stock. In the past two months, UltraTech shares have risen around 24%, compared to a mere 4% rise in shares of Shree Cement. Also Read | The Finance Commission doesn’t rock the federal boat Analysts at domestic brokerage IDBI Capital Ltd said Shree’s valuation premium to UltraTech has narrowed to 54%, compared to the highs of 80% seen in the past.  Shree’s cost leadership, timely capacity additions and debt-free status have contributed to its rich valuation multiple. Second, a key catalyst for the Shree Cement stock has been its massive expansion plan. But the recent delay in the commissioning of some units has got analysts a bit worried. “While the management has guided it will double capacity to 80 mtpa by FY27, execution has been slower than anticipated, with only one expansion (of 4 mtpa) having been announced in the east. Therefore, we expect the cash pile to grow further, diluting RoE by 200 bps to 15% over FY21-23E,"" analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a report on 1 February. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. RoE is return on equity. In a post-earnings call, the Shree Cement management said its grinding units in Maharashtra and Odisha are expected to be commissioned in Q4 FY21 versus December 2020 guided earlier. Many cement companies, including UltraTech, announced expansions in the east. Although demand in the region is recovering, analysts said it is going to be a fight for market share at the expense of margins. Further, the ongoing probes by the Competition Commission of India will keep cement makers from taking steep hikes despite cost pressures. In this backdrop, analysts are uncomfortable with Shree’s valuations. “We remain cautious on near-term cement prices given the regulatory overhang. Moreover, costs are most likely to rise for power, fuel and freight. We believe Shree’s sector-leading returns are fairly factored into its valuation. While the valuation differential to peers is partly bridged, at a 17.5 times FY22 EV-Ebitda, it still looks demanding despite higher returns,"" foreign research house CLSA said in a report on 1 February.

A key highlight of the September quarter for cement manufacturers was their impressive volume growth. The top 15 companies, which have a 75% volume market share, witnessed a 5% year-on-year demand increase in 2QFY21, added the Kotak report published on 19 November. Sales were largely aided by pent-up rural demand ahead of the festive season. Some pick-up in infrastructure and allied-activities also contributed to volume growth in certain markets. Region-wise, North, Central and East reported better growth in volumes than West and South. Further, the commentary on demand outlook by most cement companies was positive. So, companies have reinstated their capital expenditure plans, which were put on hold due to the pandemic. “Given the positive surprise on volume in 2Q and sustained momentum in October 20, managements have upped their volume guidance (flattish growth vs. 10-20% decline expected earlier) for FY21. Growth capex is gradually picking up pace on increasing comfort and visibility on volume growth,"" analysts at JM Financial Institutional Equities Ltd said in a report on 18 November. Among the large players, Ultratech Cement Ltd has guided for a capex of Rs1200-1300 crore for FY21. The company spent ₹450 crore of capex in the first half of FY21. The management of Shree Cement Ltd told analysts that it has restarted growth capex given the demand momentum. With capex focussed on expansion, the management expects its capacity to increase up to 57 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) in three years and up to 80MTPA in six-seven years time. ACC Ltd said it is now going ahead with the 1.1MTPA of grinding expansion in Sindri. Dalmia Bharat Ltd would entail ₹400 crore for capacity expansion at the Murli Industries unit and other initiatives will entail ₹500 crore of capex, the management said. Regional cement makers such as JK Cement Ltd, Orient Cement Ltd and Heidelberg Cement Ltd have also resumed their capex plans. While recovery in demand is sentimentally positive for cement stocks, there are downside risks to profitability growth from rising input costs. Analysts say, although the sector’s top-line will show improvement in quarters to come, operating margins could take a hit in absence of price hikes."
Updated: 12 Nov 2020,Shree Cement’s valuations get a leg up from decent earnings,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/shree-cement-s-premium-valuation-gets-support-from-its-decent-q2-earnings-11605156990270.html,"The Shree Cement Ltd stock rose nearly 3% on Thursday on NSE, reacting to its September-quarter earnings. The cement major’s volumes grew 14% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 6.5 million tonnes in Q2. In a post-earnings conference call, the management said the demand momentum seen in September sustained in October. It expects near-term demand to remain strong, and foresees a 7-8% volume growth in FY21. The cement sector has surprised the Street with stellar volume growth in Q2, aided by pent-up demand from smaller cities and towns. Peers UltraTech Cement Ltd and Ambuja Cements Ltd saw their volumes grow in mid-single digits in the September quarter. For ACC Ltd, volume growth was flattish in the quarter gone by. Analysts say Shree Cement’s continued focus on capacity expansion has given it an edge over peers on volume growth in the recent past. But apart from that, what provided more comfort to investors is an improved handle on operating cost. In the June quarter, Shree Cement lagged competitors in controlling operating costs, which was a key disappointment for the Street. An analysis by domestic brokerage house Reliance Securities Ltd shows that Shree Cement is leading the pack on this metric in Q2. Its operating cost/tonne stood at ₹3,046 last quarter, lower than Ambuja’s measure of ₹3,831, UltraTech’s ₹3,818 and ACC’s ₹4,417. The management said freight costs declined sequentially, and input costs fell. Further, the management expects the per tonne cost run rate will remain in a similar range going forward. Analysts attribute this as one factor that supports its premium valuation to peers. The Shree Cement stock trades at a one-year forward EV/Ebitda of 20 times—the highest among listed Indian cement companies. EV stands for enterprise value. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. UltraTech and ACC are trading at much lower multiples of around 15 times and 11 times, respectively. Meanwhile, improved prices in the company’s key market of North along with higher share of premium products aided realizations growth. However, it remains to be seen if prices sustain at higher levels in the North given the intensifying competition."
Updated: 21 Oct 2020,UltraTech’s valuation gap with Shree Cement may narrow post earnings,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/ultratech-cement-beats-acc-hands-down-on-volumes-growth-11603275736258.html,"Stellar September quarter earnings by ACC Ltd raised the bar for cement makers. Competitor Ultratech Cement Ltd not only exceeded the Street’s expectations, but also outperformed ACC on key parameters. UltraTech’s cement volumes grew 7% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 20.1 million tonnes. Analysts were pencilling in a low single-digit volume growth. ACC had earlier reported 1% y-o-y volume growth. UltraTech’s rural market penetration has increased in the past year, driving growth. UltraTech’s volumes got a fillip from rural demand and government spending on infrastructure, chief financial officer Atul Daga said in an interview. He expects demand momentum in the rural areas to continue going ahead.  Dealers channel checks have been indicating pent-up demand in the individual home-building segment, especially from smaller towns. Sequentially, realizations declined given the seasonal weakness in prices, but the fall was lower than expected, analysts said. UltraTech’s tight leash on costs continued, with fixed costs declining by 14% y-o-y in the September quarter. Daga pointed out that some of these costs would make a comeback as normalcy resumes. As expected, increased diesel prices pushed its logistics cost higher. Similarly, costlier fly ash resulted in higher raw material cost. Both these components form around 50% of UltraTech’s overall cost structure. The saving grace was energy costs, which declined around 9% y-o-y due to the use of low-cost petroleum coke. However, sequentially, energy cost moved up. Analysts expect higher pet coke prices to impact UltraTech towards the end of Q3FY21. Strong volumes and strict cost control helped UltraTech’s profit and revenues beat Bloomberg’s consensus analysts’ estimates. Another positive was the net debt reduction of ₹2,519 crore in the September quarter. Consolidated net debt now stands at ₹12,132 crore. UltraTech’s elevated debt has been a concern for investors lately. Daga said that the company aims to bring its net debt/Ebitda below 1x by the end of this financial year. Currently, this metric stands at 1.22x. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Analysts expect the stock’s valuation to improve, aided by strong volume growth and debt reduction. They expect UltraTech’s valuation gap with Shree Cement to narrow from hereon. On a one-year forward EV/Ebitda basis, UltraTech is trading at a valuation multiple of 15 times. It is the second most expensive listed Indian cement stock after Shree Cement Ltd, which trades at an EV/Ebitda multiple of 19 times. EV is short for enterprise value. Meanwhile, the UltraTech stock ended Wednesday’s session at ₹4,631, up around 2%. The stock is close to reclaiming its 52-week high of ₹4,754 seen in January this year."

Driven by higher freight cost and other expenses, Shree Cement’s operating cost per tonne increased 7% on a quarter-on-quarter basis, showed an analysis by Reliance Securities Ltd. This compares with a 2-2.7% sequential decline in the operating cost per tonne of peers ACC Ltd, Ambuja Cements Ltd and Ultratech Cement Ltd. As a result, Shree Cement shares declined 3.80% during the day, making it the top loser among Nifty 50 companies on Tuesday. Note that Shree Cement has the highest valuation multiple among large cement companies. Analysts said it enjoyed this premium valuation for its cost-efficiency, stronger balance sheet and faster market share gains. In this backdrop, rising operating costs have to be closely watched. If they sustain at high levels, then its rich valuations are at risk, said an analyst requesting anonymity.  “We think it is too early to be concerned on Shree Cement’s ability to retain its cost and margin leadership position; nonetheless, margin of safety is low given premium valuations,"" Kotak Institutional Equities analysts said in a report on 10 August. Of course, better realizations can compensate for increasing cost pressures and save any potential margin erosion. But the company’s rising exposure to eastern India, where the pricing outlook is muted due to excessive capacity additions by competitors, could weigh on its realizations. Analysts estimate the eastern region to witness 30-35% capacity expansion by various players over the next two years. Note that Shree Cements, which is aggressively expanding, was looking to double its capacities in six years in its key markets of northern and eastern India. But, the company has pushed back on its large capital expenditure plan due to the current demand uncertainty. As a result, at the end of fiscal 2020, the company had a net cash of nearly ₹3,300 crore. Foreign brokerage house CLSA said Shree Cement’s results indicate the company may have to forego pricing to maintain higher growth. “With the stock trading at a roughly 70% premium to the rest of the coverage, we think high returns and strong balance sheet are more than factored-in,"" it said in a report on 10 August. Both Kotak and CLSA have a sell rating on the stock, citing its expensive valuation. As for the stock’s performance, from its recent high of ₹24,813 in February on the NSE, it is currently around 13% down. Analysts see limited upside in the stock from the current levels unless demand and realizations improve meaningfully."

At 10:20 am, Shree Cement was trading at ₹21,421.95 down 4.32% from its previous close, while the benchmark index, Sensex gained 0.76% to 38,471.45. The company’s revenue fell around 24% at ₹2,480 crore, as against ₹3,302 crore during the last financial year.

Shree Cement reported 22% YoY drop in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to around ₹700 crore, while EBITDA per tonne stood at ₹1,422 in the June quarter of FY21. Analysts at Motilal Oswal in a result note said, ""Shree Cement's home market of northern India remains better placed due to consolidated market structure and lower capacity additions, its increasing exposure to the eastern region is expected to result in blended margin decline. A strong balance sheet ₹3,300 crore net cash at FY2020-end and limited capex provide comfort in the current uncertain demand environment on account of covid-19. We value the stock at 16 times FY2022E Enterprise Value on Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and ammortisation and add the value of the UAE operations at $70 per tonne to arrive at target price of ₹21,500."" The brokerage has a neutral rating on the stock. Shree Cement was able to offset some of the hit due to lower raw material costs. Petcoke prices, a key raw material used to produce cement, were 40% lower during the quarter. Cement prices had also started increasing from May as construction activities restarted. Emkay Global Financial Services in a result note to clients said, ""Cement demand recovery has been much better than our estimates and have increased sales volume assumptions by 14.7%/6.6%/5.5% for FY2021/2022/2023. Historically, Shree Cement has been ahead of most of its peers in capacity expansions, which has helped it to gain market share. The company has aggressive growth plans of doubling its capacities in six years, though there has been some delay due to covid-19-led demand disruption. Capex per ton for Shree Cement is much lower than industry peers and believe that the stock will continue to command premium valuations."" The brokerage has a hold rating on the stock."

A better handle on working capital and sturdy cash flows led to net debt reduction of ₹2,209 crore in the quarter, from its end-March debt of ₹16,860 crore. In a post-earnings conference call, the company’s management said that it remains committed to bring down net debt/Ebitda from 1.7times in FY20 to 1 time in FY21. With net debt reducing in the June quarter, the company’s net debt to Ebitda has improved to 1.44times. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.Analysts say that with increasing focus on debt reduction, the valuation gap between UltraTech and close competitor Shree Cements Ltd should start narrowing. Bloomberg estimates show that on a one-year forward EV/Ebitda basis, the former trades at a multiple of 14times. The latter is the most expensive stock in the sector, with a valuation multiple of 20 times. EV is short for enterprise value. Obviously, it helps that Shree Cements is debt-free.  Meanwhile, the other bright spots in UltraTech’s Q1 results were the lower-than-expected drop in net profit and revenues. As for volumes, the India operations saw a 32% y-o-y decline on a comparable basis to 13.94 million tonnes. Earlier, ACC Ltd and Ambuja Cements Ltd had reported a 33% and 28% drop in volumes respectively for the June quarter. UltraTech’s operating margins also improved by four percentage points, aided by strict cost-control measures. It had initiated an overhead cost-reduction programme with a 10% cost-reduction target, according to its investor presentation. On a y-o-y basis, fixed costs declined 21%, and the company saw a ₹105/tonne cost reduction over the March quarter. Overall, the company scored better than estimates. Shares have now risen more than 9% in the past two trading sessions. Peers ACC and Ambuja Cements had better-than-expected results, especially on the profit margins front, and even UltraTech shares had risen ahead of the results in anticipation. But in the latter’s case, the debt reduction has come as an added bonus. After Tuesday’s sharp rally, analysts see limited upside in the UltraTech stock from the current level, unless the sector’s demand scenario meaningfully improves. The stock now trades at around ₹4,130, and is about 13% lower compared to its high of ₹4,754 earlier in the year. At one point in March, the stock had fallen around 40% from its highs, which shows that investors are pricing in a fairly negligible impact on the company owing to the pandemic. While the debt reduction results in a better valuation, the pressure on volumes perhaps need to be better reflected in valuations of cement stocks. Cost cuts can help profits only to an extent, and investors should brace for an earnings disappointment unless demand bounces back."
Updated: 21 Jul 2020,"ACC results impress the Street, but valuations tell another story",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/street-cheers-acc-june-quarter-earnings-but-valuations-tell-a-different-story-11595304139661.html,"ACC Ltd’s June quarter results were not as bad as the street feared. Revenues fell 37.29% year-on-year (y-o-y) and came in marginally lower than the consensus forecast. Further, the 33% y-o-y decline in cement volumes to 4.8 million tonnes was largely in line with expectations. As the cement sector was a key casualty of the coronavirus crisis, expectations from quarterly earnings were muted. However, the company’s cost-control measures are being seen as a key positive by brokerages. Consequently, ACC’s operating margins improved sequentially in the June quarter. This drove the stock up by about 7% during the day, closing 3.74% up.  The coronavirus-led pain seems to be already factored in. Also, it is not far from this year’s high of ₹1,565.9 seen on 24 January. However, this optimism is unlikely to reflect in its valuations, at least not immediately. The stock is trading at a discount to peers. Bloomberg estimates show that it is quoting at a one-year-forward price-to-earnings multiple of 18 times. On an EV/Ebidta basis, another valuation parameter, ACC’s multiple of 8 times is lower than Ultratech Cements Ltd’s and Shree Cements Ltd’s. EV is enterprise value. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. “We have seen with ACC that earnings performance keeps fluctuating. The market is looking for sustainability of earnings, to assign a higher valuation,"" said an analyst with a domestic brokerage, requesting anonymity. “ACC has been trying to improve its market share, but because of covid its capex plan has been delayed. Unless all that comes back on track, capacity constraints will keep its market share capped,"" said the analyst. Analysis by Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd showed that ACC lost nearly 450 basis points in all-India volume market share over calendar years 2009 to 2016 to 8.2%. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. However, this has been arrested since 2017 and its market share has held at nearly 8.5%. It has seen an 8% annual growth in volumes over calendar years 2016 to 2019, said the broking house. ACC aims to expand in central India, where sales and prices have been aided by rural demand even amid covid-19. Also, analysts said the region has a better utilization outlook. So, once capacity expands, market share gains are likely to follow."
Updated: 01 Jul 2020,"With capex plans delayed, cement sector could see better cash flows",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/with-capex-plans-delayed-cement-sector-could-see-better-cash-flows-11593575964708.html,"The already struggling cement industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis. Management commentaries on demand revival haven’t been very encouraging. So, many cement manufacturers have delayed their capital expenditure (capex) plans. For instance, pan-India focussed cement company the Ultratech Cements Ltd has guided for a capex of ₹10 billion for fiscal year 2021 (FY21). This is lower than the ₹16 billion incurred in fiscal year 2020. In a post earnings conference call with analysts, the company’s management said that it has allocated any capex spend for Dalla Super in FY21. Also, it has deferred capex for the Cuttack grinding unit to FY22. Its peer Shree Cements Ltd will decide on its large capex plan of doubling capacities in six years, after demand conditions improve. Speaking of demand outlook, the company’s management said that it expects more than 20% volume decline in fiscal year 2021. While ACC Ltd is expanding its capacity by 18%, the management expects commissioning to happen by calendar year 2022 – this is after factoring in a likely delay of 6-12 months due to covid-19. Not just pan-India focussed cement companies, a slew of regional firms such as India Cements Ltd, JK Cements Ltd and Orient Cements Ltd, have also postponed their capex plans. According to analysts, leveraged balance sheets of many cement players, who have been on an acquisition spree, should get some breather from this. “The operating cash flow generation has been strong in the recent past but the free cash flow generation has been impacted due to acquisitions and expansions. We expect the industry to focus on cash and, hence, capex would likely come off, which should support free cash flow,"" said a report by Jefferies on 19 June. Although recent cement dealers’ channel check is indicative of pent-demand, one is not sure whether the improvement will last. “Our channel checks with dealers suggest that cement prices receded in June 2020 with easing supply-side constraints. Rural and pent-up demand has led to higher-than-expected volumes in May-June 2020 and the industry could just suffer ~40% yoy decline in 1QFY21E volumes, better than earlier expectations,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report on 24 June."
Updated: 26 May 2020,Will the rally in cement stocks sustain given challenges to demand growth?,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/will-the-rally-in-cement-stocks-sustain-given-challenges-to-demand-ahead-11590483529345.html,"Cement manufacturer Birla Corporation Ltd’s shares vaulted 12% on Tuesday. The stock followed the trend of peers whose shares rose on the back of decent results in the March quarter. ACC Ltd, Ambuja Cements Ltd, UltraTech Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd are up 7-13% since the lockdown was partially eased on 21st April. What is driving this optimism amid macroeconomic gloom? To begin with, investors are positively surprised by the sustained increase in cement prices in May. A report by Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd pointed out, “Our channel checks indicate that cement prices have been increased by ₹20-30/bag in the North, Central and West markets; ₹20-50/bag in the East markets……and ₹40-90/bag in the South region."" (a bag of cement weighs 50 kilograms) Note that cement prices, which were subdued for many quarters had improved since October. The moot question is whether cement prices will continue to rise? Analysts believe that increase in cement offtake and prices after the lockdown was eased is mainly due to pent-up demand. Some dealers feel that the need to complete stalled projects, be it housing or infrastructure, led to spurt in demand. Also, there was a hurry to resume stalled construction, especially in the central and western regions, where the onset of monsoon will again hamper execution. Binod Modi, analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd stated that on the back of demand surge, cement manufacturers hiked prices to meet higher fixed costs and supply chain challenges. “Such abrupt price increases are bound to normalise in the coming weeks, as utilisation levels improve,"" he adds. In the Q4 results analysts’ call, most cement firms indicated a quick ramp up in utilisation levels, since the lockdown was eased. Capacity utilisation was at 65-70% at UltraTech’s plants in mid-May, while Birla Corporation said that it had touched 80%. That said, the commentary by most cement firms on outlook for fiscal 2021, was cautious. Indeed, if cement prices sustain till end-June it would offset the impact on June quarter’s revenue, due to lockdown-led drop in sales volumes. That apart, input costs are bound to remain benign for some time, which will support profitability. Even so, analysts have pencilled a double-digit drop in cement demand for FY21. “Migration of workers could prove to be a roadblock in ramping up construction work,"" adds the Emkay report. Besides, the covid-19 pandemic impact on infrastructure spends by the government and on housing sector, will weigh on cement demand for a few quarters ahead. If these challenges soften cement prices and demand in the months ahead, it would weigh on cement stocks too"
Updated: 11 May 2020,Shree Cement shares gain 3% on strong March quarter; upside capped,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/shree-cement-shares-gain-3-on-strong-march-quarter-upside-capped-11589196726761.html,"MUMBAI: Shares of Shree Cement gained about 3% on Monday after the company's consolidated net profit jumped 57.6% to ₹535.93 crore for the quarter ended March. The shares gained 1.14% to close at ₹18,955 on the BSE, while the benchmark index Sensex lost 0.26% to close at 31,561.22 points. The profit was aided by an improved operational performance even as net sales declined 2.1% to ₹3,415.14 crore in Q4. The cement maker's net profit rose 52.61% to ₹1,535.85 crore on 2.50% increase in net sales to ₹12,868.39 crore in the year ended March . The result was announced after market hours on Friday. Shree Cement’s cement volumes contracted 5% YoY to 6.9 million tonne. The volume was slightly better than ACC and Ambuja, which reported a volume decline of 12 and 10%, respectively. However, strong pricing in north and central regions and low overheads boosted Ebitda. “Shree’s cement vol declined for the first time in past 18 years, and utilisation dropped to a two-decade low of 60%. Despite this, robust pricing in the north/central regions, increased trade focus (80% in FY20), benefits of lower energy cost and lean overheads bolstered its unitary EBITDA in FY20 to ₹1,458/MT (+46% YoY) –its best ever and highest in the industry,"" pointed out an Emkay Global Financial Services report. Ebitda is earnings before, interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Shree Cements enjoys a strong foothold in the northern region. To expand its market presence in western and eastern markets, the company has recently raised ₹2,400 crores of equity via a qualified institutional placement (QIP). However, plans for a pan-India expansion will most likely be put on hold in light of the prevailing demand uncertainty. The company's fuel and power expenses fell 19.84% year-on-year to ₹698.08 crore during the quarter. The stock, however, appears steeply priced. “Despite ascribing premium valuation for its superior cost leadership and profitability margin and strong capex management, the stock price offers no upside,"" said the Emkay report. Motilal Oswal also said, ""The stock trades at 14.4x FY22E EV/EBITDA, which does not offer much upside in our view."" Shree Cement also produces and sells power under the name Shree Power and Shree Mega Power. "
Updated: 11 May 2020,Shree Cement stock valuation prices in profit beat in trying times,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/shree-cement-stock-valuation-prices-in-profit-beat-in-trying-times-11589179471487.html,"Shree Cement Ltd’s efforts to trim costs combined with a favourable market mix led to a strong profit beat in the March quarter (Q4FY20). The company clocked a 772 basis points (bps) jump in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) from the year-ago period, to 33.5%. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. This was higher than Bloomberg’s 14-broker consensus of 31.6%. In addition to lower raw material, power and fuel costs, a phenomenon seen across the industry during the quarter, Shree Cement scored on reducing employee costs. It cut variable salaries of key personnel for FY20. Meanwhile, relatively strong cement prices in the northern region, where Shree Cement has a presence, helped realisations. Even the 5.4% year-on-year (yoy) drop in net cement sales was not as bad as the 10-11% drop in sales of peers Ambuja Cements Ltd and ACC Ltd during the quarter. So, the 2% yoy drop in standalone revenue (including a small portion from the power segment) can be attributed to the lockdown and standstill in sales in the last week of March. Shree Cement’s ebitda/tonne too jumped by about 34% yoy, sustaining the trend of being among the most profitable listed cement firms. Be that as it may, April and May marked the beginning of a weak FY21. “The company will decide on its large capital expenditure plan (doubling of capacities in six years) after demand conditions improve as management expects 20%+ volume decline in FY21,"" says a report by Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. Inspite of this, Shree Cement’s stock has recovered 23% from its 52-week low on 3 April. News of easing lockdown, especially for the construction sector and resumption of activity in semi-urban and rural infrastructure projects, has improved investor sentiment. But, looks like the valuations of 27 times the enterprise value/ebitda of the company prices the company’s profitability beat in tough times. Therefore, it leaves no room for negative surprises ahead, say analysts on the Street."
