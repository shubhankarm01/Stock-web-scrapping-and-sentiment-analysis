Updated: 08 Jul 2022,How an Indian cement maker bought Russian coal using yuan,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/exclusive-how-an-indian-cement-maker-bought-russian-coal-using-yuan-11657240560306.html,"An Indian cement maker's recent purchase of Russian coal using yuan involved India's biggest private lender, HDFC Bank, according to an invoice seen by Reuters and a source, as more details emerge of the kind of trade that could blunt Western sanctions against Moscow. There is no suggestion that the purchase, the particulars of which have not previously been reported, in any way breaches sanctions imposed on Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. But the document shows one way in which Russia could continue to sell commodities abroad without settling in U.S. dollars despite restrictions aimed at freezing it out of financial markets. According to the invoice dated June 5 and a source familiar with the matter, HDFC Bank backed cement maker Ultratech's purchase of Russian coal from producer and trader SUEK for 172.7 million yuan ($25.74 million). The letter of credit for the deal was issued by HDFC Bank's Mumbai suburban branch of Andheri East, according to the invoice.  The dollar is the currency of choice for global trade in raw materials, but some traders say the yuan could be increasingly used to settle payments for supplies from Russia.  In the invoice, SUEK requests Ultratech remit the 172.7 million yuan to SUEK's account at the Shanghai branch of China Everbright Bank. SUEK lists the Hong Kong branch of international lender HSBC as the correspondent bank.  A correspondent bank acts as a middleman in the transfer of money from one bank to another. Reuters could not determine if a payment had been received by China Everbright or if HSBC or any other bank was involved in a transfer of funds.  HDFC Bank and HSBC declined to comment. Ultratech, SUEK and China Everbright Bank did not respond to requests for comment. It was not clear from the invoice which currencies were used to effect the yuan payment.  The amount listed was quoted in Chinese yuan and Reuters reported last week that Ultratech imported 157,000 tonnes of coal from Switzerland-registered SUEK and agreed to settle the final payment in that currency. YUAN TRADES STILL RARE For India, such payment methods could become more common as it seeks to maintain trade ties with Russia for commodities including oil and coal without the risk of contravening Western sanctions. India has deep political and security ties with Russia and has refrained from condemning the Ukraine war, which Russia says is a ""special military operation"". India's energy imports from Russia have soared recently as traders, unable to sell into many Western markets, have offered steep discounts. New Delhi defends its purchases of Russian goods, saying they are legal and that a sudden halt would inflate prices further and hurt consumers. Greater use of the yuan to settle payments could help insulate Moscow from punishment and bolster Beijing's push to further internationalise the yuan and chip away at the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global trade. It is, however, still rare for an Indian firm to agree to settle a trade with a non-Chinese company in yuan. In the absence of sanctions, overseas payments to Russian commodity and energy companies would typically be made in dollars via SWIFT to Russian accounts. For Indian trade settlements using the yuan, lenders would potentially send dollars to foreign banks with sufficient yuan reserves, or Chinese banks they have tie-ups with, in exchange for yuan to settle the trade. The invoice mentioned the SWIFT transaction IDs of both HSBC's Hong Kong branch and China Everbright's Shanghai branch. Reuters could not confirm whether any payment was made using the SWIFT platform. SWIFT is a secure messaging system that facilitates rapid cross-border payments, making international trade flow smoothly. Several Russian banks have been cut off from the system in recent months. ""As a matter of policy, SWIFT does not comment on flows between institutions,"" a spokesman said. India's bilateral trade with China, for which companies largely pay in dollars, has flourished even after a deadly military border clash between the two in 2020 that ratcheted up tensions that have still not subsided. New Delhi has increased scrutiny on Chinese investments and imports, and banned some mobile apps over security concerns. The Indian government and the central bank were aware of potential payments for Russian cargo in Chinese yuan, sources told Reuters last week. The government and central bank did not comment for this article."
Updated: 05 Jul 2022,Cloud over cement cos’ profitability as prices dip in June,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/cloud-over-cement-cos-profitability-as-prices-dip-in-june-11656964110857.html,"NEW DELHI : Cement prices slipped for a second consecutive month in June, channel checks by various brokerages showed, dampening the near-term outlook for cement stocks. “Our interactions with dealers, sales executives and C&F agents in the cement sector reveal that after a subdued May, cement firms attempted price hikes in early June, but barring a few markets with flat prices, other markets registered a further dip in June,"" said analysts at Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd. The all-India average retail price of cement fell to ₹379 for a 50kg bag, down ₹11 from the preceding month, as per analysts. An improvement in cement prices is essential for cement manufacturers to take care of rising costs. Prices of coking coal and pet coke have remained elevated on the back of higher crude prices. Per-tonne profitability of most cement companies (Ebitda/tonne) had declined by 5-34% year-on-year during the March quarter, and the pressure is likely to be felt more in the June quarter as rise costlier raw materials reflect in profitability with a lag. In another report, analysts at JM Financials said average cement prices continued to witness a decline of 2.3% month-on-month in June. This was led by a steep correction in prices in the East, followed by Central and West India, whereas prices in North and South remained flat on a month-on-month basis. Notably, this is the second month of decline; in May, cement prices had seen a 2.8% decline as per JM Financial. Global coal prices have surged 30% and FOB Kalimantan Prices have almost doubled as per S&P Global commodity insight. Emkay Global Financial Services analysts expect margin pressure to continue in the near term due to elevated costs and weak realizations amid a seasonally weak demand period. Factoring in higher cost inflation and lower utilization levels than before, Emkay has cut its EBITDA estimates for the sector by 5-6% for FY23/24/25. Ebitda stands for Earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation. They have cut also cut target multiples by 4-17% across coverage companies. This comes on top of weak sales during the monsoon season due to subdued construction activities. Any price recovery thereby is most likely expected to be after the end of monsoon. The first half outlook for cement companies thereby remains muted, as per analysts. “Earnings for UltraTech as well as the cement sector are expected to remain under pressure in 1HFY23 and lower than our earlier estimate,"" said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services."
Updated: 01 Jul 2022,What’s dragging down UltraTech Cement?,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/ultratech-cement-stock-valuations-have-tapered-but-that-s-not-enough-11656610594381.html,"UltraTech Cement Ltd’s shares have fallen by as much as 26% so far this calendar year. Investor concerns are understandable. Cost inflation has been a pressing worry and margins are expected to be under pressure during the first half of financial year 2023 (H1FY23). Prices of coal and petroleum coke, key inputs used in making cement, remain painfully high, weighing on profitability. “Earnings for UltraTech Cement as well as the cement sector are expected to remain under pressure in H1FY23 and lower than our earlier estimate because of sustained cost pressures (we expect a ₹300-350 per tonne increase in energy costs in H1FY23); the recent decline in cement prices, which came under pressure in June 2022; lower than our estimated growth in cement demand in Q1FY23; and the tendency to increase capacities by different players,"" said a report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services on 29 June.

Updated: 29 Jun 2022,UltraTech Cement paying for Russian coal in Chinese yuan: Report,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ultratech-cement-paying-for-russian-coal-in-chinese-yuan-report-11656495919667.html,"India's biggest cement producer, UltraTech Cement, is importing a cargo of Russian coal and paying using Chinese yuan, according to an Indian customs document reviewed by Reuters, a rare payment method that traders say could become more common. UltraTech is bringing in 157,000 tonnes of coal from Russian producer SUEK that loaded on the bulk carrier MV Mangas from the Russian Far East port of Vanino, the document showed. It cites an invoice dated June 5 that values the cargo at 172,652,900 yuan ($25.81 million). Two trade sources familiar with the matter said the cargo's sale was arranged by SUEK's Dubai-based unit, adding that other companies have also placed orders for Russian coal using yuan payments. The increasing use of the yuan to settle payments could help insulate Moscow from the effects of western sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine and bolster Beijing's push to further internationalise the currency and chip away at the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global trade. The sources declined to be identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media. UltraTech and SUEK did not respond to a request seeking comment. ""This move is significant. I have never heard any Indian entity paying in yuan for international trade in the last 25 years of my career. This is basically circumventing the USD (U.S. dollar),"" a Singapore-based currency trader said. The sale highlights how India has maintained trade ties with Russia for commodities such as oil and coal despite the western sanctions. India has longstanding political and security ties with Russia and has refrained from condemning the attack in Ukraine, which Russia says is a ""special military operation"". It was not immediately clear which bank opened a letter of credit for UltraTech and how the transaction with SUEK was executed. SUEK did not respond to a request seeking comment. The Mangas is currently at anchor near the Indian port of Kandla, according to ship-tracking data on Refinitiv Eikon. INDIA-CHINA-RUSSIA TRADE India has explored setting up a rupee payment mechanism for trade with Russia, but that has not materialized. Chinese businesses have used the yuan in trade settlements with Russia for years. For Indian trade settlements using the yuan, lenders would potentially have to send dollars to branches in China or Hong Kong, or Chinese banks they have tie-ups with, in exchange for yuan to settle the trade, two senior Indian bankers said. ""If the rupee-yuan-rouble route turns out to be favourable, the businesses have every reason and incentive to switch over. This is likely to happen more,"" said Subash Chandra Garg, a former economic affairs secretary at India's finance ministry. India's bilateral trade with China, for which companies largely pay in dollars, has flourished even after a deadly military clash between the two in 2020, though New Delhi has increased scrutiny on Chinese investments and imports, and banned some mobile apps over security concerns. An Indian government official familiar with the matter said the government was aware of payments in yuan. ""The use of the yuan to settle payments for imports from countries other than China was rare until now, and could increase due to sanctions on Russia,"" the official said. India's energy imports from Russia have spiked in the recent weeks as traders have offered steep discounts, Reuters reported this month. New Delhi defends its purchases of Russian goods saying a sudden halt would inflate prices and hurt consumers. Business units of Russian coal traders in Dubai have become active hubs for facilitating deals with India in the recent weeks, as Singapore has grown wary of provoking western nations that invoked sanctions against Russia, said multiple coal traders based in Russia, Singapore, India and Dubai. A Russian coal trader based in Dubai said the biggest challenge was sending roubles to Russia. ""You can either take payments in yuan in Dubai, or receive it in dollars or (Arab Emirates) dhiram and convert it to rouble"" he said, adding it was easier to convert the yuan to rouble and was preferred over other currencies.

Updated: 29 Jun 2022,Is the ‘waste heat recovery system’ a saviour for cement companies?,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/cement-cos-esg-issue-has-no-easy-solution-11656436082234.html,"Cement companies continue to make new investments in waste heat recovery systems (WHRS) installations. The sector’s overall cost has spiked in recent quarters mainly because of high fuel costs. Against this backdrop, WHRS is a saviour. It traps the enormous heat generated during manufacturing and generates electricity, which can be used as an additional source of power. Thus, it helps reduce energy costs. If about 10% of power is consumed from WHRS, it could help cement companies save Rs50 per tonne, according to an analysis by Yes Securities. Analysts estimate that the average power generation cost from WHRS is less than Re1 per unit compared to Rs5 per unit from the grid. Power and fuel account for 25-30% of the sector’s total operating costs.       "
Updated: 24 Jun 2022,Top picks: Sharekhan is bullish on these 6 cement stocks for robust gain ahead,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/top-picks-sharekhan-is-bullish-on-these-6-cement-stocks-for-robust-gain-ahead-11656089157281.html,"The leading brokerage firm Sharekhan has placed a buy call rating on the shares of Shree Cement for a target price (TP) of ₹26000, Ultratech Cement (TP: ₹7100), Grasim Industries (TP: ₹1740), The Ramco Cement (TP: ₹850), JK Lakshmi Cement (TP: ₹600), and Dalmia Bharat (TP: 1850). These recommendations were made because the brokerage forecasts that, in accordance with the plans disclosed by major cement players, the cement sector would add more than 90 mtpa in capacity between FY2023 and FY2025. The brokerage has said in a note that “Cement industry is expected to add over 90 mtpa in capacities over FY2023- FY2025 as per plans announced by major players. This implies a 5% CAGR in installed capacity, while cement demand is estimated to post a 6-7% CAGR over FY2023-FY2025. With the rise in supply almost equivalent to demand growth, industry capacity utilizations levels would stay almost flat at 67-68% over FY2023- FY2025. Pan-India cement prices have risen each year during FY2015-FY2022 barring a couple of years, while in Q1FY2023, they are up 8% as compared to FY2022 level. Going by historical anecdotes, we believe cement prices to remain on an uptrend despite capacity additions over the next three years. On the cost front, International petcoke prices have corrected by 17% m-o-m and 20% from March 2022 levels in June 2022."" According to Sharekhan “The diesel prices across Metros declined by 5% m-o-m while they were up 3% y-o-y in June 2022. We expect the easing of petcoke/ coal prices during Q1FY2023 and ahead to reflect in operational performance for the industry from H2FY2023 as it exhausts high-cost fuel inventory fully during H1FY2023. We estimate our cement coverage universe to report 11% CAGR in sales volume over FY2022-FY2024 as against industry growth estimated at 6-7% per annum. Higher-than-industry growth is expected to be lead by market share gains by larger companies aided by rise in capacities."" The brokerage has claimed that “We estimate weighted average EBITDA/tonne for our coverage universe to grow at 4% CAGR during FY2022- FY2024 although the same may remain lower than peaks seen in FY2021. The improvement in EBITDA/tone is based on our assumptions of capacity utilizations remaining almost flat due to high capacity additions, part retention of growth in cement prices and easing of energy and freight costs."" By staying positive on the cement sector, Sharekhan has said “Our cement coverage universe has seen 30%-45% correction in stock prices over trailing five months led by Russia-Ukraine crisis, rise in energy costs and large capacity plans announced by leading cement players. The same has led to one year forward EV/EBITDA valuation multiples of almost all cement companies sinking below their historical averages. Notwithstanding, soft earnings performance for the cement pack in H1FY23, the recent correction offers good entry points for long term investors as sustainable infrastructure push over next 3-5 years coupled with easing out of input cost pressure in H2FY23E would drive stock performance over next 12-15 months. We remain construction and stay Positive on the sector. Our preferred picks are UltraTech, Shree Cement, Dalmia Bharat and JK Lakshmi Cement."" Weakness in demand, a decline in cement prices and a rise in key input costs like energy and freight costs are key risks to the industry, said Sharekhan, which investors should take note of.

Updated: 07 Jun 2022,The Adani versus Birla battle in a prized market for cement,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/the-adani-versus-birla-battle-in-a-prized-market-for-cement-11654619859936.html,"Gautam Adani’s meteoric rise to the world’s ninth-richest person began with a port on India’s west coast in the 1990s and friendship with a politician who’s now prime minister. The rest has been all about finding the next industry that will enlarge his debt-fuelled empire. The port brought in coal, liquefied gas and palm oil, and so Adani got into these and adjacent businesses. Once he began supplying coal to power plants, he entered mining and electricity generation and distribution. He supplied piped gas to Indian cities, and set out to harvest solar and wind power. Extending his dominance in logistics to owning airports, grain silos and data centres was logical, as was selling a cooking medium: He just had to refine Indonesian palm-oil arriving at Indian ports, of which he now owns 13. Finally, if the group was going to create infrastructure, why not produce cement? In its most recent expansion, Adani is paying $10.5 billion. In this field, his challenger isn’t arch-rival Mukesh Ambani, the only Indian tycoon richer than Adani, it’s another billionaire. Kumar Mangalam Birla comes from old money, unlike Adani, a first-generation entrepreneur. His great-grandfather, who diversified from textile trading to jute manufacturing and a lot else, was a confidant of Mahatma Gandhi during India’s freedom struggle. Birla’s father, stymied by a post-1947 socialist turn, globalized the commodities conglomerate by expanding in Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines. Birla bought Novelis in 2007 to become the world’s largest aluminium-rolling firm. But then Birla had to deal with the 2008 financial crisis, followed by a boom-bust in China’s commodities demand and a long expensive entanglement in telecom, an industry disrupted by Ambani’s 2016 foray with cheap data and free voice calls. While a government-backed rescue for Vodafone Idea Ltd has prevented it from going belly up, a new battle has begun. Adani is challenging Birla in India’s vast and expanding market for cement. No surprise then that Adani’s Holcim India acquisition evoked a quick response. Birla-controlled UltraTech Cement Ltd has announced a capital expenditure of ₹12,900 crore to increase its cement capacity by 22.6 million tonnes per annum. That works out to $75 per tonne. Adani is paying almost double that per tonne for taking over an estimated 73 million tonnes per annum capacity this year at the two Holcim units, Ambuja Cements and ACC. If Adani is going to buy scale at a premium, Birla will build cheap. The game is on. Birla’s telecom business got bruised when Ambani waged a price war. But it’ll be hard for Adani to beat Birla in the latter’s family borough of cement. Birla, who was worth $6.5 billion in early 2013 when Adani wasn’t even a billionaire, is now almost $85 billion behind. But he knows his cement: UltraTech’s current capacity of about 120 million tonnes per annum gives it a market share of 20%, ahead of the 12% Adani just acquired. It isn’t, however, an assured lead. As Kotak Institutional Equities has noted, Adani has the option of expanding to 100 million tonnes relatively cheaply, at $80- 90 per tonne. That’ll cut his acquisition cost. UltraTech has a $3.20-$3.90 advantage over Holcim in how much earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization it can eke out per tonne. Kotak says that Adani can close the gap by merging the two acquired firms, ending royalties to Holcim and saving costs via waste heat recovery. But Birla isn’t without options. He, too, will enter adjacent industries, such as paints. It’s too early to say who will win India’s building-material war, though one thing is certain: Birla won’t take another challenger lightly. In 2017, when he decided to merge his Idea with Vodafone’s India business, he may have thought that scale would protect him from relentless pricing attack by Ambani’s Reliance Jio. It didn’t. The government won a case in the Supreme Court over past dues from cellular firms, putting Vodafone Idea’s survival in doubt. Finally, New Delhi had to offer a bailout to prevent the telco market from becoming a Reliance-led duopoly. Cement isn’t as highly regulated as telecom. But Birla must still rue the ease with which Adani beat his rival bid—and one more by another Indian billionaire—for Holcim’s assets by agreeing to take over any liability emanating from a price-fixing case brought by India’s trustbuster. The real question before Birla, however, runs deeper. If Adani plans to dethrone him as India’s king of cement, what’s the right response: Fight or flight? His great-grandfather, the patriotic Ghanshyam Das Birla, bet on Gandhi and won against British rulers and their companies like Andrew Yule & Co. Going up against Adani, who also views himself as a nationalist businessman, may be no less of a gamble in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s India. Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services in Asia."

After the completion of this round of expansion, Ultratech’s grey cement capacity will grow to 159.25 mtpa. That Ultratech would expand capacity was expected, but the sector is going through a rough patch now. As things stand, cement demand is yet to see a meaningful recovery and the industry’s pricing power remains weak. Aggregate volumes of the sector rose sequentially, but were flattish year-on-year, reckon analysts. Dealer channel checks by various brokerages show cement demand improved in April-May, but only slightly. With the onset of the rainy season, demand is likely to be subdued in June.         "

The company's Board of Directors has approved a cement capacity increase of 22.6 million tonnes at a cost of Rs129 billion, which the company plans to finish by FY25. Based on the new CAPEX disclosed, ICICI Securities has maintained a buy call on UltraTech Cement shares with a target price of ₹8,500, representing a 49.71 per cent upside potential from the last traded price of ₹5,677.60. ICICI Securities has said in a report that “UltraTech Cement’s (UTCEM) board has approved cement capacity expansion of 22.6mnte (~17% of expected FY23 India operations base of 130.9mnte) at a capex of ~Rs129bn (US$76/te which the company expects to complete by FY25. The fresh round of capacity expansion will take UTCEM’s total India grey cement capacity to ~154mnte from current 114.6mnte, implying 10.4% CAGR during the next three years. Factoring-in the said expansion, industry has announced ~110mnte capacities to be added over the next three years with UTCEM alone adding 35% of it and nearly two-thirds of the additions by the top-4 group."" The brokerage has claimed that “Hence, this would lead to better industry consolidation and better pricing, in our view. Besides, based on historical trends, many of these capacities may get delayed and speed of execution would depend on demand growth. We believe UTCEM, with its large pan-India diversified market presence, premium brand positioning, timely capacity creation, increased cost efficiencies and strong balance sheet is better placed to gain market share / improve margins in the medium term. We continue to value UTCEM at 15x FY24E EV/E and maintain BUY rating with a target price of Rs8,500/sh. Key risk: Lower demand / pricing, and sharp cost escalations."" ICICI Securities has also said that many of the announced 110mnte capacity additions may get delayed due to various reasons (based on historical trends). For example, recent cost pressures may shrink profitability of the industry participants, especially for mid and smaller companies in the short-term, and the resultant cash flows available for capex may shrink. This could lead to delay in implementation of the announced expansions. The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint."

Mtpa is short for million tonnes per annum. The capacity increase would be through a mix of brownfield and greenfield expansions. The management said in a press release the commercial production from these new capacities is expected to go on stream in a phased manner, by FY25. Further, UltraTech’s current expansion program is on track and estimated to be completed by the end of FY23, added the release. Note that post the completion of the latest round of expansion, Ultratech's grey capacity will grow to 159.25 mtpa. Analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd point out that the next phase of expansion will support volume growth and help Ultratech retain its leadership position. ""In our current forecasts, we have modelled capacity/volume CAGRs of 7%/9% over FY22-25E. Factoring-in next phase of capacity addition by FY25, we see 7% upside to our current capacity estimates and ~5% upside for volume forecast of FY26,"" said the Emkay report. CAGR is short for compounded annual growth rate. Yet, reacting to this development, shares of the company declined by 2.5% on the NSE in Friday's early trade. ""In current times of weak demand, high fuel costs and entry of a new company in the sector, any significant capacity announcement may be viewed negatively by the market,"" added the Emkay report. Recently, Adani Group inked a pact to acquire Holcim's business in India, which comprises its 63.11% stake in Ambuja Cement Ltd, which owns a 50.05% interest in ACC Ltd, as well as its 4.48% direct stake in ACC. Secondly, analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd now expect Ultratech to turn net cash positive in FY26 from FY24 earlier, in the backdrop of fresh capex. While the domestic brokerage house is positive on the long-term prospects of the cement sector, in the near-term it expects cement stocks to remain under pressure."
Updated: 03 Jun 2022,UltraTech doubles down on capex plan,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ultratech-doubles-down-on-capex-plan-11654194732009.html,"MUMBAI : UltraTech Cement Ltd, the country’s largest maker of the building material, said it would spend ₹12,866 crore on adding 22.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) capacity, just weeks after the Aditya Birla group flagship lost the race to acquire Holcim Ltd’s India cement assets to billionaire Gautam Adani. The acquisition of Ambuja Cements Ltd and its unit ACC Ltd, with a cement manufacturing capacity of almost 70 mtpa, is set to make the Adani Group the second-biggest cement maker in the country and the chief rival of UltraTech. The race to expand capacity comes as the government plans to spend a record ₹7.50 trillion this year to build roads and ports to boost growth, increasing demand for building materials such as cement. In addition, the revival of capital spending by the private sector, including construction firms, is also expected to boost cement demand. On Thursday, the board of UltraTech approved the plan to increase capacity through a mix of brownfield and greenfield expansion. The additional capacity will be created across the country and would include setting up integrated and grinding units as well as bulk terminals, the company said in a statement. “The company has more than doubled its capacity over the last five years and is committed to meeting India’s future needs for housing, roads, and other infrastructure,"" Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of Aditya Birla Group, said on Thursday. “This investment is backed by a strong conviction on India’s growth potential as well as a deep and nuanced understanding of the market dynamics of the cement industry. Given the size of the investment outlay, I am confident that this new capacity creation will have a multiplier effect, leading to jobs and growth across regions in India."" The national elections in 2024 are also expected to boost demand for cement as the central and state governments announce new projects and complete planned ones to lure voters. “With the central elections in 2024, we expect demand to pick up meaningfully next year with the government’s focus on infrastructure and rural growth. We would note that in the previous instance (FY19), demand grew by low double digits,"" an April report by brokerage CLSA said. Commercial production from UltraTech’s new capacities is expected to start in a phased manner by FY25. Its current expansion programme is also on track and is estimated to be completed by the end of FY23, the company added. Upon completion of the latest round of expansion, the company’s capacity will rise to 159.25 mtpa, reinforcing its position as the third-largest cement company in the world, outside of China. Its current cement capacity stands at 119.95 mtpa. On Thursday, shares of UltraTech Cement rose 0.5% to ₹6,007.35 on BSE, while the benchmark Sensex gained 0.79%. UltraTech’s announcement adds to the spate of investments that Aditya Birla group has planned to implement across its businesses, from aluminium to paints. Last month, the American unit of the group’s aluminium business Hindalco Industries Ltd, the world’s largest aluminium rolling firm, said it would invest $2.5 billion to build a new recycling and rolling plant in the US in the largest greenfield expansion plan by the parent group. The Novelis Inc. facility in Alabama will have an initial annual capacity to produce 600 kilotonnes of finished aluminium goods and will be completed by FY26. The group has also doubled its investments in its paints business housed under Grasim Industries Ltd. Grasim said it will double investments in its paints business to ₹10,000 crore by FY25."

The capacity expansion will be undertaken at a cost of $76 per tonne of cement. In a meeting held on Thursday, the board of the Aditya Birla Group firm approved the expansion plans, according to an UltraTech Cement regulatory filing. ""The Board of Directors at its meeting held today approved capex of ₹12,886 crores towards increasing capacity by 22.6 MTPA with a mix of brownfield and greenfield expansion,"" the company said. The investment, which will cater to the ""future growth"" of the company, will be funded through a mix of debt and internal accruals, UltraTech said. ""This would be achieved by setting up integrated and grinding units as well as bulk terminals. The additional capacity will be created across the country,"" it noted. UltraTech said the commercial production from these new capacities is expected to go on stream in a phased manner by FY25. Currently, UltraTech's production capacity is 119.95 MTPA and after the completion of the sanctioned expansion along with the current expansion programmes, which are estimated to be completed by FY23, it would go up to 159.25 MTPA. ""Upon completion of the latest round of expansion, the company's capacity will grow to 159.25 MTPA, reinforcing its position as the third-largest cement company in the world, outside of China,"" it added. ‘Significant milestone in UltraTech's growth journey’ Aditya Birla Group Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said this ambitious capacity expansion plan is a significant milestone in the ongoing transformational growth journey of UltraTech. ""The company has more than doubled its capacity over the last five years and is committed to meeting India's future needs for housing, roads, and other infrastructure. This investment is backed by a strong conviction on India's growth potential as well as a deep and nuanced understanding of the market dynamics of the cement industry,"" he said. UltraTech has 22 integrated manufacturing units, 27 grinding units, one clinkerisation unit and 8 bulk packaging terminals. It has a network of over one lakh channel partners across the country and has a market reach of more than 80 per cent. Its nearest rival was Holcim India, which with its two Indian units - Ambuja Cements and ACC, has a combined installed production capacity of 70 MTPA. In May, Holcim India's swiss parent firm had signed a binding agreement with the Adani Group to sell its business in India in a deal estimated to be around $10.5 billion."
Updated: 12 May 2022,UltraTech bids for Holcim units as bidders seek more access,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ultratech-bids-for-holcim-units-as-bidders-seek-more-access-11652294781879.html,"MUMBAI :   UltraTech Cement Ltd, India’s largest cement maker, has submitted a non-binding bid for Holcim Ltd’s Indian assets Ambuja Cements Ltd and ACC Ltd, two people aware of the development said. Details about UltraTech’s bid could not be immediately ascertained. A spokesperson for Aditya Birla Group, which controls the cement maker, declined to comment. Meanwhile, companies seeking to acquire Ambuja Cements and ACC are finding it difficult to price their bids as the Swiss company has allowed them limited access to inspect the assets of the two companies, the people said, requesting anonymity. Holcim has asked interested parties to submit their best indicative offer, along with letters of support from lenders or investors for financing the offers, the people said, seeking anonymity. Companies that bid the highest will then be allowed to conduct comprehensive due diligence and submit binding offers, they added. However, prospective bidders are unsure what value to ascribe to the two Holcim companies with the limited information they have at this stage. “Given the nature of the business, one needs to conduct proper diligence of the companies’ assets, especially limestone linkages, since they are critical for day-to-day operations and growth. Having significant limestone reserves is critical for any cement business and, thus, the reserves feed significantly into the valuation. New reserves can only be bought through auctions or by acquiring a company. Sourcing limestone from the market increases costs of operations, affecting margins. So, it is a very critical component of valuing a cement company,"" one of the two people said. Even some lenders have expressed concern since they have to fund the offer with limited information about the assets they are backing, the people cited above added. “Some of the large foreign banks have agreed to offer letters of intent but have told the bidders that the final call on underwriting the bid will depend on the valuation that emerges after the bidder undertakes a comprehensive due diligence,"" the second person said. A spokesperson for Holcim declined to comment. Holcim owns a 63.19% stake in Ambuja Cements through Holderind Investments Ltd, while Ambuja Cements holds a 50.05% stake in ACC, and Holderind directly owns 4.48% of ACC. The combined market value of the companies stood at over ₹1.11 trillion as of Wednesday. A successful stake sale will make it one of the biggest M&A deals in India. Several large corporate groups have shown interest in buying the Holcim companies, including Adani Group, JSW Group and Dalmia Bharat. Mint reported on Monday that Adani Group had prepared a bid of almost $13.5 billion for the deal. Mint reported that Adani Group entities may invest close to $11 billion in buying Holcim’s stake in Ambuja and ACC, which includes a premium to the market price. Additionally, $2.5-3 billion may be invested in buying the shares of Ambuja Cements and ACC from public shareholders. Adani Group has already formed a wholly owned subsidiary under Adani Enterprises Ltd called Adani Cement Industries in June last year. In Gujarat, Adani has been planning to set up a fly ash-based cement manufacturing facility and a small 5 million tonnes per annum cement plant in Maharashtra with an initial investment of up to ₹1,000 crore. UltraTech has also drawn up a plan to clear the antitrust hurdle. The plan involves the company selling assets in markets where the combined entities may end up with a substantial market share."

Updated: 03 May 2022,The growing list of Holcim India suitors,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/dalmia-may-join-race-for-holcim-s-india-biz-11651517115374.html,"MUMBAI : Cement maker Dalmia Bharat Ltd is set to throw its hat in the ring to buy Holcim Ltd’s India businesses, joining a hotly contested race that has garnered interest from conglomerates including Adani, JSW and Aditya Birla groups, two people aware of the development said. Dalmia Bharat, one of India’s oldest cement makers, is talking to banks to stitch together the financing for its bid for the Swiss building materials maker’s two Indian cement companies—ACC Ltd and Gujarat Ambuja Ltd—with a combined manufacturing capacity of almost 65 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), the people said, requesting anonymity. Dalmia’s current capacity is 35 mtpa.  Meanwhile, Aditya Birla Group’s UltraTech Cement, the country’s largest cement maker with a capacity of 119.95 mtpa, is drawing up a plan to ensure its bid for Ambuja and ACC doesn’t hit the antitrust hurdle, the people cited above said. UltraTech fears its bid to acquire an additional 65 mtpa of Holcim’s cement assets will be closely scrutinized by the competition regulator. To ensure it doesn’t fall foul of antitrust laws, UltraTech will likely offer to offload some assets to ensure the combined market share of UltraTech and Holcim businesses does not exceed 40%, one of the two people cited above said. The strong interest of Indian firms in buying Holcim’s India businesses is because many believe that an opportunity to acquire such a major asset is unlikely to be available anytime soon. The companies expect the purchase to give them economies of scale and pricing power. Holcim has been divesting some of its non-core assets, including its Brazilian unit for $1 billion in September. It’s also planning to sell its factories in Russia. Emails to spokespeople for Dalmia Bharat and UltraTech Cement did not elicit a response till press time. Mint reported previously that the Holcim board is expected to meet this week to decide on the offers for its Indian businesses. Dalmia Bharat is seeking letters of intent from its banks as soon as 3 May to meet bid conditions, the second person said. Dalmia Bharat, which set up its first cement plant in 1939, has pursued major acquisitions in the past, although it lost out to rivals in many of the major deals. In 2018, it lost out on acquiring Binani Cements, which was scooped up by Aditya Birla’s UltraTech Cement. Earlier in 2016, it was also engaged in the race to acquire French cement maker Lafarge’s cement assets in India, which were put on the block as part of Lafarge and Holcim’s global merger. To be sure, Dalmia Bharat has picked up smaller assets, including Murli Industries and Kalyanpur Cements. Brokerages have a positive outlook on both Ambuja and ACC stocks even as near-term profitability is expected to be weak. “Cement profitability has been hit hard due to a sharp rise in coal and pet coke costs since January. We expect most of the impact to be reflected in earnings in 1HFY23. That said, per our channel checks, there is a likelihood of an 8-10% price increase in April. Moreover, historically, as costs have softened, companies have retained part of the benefit leading to margin expansion. Hence, we expect FY23 profitability to be much weaker, but estimate a sharp improvement in FY24 in both volume and profitability,"" said CLSA in a report on 7 April. The brokerage has upgraded Ambuja to ‘buy’ while retaining its buy rating on ACC."

The bids for the two assets are expected to be upwards of $10 billion,"" said one of the two people cited above. Holcim owns a 63.19% stake in Ambuja Cements through Holderind Investments Ltd, while Ambuja Cements holds a 50.05% stake in ACC, and Holderind directly owns 4.48%. The companies’ combined market capitalization stood at over ₹1.19 trillion as of Tuesday. A stake sale will trigger an open offer to acquire shares from public investors of the companies. A successful sale by Holcim will also make it one of the biggest deals in India. Meanwhile, bidders have been busy tying up funding for their offers. “JSW Group arm JSW Cement has the backing of a couple of US private equity funds keen on this opportunity, while Adani has tied up with multiple foreign banks for the funding,"" said the second person cited above. “For Adani and JSW, this is a great opportunity to acquire existing large scale cement operations with strong market share. Both groups are expected to chase this deal aggressively as a business of this size won’t be available for many years to come. For Ultratech, Competition Commission approval may prove to be a challenge, given their leadership position in the market,"" added the second person. UltraTech has a consolidated capacity of 119.95 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), while JSW Cement has a capacity of 14 mtpa. Ambuja Cement has a cement capacity of 31 mtpa with six integrated cement manufacturing plants and eight cement grinding units across the country, while ACC has a capacity of 34.45 mtpa.

Updated: 18 Apr 2022,What Holcim's likely exit from India means for cement sector's pricing power,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/what-holcim-s-likely-exit-from-india-means-for-cement-sector-s-pricing-power-11650268693591.html,"The cement sector is in the headlines, yet again, but this time, it is not for cost inflation pressure issues. Investors in the sector may need to prepare for the announcement of a landmark deal. Media reports said Switzerland-based building materials conglomerate Holderind Investments Ltd (Holcim) is looking to exit India and is exploring a stake sale in Ambuja Cements Ltd. Holcim holds a 63.19% stake in Ambuja and a 4.48% stake in ACC Ltd. It should be noted that Ambuja also holds a 50.05% stake in ACC. Clearly, if and when such a deal goes through, there would be repercussions not on these stocks but for other companies as well. For ACC and Ambuja a change of ownership could be a re-rating event, note analysts. Investors would reckon that both these companies have been losing market share due to capacity constraints. This is at a time when their close competitors Ultratech Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd were expanding their footprints across regions aggressively. During the calendar year 2011-2016, Holcim lost 460 basis points (bps) market share due to weaker capacity addition, according to Axis Securities Ltd. One basis point is 0.01%. During this period, Shree Cement and UltraTech added 220 bps and 630 bps of volume share, respectively, said the Axis report. Perhaps, a whiff of this potential deal has got investors excited. In April so far, the Ambuja stock has sharply outperformed peers ACC, Ultratech and the broader market, likely reflecting market anticipation for the merger & acquisition news, said analysts at Jefferies India. “In the near-term, while both these stocks may remain afloat on deal newsflows, driving outperformance versus other large-cap peers, Ambuja's recent sharp up-move tilts our preference towards ACC,"" added the Jefferies report. But a bigger near-term positive could come in the form of improved ability to raise prices. Analysts at HDFC Securities Ltd note that the delays in the sell-off, owing to its mega-deal size, regulatory approvals, etc. could potentially derail the focus on ACC and Ambuja's planned expansions. ""This would be good news for the industry as a slower pace of capacity addition will reduce the demand-supply imbalance, supporting industry’s pricing power,"" said the domestic brokerage house in a report dated 18 April. That said, since market share loss has been an irritant for shareholders of ACC and Ambuja, the new buyer is expected to go full-throttle on fixing this. ""In the last decade, Holcim India has lost market share and an unlikely leeway under a new promoter. We see an emerging overhang of market disruption and risk of de-rating on leaders – Ultratech Cement and Shree Cement Ltd,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report on 18 April. According to media reports, Holcim is in early-stage negotiations with the Adani and JSW Group for this deal. Meanwhile, Holcim’s exit from its India cement business should be viewed in the backdrop of its strategy to reduce its carbon footprint by 2025. The company aims to cut its cement business to around 35% of revenue in calendar year 2025 from 55% in 2021. Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brazil are among the regions where Holcim has already off-loaded its stake in the cement business.    "

In the following quarter, Q1FY23, cement makers are expected to raise prices amid steep cost inflation, showed dealers channel checks by various brokerages. Higher realizations would help the sector prevent the erosion of operating margins. However, the eastern region is unlikely to see a meaningful increase in prices as it suffers from an acute demand-supply imbalance. Oversupply in this market against the backdrop of inadequate cement demand growth would weigh on prices, at least in the near term. If demand fails to absorb the supply, the region’s utilization can be expected to stay low. Of the total slated capacity additions of 27.5 million tonnes in FY23, 13.1 million tonnes is scheduled in east India alone, according to estimates of JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd.     "

Updated: 04 Mar 2022,Cement stocks under pressure as price hikes offer little solace,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/cement-stocks-under-pressure-as-price-hikes-offer-little-solace-11646369777074.html,"There is no light at the end of the tunnel for investors in cement stocks, at least for now. Shares of key cement manufacturers Ultratech Cement Ltd, ACC Ltd, Ambuja Cements Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd have dropped 12-8% in the last five trading sessions. This is despite dealers' channel checks indicating that price hikes have been taken in some regions. On a month-on-month basis, cement prices have risen by 4-5% in southern, western and eastern India, according to Jefferies India Pvt Ltd's report dated 3 March. On the other hand, the northern region saw a month-on-month price decline of 2%. Two crucial factors have not played out as per expectations of the Street. In a double whammy, costs are feared to rise futher and uptick in demand has not been as strong as previously anticipated. It should be noted that cement companies use crude-derived petroleum coke (petcoke) and imported coal as key inputs. Prices of these commodities were already elevated, but the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict could add to further upward pressure on supply constraints. ""There has been a substantial increase (up 75%/52%) in South African/Australian coal prices in the last one month (40-50% increase in two weeks),"" domestic brokerage house Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a report on 2 March. At present, imported coal prices are significantly higher than their peak in October 2021. For example, the South African coal price stood around $300/tonne versus its peak of $248/tonne. Petcoke prices too have started to rise, added the report. Analysts caution of peak margin pressures for cement companies in the June quarter of FY23. As far as demand growth is concerned, there is no cheer on that front as well. It should be noted that March quarter is seasonally strong for the sector and has historically seen meaningful uptick in construction activities. However, this time around demand so far in the quarter, has remained muted. ""Demand was weak in Feb'22 like Jan'22 - while dealers attribute to increasing costs of construction materials like steel/sand, companies attribute it to a high base,"" said the Jefferies report. Given the unimpresaive demand scenario, analysts at Jefferies see a risk to their estimate of Rs40 per bag increase in cement prices in Q4FY22. Needless to say, for cement companies the risk of earnings downgrades is getting more pronounced. ""Variable costs are expected to remain elevated in H1CY22 and may pose downside risks to our / consensus FY22-24E earnings in the absence of cumulative Rs45-50/bag price increase during H1CY22,"" analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd said in a report on 2 March."
Updated: 02 Mar 2022,Super 15: Stocks benefitting from rising popularity of ESG theme ,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/super-15-stock-benefitting-from-rising-popularity-of-esg-theme-11646195130371.html,"In a post-Covid world, conscious investing has gained lot of traction among investors. In fact, in 2021, at a global platform, India made a commitment to reach net carbon zero by 2070. With the environment, social and governance (ESG) theme fast catching-up, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd have outlined key considerations for investors and picked stocks from five sectors to bet on this theme. They are as follows: 1) Coal Sector: The fundamental question for India's transition is linked to its coal sector. Ensuring a well-planned and just transition away from coal will be a significant challenge, with both risks and opportunities in the power sector and beyond. With around 8% of state revenue from coal activities, diversification of the economy is needed. Coal India Ltd will be central to the transition. The company has already taken steps to diversify into renewable power, with three gigawatts of planned solar capacity to FY24. Natural gas is also set to play a significant role in displacing coal. GAIL India Ltd operates around 220 mmsmd (million metric standard cubic meter per day) of pipeline capacity and is the largest LNG trader in India. 2) Agriculture accounts for around 20% of India's greenhouse gas emissions and is the main source of non-carbon dioxide related emissions. Opportunities exist for investors through chemical free farming and low-cost solutions which improve irrigation and energy efficiency. UPL Ltd will likely play a central role in decarbonisation efforts. Through various projects, it is driving the adoption of digital solutions and increased penetration of bio-solutions. 3) Road Transport: With auto demand set to grow to 2040, an uptake in electric power-trains is an important area of focus for policy-makers. Tata Motors Ltd leads the local market with nearly 7% market share. Bajaj Auto Ltd, TVS Motor Company Ltd & Hero MotoCorp Ltd are actively expanding their electric vehicles portfolios. 4) Power Utilities: State-run distribution companies will underpin India's energy transition.

Shrinking operating margins were particularly a disappointment. As such, cement companies were unable to fully pass on the increase in power and fuel costs last quarter. “Ebitda/tonne on an aggregate basis has declined by ₹200-400 sequentially and year-on-year in the December quarter,"" said Mangesh Badhang, research analyst at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities.

According to stock market experts, cement shares are under pressure ahead of Ambuja Cement results as market is expecting weak Q3 numbers from the cement major. They said that market is trying to adjust with the new EPS (earning per share) and P/E ratio of the cement companies comparing with the P/E ratio and EPS of Ambuja Cement in the wake of weak Q3 results. They went on to add that major reason for weak Q3 results from cement major is rising input cost after surge in coal prices. Speaking on why cement prices are under pressure ahead of Ambuja Cement results for October to December 2021 quarter; Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities said, ""Cement shares are under selloff heat ahead of Ambuja Cement results announcement as market is expecting weak Q3 numbers from the cement major. Market expects that input cost of the cement companies have gone up in recent quarter after the rise in coal prices. So, input cost of the company would lead to rise in margins of the company, even when they manage to keep their revenue on the higher side."" On how weak Ambuja Cement results can impact other cement companies; Ravi Singhal, Vice Chairman at GCL Securities said, ""In the wake of weak Q3 earning of Ambuja Cement, market is adjusting the EPS and P/E ratio of Ambuja Cement shares. After adjusting Ambuja Cement shares P/E ratio and EPS, these indicators of other cement stocks have gone down and this is the reason for other cement stocks being under pressure ahead of Ambuja Cement results for Q3FY22."" Asked about stocks to buy from the cement segment in this falling cement stocks, Ravi Singhal of GCL said that cement companies are expected to report weak results in upcoming quarter as well because the rising coal prices are expected to fuel its input cost in near term. He advised positional investors to look at metal, banking and real estate stocks instead of cement stocks.

Akin to peers Ultratech Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd, ACC's sales volumes fell, while input cost rose. It should be noted that Ambuja Cements Ltd is yet to announce its December quarter earnings. ACC's sales volume was down 3% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 7.49 million tonne. The company follows a January-December accounting year. Ultratech and Shree Cement saw sales volume decline 3% y-o-y and 8.3% y-o-y in Q3FY22. High variable cost continued to hurt, leading to contraction in ACC's operating margin to 13.1% in 4QCY21 from 14.1% in Q3CY21. Hit by a surge in coal prices, power and fuel cost on a per tonne basis rose 27% year-on-year in Q4CY21. In a positive, however, due to its master supply agreement (MSA) with Ambuja, freight cost and raw material costs declined in Q4CY21 compared to Q4CY20. Understandably, ACC shares were muted on Thursday, trading flat on the National Stock Exchange, in reaction to the company's December quarter performance. Nonetheless, the stock’s performance in the last one year has been impressive. ACC shares have risen 31%, outperforming Ultratech’s 17% returns in the same span. Shree Cement stock price has declined 9% in the last one year. In the last five years, ACC shares have given lower returns than Ambuja, Ultratech and Shree. In the the last three years, ACC shares have risen by 66% compared to 110% surge in Ultratech and 80% jump in Ambuja shares. Analysts say the company’s expansion plans are on track and its cost rationalisation measures are yielding results and driving optimism towards the stock. “ACC’s volume improved during CY17-19 after remaining stagnant over CY11-16, which helped to arrest the market share loss seen during CY09-16. Going forward, we expect ACC to benefit from capacity expansions in Central India. Benefits from cost saving strategies (Project Parvat and MSA with Ambuja Cements) are expected to continue going forward,"" analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a report on 10 February. It should be noted that ACC’s 1.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) grinding capacity in Tikaria, Uttar Pradesh and an integrated plant with a clinker and grinding capacity of 2.7mtpa and 1mtpa, respectively in Ametha, Madhya Pradesh are expected to be commissioned by calendar year 2023. Meanwhile, on the valuation front, the ACC stock is trading at a one-year forward (FY23) EV/Ebitda of 9.34 times, showed Bloomberg data. EV is short for enterprise value. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Peers Ultratech and Shree Cement are trading at a higher valuation multiples of 16 times and 18 times, respectively. Analysts say, while the stock price is catching-up, bridging the valuation gap will be a gradual process for ACC."

Cement sales volumes fell by 8.3% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 6.55 million tonnes, impacted by the strike by transporters in markets such as Chhattisgarh. Cost inflation meant standalone earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) per tonne was the lowest in the past few quarters at ₹1,260. Higher sales of traded goods, where the company bought thermal coal globally and sold to its subsidiary in the UAE, also weighed on its costs. So, its total cost per tonne spiked to a multi-quarter high of ₹4,162.    "

Further, within various payment / withdrawal instruments, micro-ATM (mATM) deployment continues to outpace the growth in cards, PPIs and ATMs in FY22-TD. Even on a high base of 49% YoY growth in FY21, mATM deployment has risen by a strong 32% in FY22-TD, followed by prepaid cards at 27%. On the contrary, bank-led ATM network and card issuance (both debit & credit) grew in single digit at 1% / 4% respectively between Mar-Oct’21. In mATM space, Fino continues to dominate with 49% market share as of Nov’21, in total deployed devices. SBM Bank India (12% market share), City Union Bank (3%), NSDL Payment Bank (3%) and Yes Bank (4%) are aggressively tapping the mATM space during past 6-9 months.

Thereby offering fresh entry opportunity with favourable risk reward setup Key point to highlight is the stock has witnessed a slower pace of retracement as over past ten weeks it retraced 80% of preceding 4 weeks rally (| 1602-2598).

Consumer goods company Unilever Plc’s – that made three separate offers for GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK) consumer business – comes nearly two years after its Indian arm Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) successfully merged with GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Limited (GSKCH) in India, giving it access to health food drinks brands, such as Horlicks, Boost and Maltova in the country.

The pipeline infrastructure and expansions will take some time to complete while the bidding has been aggressive. There may be more upfront investments in terms of capex. All these are key factors to look out for, as per analysts. Also, since the geographical areas are relatively large, the company’s earnings can see upside of 4-5% but only over a period of time, said analysts.   ""With the Union Budget 2022 set to be announced, we expect the government to focus on investing in infrastructure that will allow for the total cost of logistics to reduce for the end customer. With some sections of the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor already operational, we look forward for the entire corridor to be completed connecting NCR and major maritime ports viz., Mundra, Piapavav and Nhava Sheva this year and continue its focus on improving infrastructure by prioritising other corridors like the North-South, East-West as well as the East-South and West South for uninterrupted rail movement of freight trains to facilitate domestic cargo movement. This will enable the logistics industry to keep moving ahead. In addition, there should be investments made towards digitization of supply chain management with a focus on new technologies like IoT. With the third pandemic wave and uncertain times ahead, the industry is expecting policy support and tax relaxations that will help boost ease of doing business for the industry. The logistics cost in India is around 5 percent more than the global average which leads to a huge competitive gap.

The earnings session kicked off with major IT names with mixed to positive notes and next week also going to be an important week in terms of earnings where we will react to HDFC bank's numbers on Monday while Ultratech Cement, Bajaj Auto, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finserv and HUL will come out with their earnings during next week.  The pre-budget move has started in many pockets and that is likely to continue in next week as well. Global markets are showing some volatility that will have some impact on our market as well. Covid cases are rising but the market is complacent about Covid cases as the hospitalization and mortality rate is low. The market is likely to remain volatile ahead of new all-time high amid Q3 earnings, global cues, and pre budget expectations. If we look at the trend of last three years then market starts to correct between 15-20th January then we see a big post-budget rally in the market. It will be interesting to see how the market will approach Budget 2022. If we look at the data then FIIs' long exposure in the index future stands at 66% while the put-call ratio is sitting at 1.25 level that is neutral to positive for the market. OI distribution is showing the highest OI at 18000 strike call option while 18200/18000 put strike prices are having the highest open interest and may act as immediate support levels. Technically, the market is in strong bullish momentum where 18300-18350 is a minor resistance area; above this Nifty is likely to head towards a fresh all-time high. On the downside, 18050-17950 is an immediate demand zone while 17800/17650 is major support levels. Bank Nifty is facing some resistance at 61.8% retracement of the previous fall from the high of 41829 to the low of 34018 however overall structure is bullish and if it manages to take out 38900-39100 resistance zone then we can expect a rally towards 40000/40500 levels. On the downside, 38000 is an immediate support level while 37500/37000 is the next support levels. (Santosh Meena is head of research at Swastika Investmart Ltd.)"
Updated: 10 Dec 2021,Ambuja Cement vs UltraTech Cement: Which is Better?,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ambuja-cement-vs-ultratech-cement-which-is-better-11639113023679.html,"India is the second largest producer of cement in the world. Availability of raw materials like limestone and coal make India a desirable destination for cement production. That is why many international firms such as Holcim Group and Heidelberg Cement, have invested in the Indian cement industry. According to the India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF) report, India has more than 7% of the world’s installed cement capacity. Ambuja Cement and UltraTech Cement are two of the well-known players in this industry. In this article, we compare these two companies based on their operational efficiency, profitability, and their future growth prospects. Business Overview Ambuja Cement is a part of the Holcim Group (formerly known as LafargeHolcim), a global leader in providing green building solutions in 70 markets across five continents.

Updated: 01 Nov 2021,The race for ‘most valued listed Indian cement stock’ gets intense,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/the-race-for-most-valued-listed-indian-cement-stock-gets-intense-11635750150961.html,"The valuation gap between Shree Cement Ltd and UltraTech Cement Ltd has continued to narrow. With that, the race for India’s most expensive listed Indian cement stock is getting exciting. At a one-year forward EV/Ebitda of around 20 times, Shree Cement has managed to maintain the top spot, at least for now. EV is short for enterprise value. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.  UltraTech Cement is trading at a valuation multiple of around 17 times, shows Bloomberg data.  But with September quarter earnings a mixed bag and competitor UltraTech's slew of cost-rationalisation measures, Shree Cement’s tag of most valued listed Indian cement stock is at a greater risk. In the September quarter, Shree Cement’s volumes declined 3.3% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 6.32 million tonne given its higher exposure to eastern India, which is facing a situation of over-supply. On the volume growth front, peers have performed better in the September quarter. Analysts note that Shree Cement’s volumes are lower than industry average, suggesting a marginal reduction in market share for the company. However, a miss on volume was offset by higher blended realisation. Also, a one-time push to operating profit came from that sale of power in the spot market, which contained the decline in Ebitda to 11% y-o-y. Analysts note that Shree Cement maintained a meaningful differential in Ebitda margins over its peers (Ambuja and UltraTech) on back of higher share of cheaper renewable power, indirect tax incentives and logistics advantage.  ""But the gap has contracted significantly over the last one year due to optimisation of realisations and extensive work on rationalisation of freight cost done by the peers. We believe that gap would further narrow down with a multi-fold increase in share of renewable power and further reduction in lead distance coupled with commissioning of new plants,"" analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd said in a report. Apart from its cost leadership, Shree Cement’s net cash position is also among the key factors supporting its premium valuations. But even there, Ultratech is fast catching-up; it is on a debt-reduction spree and continues to strengthen its balance sheet. UltraTech’s net debt increased by 6% sequentially, but declined 47% y-o-y to ₹6,300 crore as of September 2021. Net debt/Ebitda remained stable at 0.5times as of 2QFY22 from 1.3 times in 2QFY21.  ""With strong operational cash flows, we estimate 4-6% free cash flow yield in FY2021-24E despite growth capex and to help Ultratech become net cash positive in FY2022E,"" said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. And these factors have started to reflect in their valuations. Analysts at IDBI Capital Pvt Ltd highlight that Shree Cement’s valuation premium to UltraTech is at 45% compared to the highs at 80% and historical average of 40%. Meanwhile, Shree Cement has guided to increase its capacity to 80mtpa from 46.4mtpa by 2030. Mtpa is short for million tonnes per annum. Investors should note that, contrary to its earlier policy of focusing on organic expansion, Shree Cement is actively exploring inorganic opportunities to meet the targeted capacity. On the other hand, in the case of UltraTech, analysts at Kotak point out that the company in the past added leverage for inorganic growth, but given that there is no major cement asset on the block, merger & acquisition is not a likely risk."
Updated: 27 Oct 2021,Ambuja Cements feels the heat of cost inflation more than peers,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/ambuja-cements-feels-the-heat-of-cost-inflation-more-than-peers-11635312849647.html,"The September quarter earnings performance of Ambuja Cements Ltd was marred by a spike in operating expenses as fuel and freight costs remain elevated.  On a per tonne basis, blended cost increased by 9% sequentially and 7% year-on-year to ₹4,087 in Q3CY21. Analysts note that this is higher than expectations of a 3-4% rise in operating costs. Ambuja follows the calendar year as a financial year.  Variable cost of production rose more than 10% both sequentially and annually. Higher advertising spends, packaging cost, and travel expenses translated into increased other expenses. Analysts also point out that since the company has only one-month of inventory days, so impact of spot cost of fuel is much more for Ambuja than peers “Mirroring the sector trend, Ambuja witnessed cost headwinds, particularly in power & fuel and freight expenses. This led to a miss on Ebitda despite in line volume and unit realisation. Unit margins were down to Rs1,130/tonne. Despite the seasonal weakness, price decline was limited on account of improved revenue share of value-added products,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd said in a report. Volumes grew 9% YoY, with a small contribution of additional clinker sales. Consequently, standalone operating margins fell steeply from 28.5% in the June quarter to 21.7% in the September quarter. There was some respite from better-than-expected growth in cement realisations, which partially offset the impact of higher operating expenses.  Analysts note that the company’s realisations benefited from the change in market mix which was now in favour of better-priced markets of North & Central and lower sales in the east market, which is dealing with an oversupply situation. So, on a sequential basis, decline in realisation for Ambuja was lower than that of ACC Ltd and Ultratech Cement Ltd. The company’s sales mix of 40-45% in the North & Central regions inched up to near 50% during the quarter, while the East mix dipped from 25% to 20%. As far as the West & South sales mix is concerned, it was stable at 30%. Yet, in the backdrop of the Q3 performance, a slew of brokerage firms have trimmed the company’s operating growth estimates for calendar year 2022 and 2023. Meanwhile, during the September quarter, Ambuja started commercial production at its integrated plant at Marwar (Rajasthan) with clinker capacity of 3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) and cement capacity of 1.8mtpa.  “Going forward, incremental efficiencies and peaking utilisation may offset the cost inflation to some extent. But we remain wary of lower growth in the medium term due to capacity constraints. Near term growth will be managed by commissioning of the Marwar Mundwa project. While, the management has alluded to their plans of increasing the capacity to 50mtpa, execution will be the key,"" analysts at JM Financial Institutional Equities said in a report."

Even industry leader UltraTech Cement Ltd is feeling the heat. In the September quarter, UltraTech’s operating margin fell 340 basis points (bps) year-on-year (y-o-y) to 22.6% due to energy cost inflation. In a post-earnings conference call, the management said raw material costs rose due to higher slag and gypsum prices. Given the continuous rise in thermal coal prices, the firm has increased its dependence on petroleum coke (petcoke). The composition of petcoke in its fuel mix has risen from 17% in Q1FY22 to 19% in Q2FY22. Yet, the management expects a cost headwind of ₹200/tonne in Q3FY22 from higher fuel prices. The management expects another ₹500/tonne jump in fuel cost in the coming quarters due to higher spot coal prices; however, they see the current surge as transient. Freight costs are also expected to rise due to increased diesel prices.          "

Shares of Bajaj Finserv were trading around ₹13,974 with market cap standing at ₹2.21 trillion, which was more than that of Axis Bank's ₹2.19 trillion mcap. So far this year, Bajaj Finserv has outperformed the market by gaining 56% as compared to 9% rise in the benchmark Sensex. Axis Bank rose 15% in the same period. Currently, Bajaj Finserv stands at 18 positions in the overall market cap ranking, surpassing Maruti Suzuki India, Ultratech Cement and Nestle India. Bajaj Finserv (BJFIN) saw a muted performance due to the severe impact of the second lockdown on NBFC and higher reinsurance ceded in the insurance business in Q1FY22. The NBFC is expected to recover with normalcy in economic activities and ihas also undertaken technological initiatives that augur well for the next stage of growth. Strong premium growth and a better product mix will help life and general insurance companies generate higher revenue. Covid-related claims will continue to be a concern for the next few quarters, analysts say. Underlying metrics, however, remain steady with better exit month collections and sustained improvement; growth in preferred general insurance segments; and strong growth in the new individual life insurance business, despite lockdowns, Edelweiss Securities said in a note to its investors. ""While we, structurally, like most pieces of the story (life insurance clearly the least though), strong price action has rendered valuations rather full. Moreover, we are not altering our individual target multiples. Growth resumption/asset quality trajectory at Bajaj Finserv will drive stock performance"", Edelweiss Securities added. Axis Bank reported a slight miss on profit at ₹2,160 crore (versus analyst estimates of ₹2,290 crore) in the June quarter due to subdued margins and higher opex/provisions. Higher-than-expected gross slippages (84% retail) led to a 15bps rise in GNPA to 3.85%.

But analysts say the company’s shares factor in these positives. “Ambuja’s Q2 performance was good, but its margins are likely to compress in the second half. The stock’s recent outperformance prices in cost-efficiency benefits,"" Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a report. Besides, there are concerns about the company’s long-term growth prospects. Ambuja’s long-pending and delayed expansion in Rajasthan is likely to be completed in the next quarter. Analysts say that despite this, capacity constraints would remain a problem. “The capacity expansion in Rajasthan, which is happening after a long time, is not enough to sustain higher-than-industry volume growth or regain lost market share,"" said Nirmal Bang Securities Ltd analysts. Due to the lack of capacity growth, Ambuja has lost 250 basis points volume market share at an all-India level in the past 10 years, said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. Its market share currently stands at 7%, they add. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Ambuja Cement’s management recently announced its intent to boost capacity to 50 million tonnes per annum, but further details are awaited. Meanwhile, on a one-year forward EV/Ebitda basis, the Ambuja Cement stock is trading a multiple of 11 times, shows Bloomberg data. EV is short for enterprise value. This is lower than Shree Cement and UltraTech’s valuation multiples of 22 times and 18 times, respectively. Since the utilization of cash on the balance sheet is not directed towards growth, Ambuja has to do more to command a better valuation, Nirmal Bang’s analysts say."

Updated: 23 Jul 2021,UltraTech closer to being net-debt free due to stellar Jun qtr earnings,https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/ultratechs-stellar-june-quarter-earnings-come-as-a-boost-to-its-stock-11626950274865.html,"Better-than-expected realizations and tight cost curbs aided the earnings performance of UltraTech Cement Ltd in a quarter marred by covid-led curbs. The pan-India focused cement maker saw realizations hit a multi-quarter high in an otherwise seasonally weak quarter because of firm cement prices. On a per tonne basis, its average realization stood at ₹5,157 in Q1FY22, up by around 7% sequentially. Operating costs remained elevated during the quarter mainly because of higher freight expenses. However, input costs per tonne declined sequentially, because of UltraTech’s fuel mix strategy and increasing dependence on green energy. Consequently, Ebitda/tonne improved to ₹1,536 in Q1FY22 from ₹1,416 in Q1FY21 and ₹1,328 in Q4FY21. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. However, for investors in this stock, UltraTech’s debt reduction spree is more comforting as the company aims to become net-debt free by FY23. Its net debt reduced further by ₹733 crore in Q1FY22.  In a post-earnings conference call, the management said that covid impacted cash flows in Q1 and there was an increase in working capital requirements of ₹600-700 crore. Working capital increases in Q1 because of inventory built up for monsoons and then reduces gradually, the management explained. The management expects cash flow trajectory to remain strong. UltraTech has prepaid long-term loans of ₹5,000 crore this month and its net debt-to-Ebitda is now less than 0.5 times, it added. “UltraTech’s operating cash flow generation has been quite healthy in recent years, mainly supported by steady realization and cost deflation, which have enabled the firm to deleverage its balance sheet meaningfully. Therefore, we expect its net debt-to-Ebitda to reach 0.27 times in FY22 and -0.21 times in FY23,"" said Binod Modi, head of strategy at Reliance Securities Ltd. Achieving a debt-free status is expected to give UltraTech’s valuations a boost and bridge the gap with its peer Shree Cement Ltd. The latter is debt-free and the most expensive listed Indian cement stock. On a one-year forward enterprise value/Ebitda basis, the former is trading at a valuation multiple of 13 times and the latter at 16 times, according to Bloomberg data. “UltraTech’s volume growth is expected to beat the industry because of its huge capacity addition and the upward movement in the stock factors in this positive. We feel the next trigger for the stock would come from the trajectory of cash flows and timely achievement of its debt reduction target,"" said an analyst with a domestic brokerage house requesting anonymity."
