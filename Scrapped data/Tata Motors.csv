The tie-up will help Tata Motors tide over the global auto chips crunch that has affected its earnings and resulted in production cuts and even temporary plant shutdowns. Designing chips in collaboration with Renesas will come in handy for the current and newer electric cars to be made by Jaguar Land Rover. Electric cars are the future of the auto industry. Tata Motors, which sold 19,105 electric cars last year, a more than a four-fold jump from the 4,218 in the year ended March 2021, has doubled down on its investments in the segment. Tata Motors had a market cap of $17.5 billion as of 29 June; the electric car division managed to raise $1 billion from TPG, the private equity group, at a $9.1 billion valuation in October last year. As car makers across the world look to make electric cars, computing power has emerged as the new horsepower. More microchips, such as the ones Renesas makes, are getting embedded in cars. These microcomputers control varied functions from fuel injections to running infotainment systems and acting as the car’s brain for cruise control.        "

The planned innovation center will focus on comprehensive system solutions for the IoT, Infrastructure, Industrial and Automotive segments by leveraging Renesas’ semiconductor solutions and TCS’ industry experience.India is among the countries racing to subsidise domestic construction of factories that turn out semiconductors and displays in an effort to minimise supply risks. Its plan for $10 billion in incentives has lured applications from firms such as a joint venture between domestic conglomerate Vedanta and Taiwan's Foxconn, and Singapore's IGSS Ventures. Oil-to-metals giant Vedanta plans to invest $20 billion for two units for chip and display manufacturing while jeweller Rajesh Exports will invest $3 billion in an electronic display plant.

A clip on social media platforms has gone viral showing one of the firm's electric cars engulfed in flames. The video showed firefighters trying to extinguish the fire in a Nexon electric vehicle (EV) in a suburb of the Maharashtra capital. According to reports, the government's Defence Research and Development Organisation would lead the probe. Responding to the incident that has been widely shared on social media, Tata Motors in a statement said, ""A detailed investigation is currently being conducted to ascertain the facts of the recent isolated thermal incident that is doing the rounds on social media."" The firm said this was the first such incident, having sold more than 30,000 EVs, the bulk of which are its Nexon model. A spate of e-scooter fires resulting in death and causing severe injuries to people have triggered an investigation by the government. Initial findings of the federal probe into three e-scooter makers, including SoftBank-backed Ola Electric, found faulty battery cells and modules to be the leading cause of fires. An expert committee set up by the road transport ministry to investigate cases of electric two-wheelers catching fire and suggest remedial measures will submit its report this month. ""The expert committee (formed on battery standards and certification) is likely to submit it's report this month,"" an official said. Electrification is the cornerstone of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's climate change and carbon reduction agenda. EVs are also seen as a way to help the country to cut its oil import bill and reduce pollution in major cities. India wants electric models to make up 30% of total passenger car sales in the country by 2030, up from about 1% today, and e-scooters and e-bikes to account for 80% of total two-wheeler sales, up from about 2%."

This is the second time in the last six months that Tata Motors has pipped Hyundai to grab the coveted number 2 spot in the Indian PV market. However, Tata Motors has been steadily inching closer to bridge the gap it has with Hyundai with regard to market share, on the back of a steady ramp up in production of both its sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and electric vehicles (EVs). “Monthly numbers or one or two months of sales here and there don’t define Hyundai.

""JLR has brought down break-even level by ~50%; this augurs well for profitability as volumes normalise. Although management’s target of double-digit Ebit margin by FY26 looks ambitious, it cannot be ruled out. JLR has seen build-up of strong order-book with good response to recent launches and high expectations from the upcoming RR Sport. This should translate into higher volumes/earnings in FY23/FY24, as production ramps up,"" the note stated. The company's management has reiterated its target of reaching near-zero net debt by FY24 and analysts at IIFL believe this is achievable if production level normalises quickly. The brokerage has Buy rating on Tata Motors shares with a 12-month target price of ₹515, implying a potential upside of over 32% from current stock level. In address to shareholders in the company's annual report for 2021-22, its Chairman N Chandrasekaran said the company's three independent business units, commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover, are self-sustaining and the automaker is confident that it would get to near zero net automotive debt by FY24. JLR has brought down break-even level by around 50%, by improving contribution margins (cutting out low-margin models) and lowering fixed costs. Further, management reiterated its target of attaining 60% sales contribution from BEVs by 2030. JLR targets transforming Jaguar into a pure electric brand by 2025. The company plans to launch its first Land Rover BEV in 2024 and six Land Rover BEV models by 2026. “JLR’s focus on profitability over volumes meant that JLR has been less inclined to push low-priced models with discounts and marketing costs.

In his address to shareholders in the company's annual report for 2021-22, he said the company's three independent business units  -- commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover -- are self-sustaining and the automaker is confident that it would get to near zero net automotive debt by FY24. ""Recent history has been relentless with the global pandemic, military conflict, growing inequality, supply chain shortages and more. Decades of experience has been squeezed into two dizzying years. Businesses have had to cope with this unprecedented sequence of events with speed and agility,"" Chandrasekaran wrote. He pointed out supply chain issues and runaway commodity inflation as major hurdles among the multiple challenges faced. ""While the near-term outlook is fluid with multiple challenges that I outlined above, the business is taking the right actions to navigate them, and I am confident that we will emerge stronger,"" the Chairman added. Asserting that Tata Motors is ""taking concerted actions to be future ready and create a virtuous cycle of growth and returns for our shareholders"", he said, ""I would like to welcome you on this journey."" Despite margins being impacted by supply chain issues and runaway commodity inflation, he said, ""Our India business ended with strong free cash flows of ₹1,879 crore. We are committed to restoring the profitability of this business as it returns to competitive growth and inflation stabilises."" With Tata Motors Group now operating as three independent business units of commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover, he said it has offered differentiated value propositions to their different customer segments whilst leveraging backend and corporate synergies wherever possible. ""This has made Tata Motors lean, nimble and customer centric. Each of these businesses are self-sustaining, which gives me the confidence that we will get to near zero net automotive debt by FY24,"" Chandrasekaran said. Looking beyond the near-term challenges, he said, ""Jaguar Land Rover is in a strong position with a portfolio of attractive premium luxury products, a healthy customer order bank, low break-evens, and the right future ready strategy to support its distinctive and renowned British brands in a rapidly changing legislative and commercial landscape."" Chandrasekaran noted that the global shortage of semiconductors had a disproportionately adverse impact on JLR's production and sales compared to its competitors. ""Even though we took various steps to address the issue, the situation continues to remain challenging. This is a key issue facing Jaguar Land Rover and we are working assiduously to address the same during FY23. This should aid a gradual recovery in performance through the year,"" he stated. On JLR outlook, Tata Motors said while the COVID-19 lockdowns in China as well as the new Range Rover Sport model changeover are expected to limit volume improvements in Q1 of FY23, the company expects volumes to improve progressively thereafter, and ""we target to achieve a 5 per cent EBIT margin and (over) 1 billion pound positive free cash flow in FY23."" On the passenger vehicles business outlook, the homegrown auto major said the vertical is expected to deliver strong improvement in margins and profitability in FY23 and the company will continue to drive strong sales performance whilst improving profitability and managing supply bottlenecks. The PV business will continue to step-up new product launches and enhance capacities to cater to increasing demand, it said, adding that despite significant step-up in investments, the business is expected to remain self-sustaining. As for commercial vehicles (CV), Tata Motors said the industry is poised for further growth on the back of increased activity in road construction, mining and improved infrastructure spending. The supply situation continues to show gradual improvement. Despite uncertainties, business sentiments continue to be positive with increasing fleet utilisation levels and freight rates, it added. However, sharp commodity inflation continues to remain a challenge. The company said it will continue to step-up its investments in products and new business models to deliver customer value while ensuring profitable growth. ""Despite near-term supply challenges and inflation concerns, the business aims to deliver strong margins recovery and profitability in FY23,"" it added. Tata Motors Executive Director Girish Wagh said in FY22, unprecedented commodity inflation impacted the CV business margins and the company responded to the challenge by accelerating and intensifying cost reduction efforts, reviewing every cost element and taking pricing actions, towards profitability improvement. Improving profitability is an important priority. Reiterating Tata Motor Group's commitment to sustainable mobility, Chandrasekaran noted that the shift is irreversible and the company will be amongst the leaders of green mobility globally as it targets net-zero emissions by 2039 for JLR, 2040 for PVs and 2045 for CVs. ""Actions are already underway to deliver the same,"" he informed the company members. In India, EV penetration in the company's portfolio is likely to increase further to 25 per cent in five years from 7.4 per cent as of Q4 of FY22, Chandrasekaran said. By 2025, Tata Motors will have 10 EVs, he added. This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text. Only the headline has been changed."
Updated: 12 Jun 2022,Maruti’s segment focus shift could upend India’s auto market,https://www.livemint.com/industry/retail/marutis-segment-focus-shift-could-upend-india-s-auto-market-11655020977605.html,"New Delhi: More than a decade ago, when Tata Motors unveiled its plans to build and launch a ‘people’s car’, the Nano, an affordable small car in India, it was a turning point in the ‘India Story’. It was clear that India’s new economic power would draw on the country’s demographic dividend, a fast-growing consumer market of not-so-rich Indians. The small car was a winner – delivering volumes to the manufacturer and serving consumers just what they wanted. The reigning automotive market leader, Maruti Suzuki, had established its dominance through a proliferation of small, affordable cars starting with the Maruti 800, the Zen, the Alto, the WagonR and several others over decades. Analysts predicted that the market could only grow, and India’s position as a ‘small car country’ would endure. Just fourteen years later, the trend has shifted sharply, with the SUV, or the sports utility vehicle, becoming the car of choice across consumer classes and geographies and manufacturers for whom they represent a juicy slice of market share and business growth. Indeed, SUVs are the fastest-growing segment of the passenger vehicle industry. The biggest affirmation for the big shift has come from Maruti Suzuki. The Economic Times has reported that the undisputed leader of the industry has set its eyes on the top spot for SUVs, a segment where it isn’t even in the reckoning for the second position at the moment. Maruti commands a market share of nearly half to 97% in all the rest of the passenger vehicle segments. In SUVs, its market share is a low 12% but Maruti has set itself a target for growing this and aim for pole position in the SUV race over the next 12 to 18 months. The company’s premium car models include Ciaz and SUVs such as the A-Cross and the XL-6, all sold through its premium Nexa dealerships. (As against the Alto, Swift, Dzire and other cars, as well as also the SUV, Brezza, that are sold through mainstream dealerships called Arena.) Plans are afoot for new SUV launches from the Maruti stable. These may include the Jimny, the Baleno Crossover and a new Brezza, according to The Economic Times report. The launches are to deliver as many as a quarter of a million units of fresh sales per year to help Maruti double its market share. Component suppliers and dealers are already prepping to handle the volumes, reportedly. What does the big shift in Maruti’s strategy mean for rivals like Hyundai, Kia, Tata Motors, and Mahindra & Mahindra? It is a wake-up call. Japanese corporations have a reputation for manufacturing and for the ability to turn adversity into an advantage. Maruti, the presumed sleeping giant, when awakened, can set off industry tremors with new models, and the depth, breadth and sweeping expanse of its dealer networks, and sales centres across the country. Maruti’s portfolio, even though designed to be economical, practical and low on cost of maintenance, has been built steadily over the years with 'inching-closer-to-premium' cars. Its Nexa-badged range of cars have designs and features usually seen in pricier vehicles. It’s inevitable that the industry is set for stiff competition. If that makes the cake larger, which is more than likely, it can only be good news for the entire industry. For if Maruti's past track record is any indicator, then its three new SUVs (and possibly many more on the way that hasn’t been announced yet) would boost market share, volumes, and revenue for the market leader and also trigger a new race amongst car-makers. A race for pushing out new SUV models catering to the complex and highly segmented demography of Indian car buyers. There are a few more years still before India goes from “small car-nation"" to “SUV-nation"" but that’s a question of when; not whether or not—this is what Maruti gearing up to shift its focus on the SUV segment shows."

Apart from Tata Motors Ltd (TML), the market regulator has cautioned Niskalp Infrastructure Services, formerly known as Niskalp Investment and Trading Ltd, to be cautious in its future dealings. The case relates to a backdated transaction in the shares of Global Telesystems Limited (now known as GTL Ltd) and Global E-Commerce Services Ltd, an unlisted company that merged with GTL in 2001. ""For the events that accrued more than eighteen years ago, any adverse orders passed against TML at this stage though legally will be valid but may not practically serve any purpose since TFL (Tata Finance), which brought the Rights Issue, has been merged with TML 17 years ago with effect from June 24, 2005, and is no longer in existence,"" Sebi Whole Time Member SK Mohanty said in his 54-page order. Further, the regulator noted that the present board of directors of TML is completely different from all the directors of TFL, who are all senior citizens and have long since retired from the board of TFL and Niskalp. ""In view of the aforesaid mitigating factors and the facts that substantial and positive remedial measures have been proactively taken by TML and Niskalp against the erring officials and the subscribers of the rights issue of TFL were given options twice to exit from the said Rights Issue by TFL if they wish to do so, the end of justice would be met if the Noticee nos 1 (TML) and 11 (Niskalp) are warned to be careful in their future dealings in the securities market,"" Sebi said. It was alleged that TFL concealed the true and correct facts from the investors and disseminated untrue and misleading statement of facts about the financials of Niskalp, which was one of the subsidiary companies of TFL, in the letter of offer of its rights issue. Further, to show the inflated and fictitious profit in the books of account of Niskalp, it was alleged that TFL has knowingly engaged in the acts of backdating the transactions of sale-purchase and accounting entries with respect to the scrip of GTL and GECS in the books of accounts of Niskalp and consequently in the offer document of the TFL, to give a better picture of the accounts of Niskalp in the 'letter of offer' of TFL to induce purchase/subscription to the rights issue of TFL by its shareholders. The order came after Sebi received a complaint in October 2002 from Tata Finance, alleging instances of irregular transactions in securities based on backdated and fictitious contract notes or bills, for the sale and purchase of shares of Global Telesystems Ltd and Global E-Commerce Services Ltd by DS Pendse and AL Shilotri, who executed the trades on behalf of Niskalp Investment and Trading Ltd (now known as Niskalp Infrastructure Services Ltd) and TFL, respectively. Following the complaint, Sebi conducted an investigation into the alleged backdated transactions in the shares of GTL and GECS to ascertain a possible violation of the provisions of the PFUTP (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) norms.

Updated: 08 Jun 2022,Bombay HC reserves order in BEST-Tata e-bus tender case,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/bombay-hc-reserves-order-in-best-tata-e-bus-tender-case-11654620573479.html,"MUMBAI : The Bombay High Court on Tuesday reserved its order on a petition filed by Tata Motors challenging the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport’s decision to disqualify it from the tendering process for operating electric buses in and around Mumbai. In a writ petition filed before the court, the auto major also alleged that BEST’s decision to award the contract for 2,100 e-buses to Hyderabad’s Evey Trans Pvt. Ltd reeked of favouritism and corruption. “The action of BEST undertaking an award of a huge contract of 2,100 electric buses in favour of Evey Trans is tainted with arbitrariness, discrimination, favouritism, corruption and collusion,"" said Abhishek Manu Singhvi, senior counsel appearing for Tata Motors. Singhvi alleged extraordinary circumstances led to the award of the contract, wherein the tender conditions were ignored and rules were deliberately bypassed to declare Evey Trans as the successful bidder. BEST invited bids for operating state carriage services of 1,400 single-decker air conditioned e-buses in Mumbai and its suburbs on a gross-cost contract model for 12 years. Subsequently, Tata Motors filed a technical and financial bid for the tender following a pre-bid meeting during which it requested BEST to amend certain parameters, which was agreed to. Meanwhile, BEST released the technical suitability evaluation, which Tata Motors claimed was incorrectly labelled as “technically non-responsive"". “Tata Motors drifted from conditions where it planned to submit the models after testing them under simulated settings using the Automotive Industry Standards measure,"" argued Venkatesh Dhond, the senior counsel for BEST, in his reply to the petition. However, Tata Motors said that it had requested a deviation from the relevant standards for testing the range of the buses, but without any explanation for rejecting its request, BEST disqualified it from the tendering process. When the high court asked BEST how it would assess if the bid is genuine and the declaration of operating range is correct, its counsel, Dhond, clarified that the assessment was based on the range specified by the bidders and the contract was not simply an order for the sale of buses, but also operating them and the onus was on the bidder to ensure it."

This was revealed by the Mahindra’s Executive Director, Rajesh Jejurikar, in a press event today. Mahindra XUV300 is already available in the ICE variant and now the electric unit will drive Mahindra’s sustainable mobility business competing with MG and Tata Motors. XUV300 is one of the fastest selling ICE SUVs for the brand other than XUV700 and Thar. Meanwhile, Mahindra has already planned to bring new models under its Born Electric umbrella. The Mumbai-based automaker is scheduled to launch its new electric cars in July 2022. These cars have been designed at Mahindra’s design studio in the UK. The electric XUV300 will be in the above 4 metre category, said Jejurikar. It means that the EV incentives could not be availed on this car. Various state and central government provide incentives on the purchase of electric vehicles which is defined by the size and other parameters. Mahindra has become quite vocal about the electric cars now and hope to replicate its SUV success in this sustainable segment as well. Mahindra recently tied up Volkswagen Group to work on the modular electric drive matrix. The company also aims to disrupt the dominance of Tata Motors in the sub-four metre EV category. Tata has Nexon and Tigor EVs to dominate this emerging market. Mahindra’s XUV range; both XUV300 and XUV700, has been the key driver for the brand’s record growth in the SUV segment. The XUV300 would be an additional option for the EV buyers coming from an Indian brand. Maruti Suzuki still has to make any official announcement into the EV space and till then we have two Indian brands, Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, making the most of it while competing with Hyundai and MG."

Nifty 50 index ended 89 points lower at 16,125 mark whereas BSE Sensex shed 236 points and closed at 54,052 levels. Nifty Bank index added 42 points and closed at 34,290 levels. Broad markets underperformed as the small-cap and mid-cap indices fell more than the 50-stock Nifty index. According to stock market experts, daily timeframe of Nifty indicates that index has made a double bottom around the 15,735 levels and rallied sharply last Friday. Nifty has however failed to convincingly cross the recent swing high of 16,400 and has corrected from those levels in the last two sessions. They said that many stocks are also correcting and failing to hold on to their recent gains. This is a sign of weakness and caution is therefore warranted. Traders should wait for strength to emerge before going aggressively long. Day trading guide for stock market today Speaking on intraday trading strategy, Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities said, ""While we remain open to further pullback rallies in the very near term, we must remember that the intermediate trend remains down. The bears would gain more control once the recent intermediate low of 15,735 is broken."" Advising traders to remain cautious, Ruchit Jain, Lead Research, 5paisa.com said, ""India VIX was up by 10 per cent on Tuesday, which is a sign of cautiousness and hence, traders should keep a tab on the same. The IT space continued its correction which validates our recent view on extension of the corrective phase in this sector. The Bank Nifty has shown relative strength in last couple of sessions but it has not yet surpassed its crucial hurdle. So in case the Nifty resumes its correction in the near term, then the banking space too will follow the path.""

This is the third phase of a joint MWp on-site solar project developed by the two companies. A 10 MWp has been previously installed. The two have also inked a power purchase agreement (PPA) for the project. The installation is expected to generate 23 million units of electicity, mitigating 5.23 lakh tonnes of carbon dioxide. It is equivalent to planting 8.36 lakh trees over a lifetime. “Tata Motors has been working towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions to achieve Net Zero Emission goal. With fresh agreement to install an additional Roof Top solar plant of 7 MWp in our Pune plant in association with Tata Power, we will move closer to our goal of 100% Renewable Energy. Post commissioning of this capacity, we will become the largest onsite solar installation in India,"" said Mr. Rajesh Khatri, Vice President, Operations, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd. Tata Motors generated 92.39 million kWh of renewable electricity in FY22, accounting for almost 19.4% of total power usage. The company plans to focus on sourcing renewable energy to reach its goal of having 100% renewable energy by 2030. “India’s largest on-site solar project at Tata Motors‘ Pune plant is a testament to our shared goal of being green in our businesses. The project reinforces Tata Power’s position as one of India’s top renewable energy players, offering considerable value to its partners through its project execution capabilities and technical expertise,"" said Mr. Gurinder Singh Sandhu, Chief – New Business Services, Tata Power. Tata Power has one of the world’s largest rooftop (16MW) at a single location at Radhasoami Satsang Beas (RSSB), Amritsar; 2.67MW at Cochin International Airport; one of the world’s largest solar-powered cricket stadium-Cricket Club of India (CCI) with 820.8 kWp capacity; unique installation of the solar vertical farm (120kW) at Dell Technologies at Bangalore and 1.4MW floating solar at Tata Chemicals, Nellore. In addition, Tata Power is carrying out an extensive pan-India residential rooftop program to make people aware of the benefits of savings through solar energy."
Updated: 23 May 2022,Mahindra to explore partnerships for electric vehicle parts,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/mahindra-to-explore-partnerships-for-electric-vehicle-parts-11653298101524.html,"Auto-giant Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is looking to strengthen its electric vehicles (EVs) portfolio and the company will be exploring partnerships for sourcing more components from other companies. On Monday, M&M shares traded on a bullish note. Anish Shah, chief executive and managing director of Mahindra told Reuters that the company had over time focussed on developing EV components in-house but now changed tack to forge partnerships to achieve faster growth in the segment. Last week, Mahindra signed an agreement with Volkswagen to explore the use of MEB electric components for Mahindra’s new “Born Electric Platform"". Both the companies will be evaluating the scope of collaboration. In a statement, Mahindra announced its plan to equip its “Born Electric Platform"" with MEB electric components such as electric motors, battery system components, and battery cells. On the deal with the German motor vehicle manufacturer, Shah said that it's Volkswagen at this stage, and ""as we see similar strengths in other areas, we are open to looking at various components that we would bring in, and do what we are very good at in-house as well."" Notably, Mahindra will face fierce competition from Tata Motors which currently dominates the electric vehicles market in the country. Last week, Tata raised about $1 billion from TPG for the business. Further, another player China's SAIC Motor-led MG Motor India is also looking to raise funds for developing its EV business. Mahindra's chief said that they will use ""significant funds"" for EVs and have them available. He added, ""We always will be open to value creation opportunities."" As India aims to meet its climate change and carbon reduction goals, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced companies billions of dollars as incentives to develop and strengthen their EV business. It needs to be noted that, Mahindra has a developed EV portfolio in the commercial vehicles segment, but now the company aims to push EVs in the passenger cars segment and more particularly sports utility vehicles (SUVs). Shah said, ""Our strike zone has been authentic SUVs, that's where we are going to stay ... we are not going to make EV sedans, no hatchbacks."" At the World Economic Forum summit at Davos, Shah in an interview said that the ""world is moving towards a lot more partnerships. It's better to source the best that's out there, rather than do everything ourselves."" On BSE, Mahindra shares are trading at ₹941 apiece up by ₹36.40 or 4.02% at around 3.13 pm. The shares are near the day's high of ₹943.40 apiece."

Updated: 18 May 2022,Premium PV sales grow faster than lower cars,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/premium-pv-sales-grow-faster-than-lower-cars-11652894290363.html,"NEW DELHI : Cars priced above ₹10 lakh sold significantly more than those in lower-priced segments in FY22, as the wedge between income sentiments widened in the aftermath of the covid-19 pandemic. An analysis by ratings agency Crisil showed that FY22 sales of cars priced above ₹10 lakh, or the so-called premium segment consisting mostly of utility vehicles (UVs), grew 38% from the previous year, whereas cars priced lower grew at a modest 7% during the same period. This trend points towards a sharp shift in customer preference towards premium vehicle offerings, a trend in the making for quite some time, but hastened by covid-19. Premium cars now make up 30% of the total automotive market compared to 25% in FY21, the Crisil analysis showed. “Key reasons for this shift were a stark difference in income sentiment of the respective target consumers, a sharper rise in the prices of lower-end cars, fewer options (some manufacturers exited the segment), and a slew of new launches that have increased the preference for higher-priced cars,"" Pushan Sharma, director, Crisil, said. First-time buyers are also increasingly looking to buy a bigger pre-owned car that fit their budgets, than a new small car, it said. There is also a tendency among buyers to prefer new models in the SUV body style to a well-established hatch, the report added. To be sure, car prices have also gone up in tandem with rising inflation. “ There has been a 15-20% cumulative increase in the sticker price of lower-end cars over the past four fiscals due to increased stringency of safety regulations and the transition to BS-VI norms,"" said Sharma in the report. “A car is a discretionary purchase, and negative sentiments have a disproportionate effect on the car-buying decision"", Shashank Srivastava, executive director, Maruti Suzuki, told Mint in a recent interview. “Of course, the design sentiments of the Indian customers have shown a preference for SUVs that have good road presence, high ground clearance, and good stance. Entry-level SUVs overlap with premium hatch and entry-level sedans and, hence, cost- wise also, preferred by Indian customers,"" Srivastava said. The trend holds for the two-wheeler market as well. “Over the past 5-6 fiscals, two-wheelers priced over ₹70,000 have consistently sold more than those that cost less. The reasons for this are a 40- 45% increase in the cost of ownership and a 50-55% increase in the cost of acquisition since fiscal 2015. The cost of ownership has risen significantly because of tighter regulatory norms and price hikes by vehicle makers to offset higher input costs. This has materially dampened consumer sentiment and offtake of lower-priced two-wheelers,"" Sharma said. “There is a structural issue when it comes to two-wheeler and three-wheeler demand. Economic recovery is not evenly spread across lower income groups which constitutes most of our customers. 70% of customers earn less than ₹40,000 per month and 60-65% do not have an income proof. That is the type of customer we are talking about. And the continued underperformance of the two-wheeler segment demonstrates that this class of customers has been significantly weakened after covid-19,"" Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto, said in a post-Q4 earnings conference call."

Mint has seen a copy of the plea filed on May 10. The court will hear the matter on 23 May. Tata Motors has alleged that its technical bid was rejected on arbitrary grounds in favour of another bidder, Evey Trans Pvt Ltd. Tata Motors declined to comment on Mint's query saying the matter was sub-judice. The auto major had submitted its technical and financial bid for the tender on 25 April. BEST had invited bids for an order of 1,400 single-decker AC electric buses to be used for public transport. A bench comprising justices Nitin W. Sambre and Anil Laxman Pansare of the Bombay high court has directed BEST to submit a reply to the plea by Tata Motors. Tata Motors, represented by law firm Karanjawala & Co, has argued that its bid complies with the conditions of the tender and provides a guarantee of operating range of electric buses as 200 km for single decker buses, with 80% state of charge without any interruption."

There was some excitement about the March quarter (Q4FY22) margin performance of its UK-based subsidiary, Jaguar Land Rover Automation PLC. The Jaguar and Land Rover (JLR) segment earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin stood at 12.6%, an increase from the 12% in Q3. “Going into the results, investors feared JLR’s margin could come under pressure on lower sales of the high-margin Range Rover as the model goes for a changeover. Accordingly, the stock was weak in the recent few days. However, despite an inferior mix, JLR’s margin expanded sequentially, helped by exceptionally low discounts and higher scale,"" said Kumar Rakesh, a senior automobile and technology analyst at BNP Paribas Securities India. Tata Motors’ Q4 results were out on Thursday after market hours. The company’s shares have now pretty much recovered the losses seen last week prior to Friday’s gains. While the Russia-Ukraine war had a limited impact on JLR production, the business remains affected by the global semiconductor shortage. JLR’s wholesale volumes (excluding joint venture) fell by 37.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q4.      "

Further, analysts are optimistic about this Tata Group-led company on the back of a strong demand outlook, impressive margin, and free cash flow targets. On BSE, Tata Motors shares closed at ₹404.35 apiece up by 8.67%. The shares touched an intraday high of ₹415.75 apiece. Overall today, the shares have gained by at least 11.73%. On the previous day, Tata Motors shares stood at ₹372.10 apiece. In Q4FY22, Tata Motors posted a net loss of ₹1,033 crore for the quarter ending March 31, 2022 (Q4FY22) - steeply narrowing from a loss of ₹7,605 crore in the same period last year. Consolidated revenue dipped 11.5% yoy to ₹78,439 crore. EBITDA margin contracted by 320 basis points to 11.2% in the quarter. Despite the decline in the top-line front, Tata Motors narrowing in loss lifted market sentiments. Also, the company continued to show recovery in its commercial vehicles business clocking a revenue of ₹18,529 crore up by 29.3% yoy - highest ever quarterly revenues since Q4FY19. Further, the passenger business also delivered a comprehensive turnaround with revenue at ₹10,491 crore in Q4FY22 increasing by a whopping 62% yoy - highest ever quarterly revenues. Notably, electric volumes rose to 9.1K units in Q4, and PV market share improved to 13.4% (+440bps). Its luxury car firm, Jaguar Land Rover recorded revenue of £4.8 billion in Q4 FY22, up 1% from Q3 FY22, reflecting the higher wholesales offset partially by the impact of the runout of the previous generation Range Rover, with the New Range Rover still ramping up. The EBIT margin in the quarter was 2.0% with profit before tax about breakeven (£ 9 million) before a £ (43) million exceptional charge for their business in Russia. Free Cashflow improved to £340 million, up from £164 million in Q3. Tata Motors plans to become debt-free by FY24. Its free cash flow has shown signs of consistent improvement. In its outlook, Tata Motors said, ""the demand remains strong despite geopolitical and inflation concerns. The supply situation is gradually improving, whereas commodity inflation is likely to remain at elevated levels. We expect performance to improve through the year as the China COVID and semiconductor supplies improve and aim to deliver strong EBIT improvement and free cash flows in FY 23 to get to near net auto debt-free by FY 2024."" Tata Motors shares have the potential for further upside going ahead. One investor, in particular, will gain hefty with Tata Motors' stellar performance on stock exchanges. That would be none other than the 'Big bull of Dalal Street' Rakesh Jhunjhunwala! As of March 31, 2022, Jhunjhunwala holds 39,250,000 equity shares or 1.18% in Tata Motors. As per Trendlyne data, as of today, the ace investor's holding is valued at around ₹1,611 crore in the company.

Triggers to drive Tata Motors shares! Shashank Kanodia and Raghvendra Goyal, Research Analysts at ICICI Direct has given a 'Buy' recommendation on Tata Motors shares after Q4 earnings. The analysts set a target price of ₹500 apiece on this Tata automobile flagship. According to the duo, Tata Motors stock price has been flattish over the past five years (Rs430 levels in May 2017), underperforming the Nifty Auto index. They said, ""We retain BUY on positive demand outlook, impressive margin & FCF targets for FY23E and intent to be net debt-free (automotive) by FY24E."" In terms of target price and valuation, the analysts said, "" We now value TML at ₹500 on SOTP basis (10x, 3x FY24E EV/EBITDA on India, JLR; ₹160 value to Indian EV business; earlier TP ₹550)."" Further, these analysts highlighted four trigger points for future price performance in Tata Motors. These are: Firstly, ICICI Direct analysts expect a healthy 13.2% revenue CAGR over FY22-24E backed by 15.8% total volume CAGR amid a strong order book at JLR (1.68 lakh units). Secondly, cost control, efficiency improvement-led FCF generation targets for ongoing deleveraging push (FY22 net automotive debt at ₹48,700 crore). Thirdly, continued EV alertness in India through concepts & real launches (PV market leader with Nexon; plans to introduce 10 models by 2025) and JLR (Jaguar all-electric by 2025; 6 BEVs in Land Rover in next five years). Lastly, they said margin is seen at 14.3% in FY24E along with RoCE at ~13.7%. Compared to Thursday's stock price level with ICICI Direct's target price, Tata Motors has a potential for over a 34% rise in stock ahead."
Updated: 13 May 2022,Tata Motors’ shares ride high on Q4 margin surprise,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/tata-motors-shares-ride-high-on-q4-margin-surprise-11652423398513.html,"Shares of Tata Motors Ltd are up by more than 9% in Friday’s morning trade on NSE. This comes on the back of better-than-expected margin performance in its fourth quarter results (Q4FY22). The automaker reported Q4 consolidated Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin of 11.1%, which is a drop of 325 basis points (bps) year-on-year (y-o-y). One basis point is 0.01%. However, this was ahead of analysts’ estimates. For instance, analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services were expecting the measure to stand at 10.6%. Operating revenue fell by 11.5% to Rs78,439 crore. While revenue in the commercial vehicle (CV) and passenger vehicle (PV) business grew by 29% and 62%, respectively, Jaguar and Land Rover (JLR) business reported a decline in y-o-y revenue by 27%. JLR business was impacted by semiconductor shortage leading to a fall in wholesale volumes (excluding joint venture) by 38% y-o-y in Q4. But the management expects the chip situation to gradually improve going ahead and volumes in FY23 to surpass FY22, it said in the post earnings call. However, Q1FY23 is likely to be impacted owing to the lockdown in China and changeover in the model. Concerns with respect to elevated commodity costs are likely to sustain. But subsequent quarters are expected to recover and the management foresees achieving Ebit margin of 5% and more than GBP1 billion free cash flows. JLR’s order book stands at 168,000 units at the end of Q4 which is an increase from 155000 units in Q3FY22. Owing to this coupled with low channel inventory in system, analysts at ICICI Securities expect mix to normalize resulting in mean reversion of realization and gross margin as production improves. In the Indian business, the CV segment would benefit from further growth with increased infrastructure activity. The management said in the call that the increase in fuel prices did not impact demand as is evident from the good traction in May so far. The outlook for PV business is likely to remain strong and hence the company is boosting capital expenditure in the segment. Note that in FY22, PV volumes increased by 67% y-o-y and the market share improved to 12.1% from 8.2% in FY21. “As CV cycle turns (expect ~21% CAGR for industry over FY22-FY25E), Tata Motors (being the market leader in domestic CVs) is likely to benefit with improved margins,"" said ICICI Securities analysts in a report on 13 May. CAGR is compound annual growth rate. It also leads in electrification in the PV business with the highest market share. Even so, there are headwinds. “We cut our FY23/FY24 consolidated earnings per share estimate by 12% each to account for: a) a volume cut in JLR due to the lockdown in China and slower improvement in semiconductor supplies, b) cost inflation, and c) translation impact of the appreciation in the INR against the GBP on JLR consolidation,"" said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services in a report on 13 May."

With pick-up in FCF generation momentum in domestic business led by CV upcycle; strong turnaround in domestic PV business; and JLR confident of generating GBP1bn of FCF in FY23 despite lockdown challenges in 1Q, analysts at Ambit remain confident of Tata Motors turning near net debt free by FY24E. The brokerage has reiterated its Buy rating on the auto stock with SOTP-based target price of ₹551 ( ₹574 earlier). “JLR’s order book is strong at 168,000 units, while dealer inventories are low.

India's biggest lender State Bank of India (SBI) said on Friday its fourth-quarter profit rose 41% to a record 91.14 billion rupees ($1.18 billion) as it set aside less money to account for sour loans. Investors cheered the lower bad loan provisioning by state-run SBI, widely seen by investors as a bellwether for the broader lending industry. Shares rose as much as 3.1% to 477 rupees after SBI reported results. Most Indian lenders have reported healthy growth for the March quarter on back of an uptick in loan growth and improving asset quality, which has helped to keep provisions low. SBI set aside 32.62 billion rupees as a provision for loan losses, over two-third lower than 99.14 billion rupees in the same period last year, the bank said in a filing to exchanges on Friday. The bank saw its income from interest on loans grow 8.6% to 707.33 billion rupees during the quarter. Overall lending grew 11% during the quarter, driven by a strong 15.1% growth in retail loans.
