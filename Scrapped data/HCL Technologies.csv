Updated: 05 Jul 2022,IT services firms likely to report strong revenue in Q1,https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/it-services-firms-likely-to-report-strong-revenue-in-q1-11657042305039.html,"BENGALURU :   Top Indian IT services companies are expected to report strong revenue growth of 2.3-4.3% quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q) in constant currency during the fiscal first quarter ended June, according to analysts. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) will kick off the earnings season on Friday. However, the peak revenue growth of these companies is likely to be behind them and the momentum is expected to start softening from H2 FY23 due to absence of large deal wins and clients postponing their technology spends. While the long-term demand environment remains unaltered, elevated inflation and an economic slowdown in the US and Europe is likely to impede growth in the second half of the fiscal. “We anticipate Infosys to lead on organic revenue front with growth of 4.3% QoQ in constant currency, followed by TCS at 3.6% QoQ in constant currency. Growth in Tech Mahindra, Wipro and HCL Technologies is expected to be soft due to seasonal weakness and moderation in demand,"" ICICI Securities said in a pre-earnings note. Margins are likely to be under pressure due to wage hikes, higher backfilling costs, increase in travel/visa/other discretionary costs with the easing of travel restrictions, and back-to-office trends, said Emkay Research. “Due to cross-currency headwinds, benefits from rupee depreciation will be marginal in Q1."" The brokerage firm expects Infosys to retain its annual revenue growth guidance of 13-15% in constant currency and EBIT margin guidance of 21-23% for FY23. HCL Technologies is also likely to retain its 12-14% revenue growth and 18-20% EBIT margin guidance range. Wipro should guide for a 2.5-4.5% sequential growth in constant currency with Rizing adding about 1% incrementally for Q2 FY23. In the absence of large deal wins, smaller deals will drive deal intake in the June quarter. “ACV (annual contract value) of signed deals to remain strong. We expect the deal intake to remain healthy across companies in Q1, with an uptick in smaller deals (led by clients’ urgency to execute digital transformation deals quickly) driven by increased demand for cloud adoption, digital transformation and customer experience transformation deals,"" Emkay Research said."
Updated: 24 Jun 2022,IT firms bet on organic cloud platforms,https://www.livemint.com/industry/infotech/it-firms-bet-on-organic-cloud-platforms-11656014158470.html,"BENGALURU : Top software services companies like Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd are betting big on organic cloud platforms built in-house to help customers accelerate their cloud journeys. The shift to cloud has accelerated due to the pandemic. According to Gartner, by 2025, 51% of IT spending in the areas of application software, infrastructure software, business process services and system infrastructure markets is expected to shift to public cloud, compared to 41% in 2022. Traditional offerings, constituting 58.7% of revenue in 2022, should witness a much slower growth than cloud. “Surge in cloud adoption could prove to be a growth lever for IT service providers on the back of cloud platforms created by them to help speed up cloud transformation journey of clients, thereby improving the utilization of cloud capacity subscribed by clients, and thus, translating bookings into revenues for hyperscalers partners,"" analysts at ICICI Securities said. Infosys has developed an organic cloud platform known as Cobalt, comprising a set of services, solutions, and platforms to help clients, mostly large enterprises, build new cloud-first capabilities. It offers 14,000 cloud assets and over 200 industry cloud solution blueprints. Infosys has also created a Polycloud platform, which enables enterprises to procure, build, and manage vendor-agnostic solutions across multiple hybrid cloud providers without worrying about vendor lock-in. Similarly, TCS Enterprise Cloud is a cloud platform that provides a range of flexible cloud infrastructure options to support dynamic cloud services. It offers data services built on an open-source stack supporting big data, analytics, internet of things (IoT). Cloud Smart by HCL Technologies aims to “reimagine"" the cloud to provide an adaptive portfolio of innovative cloud services driven by high-tech automation and a robust partner ecosystem. Last year, Wipro committed to invest $1 billion to strengthen its cloud technologies, capabilities, acquisitions, and partnerships over the next three years. As part of this, it launched Wipro FullStride Cloud Services, which brings together the full portfolio of Wipro’s cloud-related capabilities, offerings, and talent."

Updated: 01 Jun 2022,Digital is gradually changing the nature of deals for IT companies,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/digital-is-gradually-changing-the-nature-of-deals-for-it-companies-11654026807652.html,"BENGALURU : As software services companies help clients accelerate their digital transformation initiatives, the nature of deals is becoming shorter and smaller. Digital projects are aimed at solving specific customer pain points and therefore tend to be smaller in size and value, and of shorter duration than traditional contracts. “Some customers want to introduce a big digital programme, so they break it into smaller programmes and then take it step by step. So, we see a higher percentage of smaller deals in the overall pipeline,"" C. Vijayakumar, chief executive officer and managing director, HCL Technologies Ltd said in a recent interview. “As we see, I think there are lots of mid-sized and large deals as well in the pipeline. We have always enjoyed a very good renewal rate of over 90% in our services business, and it continues to be in that range."" With the overall macro environment beset with various challenges, short-term deals are being increasingly accepted by both clients and vendors. “In our view, clients prefer short tenure digital deals because they can easily track their return on investment with the launch of new platforms or programmes in a phased manner. So, many clients do not opt to launch the entire transformation programme at one go, given the higher risk,"" said Ashis Dash, IT analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. From n software services provider’s point of view, short-term contracts are beneficial given the faster conversion of revenue. “Further, the vendor is able to push for price increase during signing of the next phase of the digital transformation programme based on its understanding of earlier programmes and complexities of the new deals, which would be beneficial in terms of margins for the IT services vendor,"" added Dash. The short-cycle digital deals typically span for about 6-12 months and clients usually choose the existing vendor to execute subsequent phases of its transformation programme. Historically, the software services companies have been organized to deliver large projects at low costs. However, digital projects have opposite characteristics. “These are smaller, complex projects where margins as a percentage of revenue are higher. Digital projects, like consulting projects, are also the gateway to downstream work, which presents larger and longer maintenance opportunities. Digital projects need to be viewed as the tip of the spear in IT, much like consulting projects,"" said Abhisek Mukherjee, co-founder and director, Auctus Advisors. During the March quarter, none of the local software services companies bagged a mega deal worth $1 billion or more. To be sure, the share of digital revenue continues to rise for most of these companies. For Infosys Ltd, revenue from digital business grew 38.8% in constant currency from a year earlier and contributed 59.2% to the total revenues for the quarter ended March. For HCL Technologies, digital or ‘mode 2’ business grew 31.6% in constant currency from a year ago and contributed 27.2% to the revenues for the March quarter. Some such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro Ltd have stopped calling out digital revenues separately as the lines between traditional and digital offerings are getting blurred. Going forward, the share of the digital revenue is only expected to rise. Organizations across industries are adopting digital transformation strategies and quickly adapting to new ways of working to serve their customers. The worldwide IT spending is projected to total $4.4 trillion in 2022, an increase of 4% from 2021, according to the latest forecast by research firm Gartner Inc. The major growth drivers of this massive digital transformation are the adoption of industry 4.0, the use of advanced technologies such as cloud, IoT, big data and analytics, mobility, and social media."
Updated: 25 May 2022,India puts 'new reality' on display with Davos street show,https://www.livemint.com/news/world/india-puts-new-reality-on-display-with-davos-street-show-11653487402332.html,"DAVOS : Bright colours and bold logos proudly signal where India has set up base on the main street in Davos this year, as the country trumpets its pro-business and foreign investment drive. Inside a pavilion on the Swiss Alpine resort's Promenade street beneath an ""India @ Davos 2022"" logo, the federal government served up treats including 'masala chai' tea, 'samosa' snacks and other spicy delicacies. Clustered around it are six Indian states with their own lounges, housed in what are usually high street shops. ""It's an Indian street, it should be called 'Little India'. It shows the country is open for investments,"" said Samir Saran of India's Observer Research Foundation. Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told Reuters that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had suggested bringing states together to showcase unity at the gathering of business and political leaders at the World Economic Forum. ""Investors love this kind of a messaging,"" Goyal said. While India has long had a presence at the World Economic Forum, several officials and attendees from Asia's third-largest economy said it was not previously so prominent. At the government's base, food was being prepared by a team of 15 chefs who were flown in from India, along with 450 kilograms of vegetables and local spices, head chef Guru Nathan told Reuters, as people enjoyed a fragrant morning buffet. ""We were asked to keep the spice moderate so that everyone can enjoy (the food),"" Nathan said. Only a few steps down the road, Indian tech giants Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies have set up their bases close to those of Alphabet's Google, Meta and Intel. One state government official put the number of Indian officials attending Davos at more than 100, with scores of company executives and a handful of startups also present. Goyal estimated overall there would be 200 Indian participants. ""We have record numbers from India,"" Sriram Gutta, head of India agenda at the WEF, said. 'NEW REALITY' Federal ministers have talked about India's economic boom and the opportunities it offers at Davos. Although Modi's government has often faced criticism from foreign companies for announcing policies which they say are protectionist in nature and favour domestic companies, India recently reported its highest ever foreign direct investment inflow, which hit $83.57 billion in 2021-22. After engaging regularly with Indian states on subjects such as agriculture technology, drones and electric vehicles, the WEF has gradually increased the number of invitations to them, Gutta said, adding that they ""will continue to gain prominence"". Even though they are run by different political parties, the states were seeking to project a united image and showcase their respective offerings for businesses, Deepak Bagla, CEO of federal investment promotion arm Invest India, told Reuters. The southern state of Andhra Pradesh signed investment pacts worth a total of $16 billion for investment in renewables at Davos, while one official said Karnataka has held meetings with prospective investors. ""What this street really shows you is the new reality of India,"" Bagla said. This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text."
Updated: 23 May 2022,Top picks: ICICI Securities recommends these IT stocks to buy,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/top-stock-picks-icici-securities-recommends-these-it-stocks-to-buy-11653297719611.html,"Nifty IT has underperformed Nifty by 5% since the past one month. The correction can be attributed to headwinds of slowing revenue growth, reduced margins, elevated consensus expectations and of course stretched stock valuations, in addition to a weak macro environment. “We do believe valuations have contracted materially, but the price paid for high earnings growth is still elevated. We strongly suggest to investors that deployment in Indian IT services segment should be very slow and gradual as we believe there will be many unknown risks ahead, which might further hamper the valuations,"" the note stated. The start of slowdown induced by central bank policy tightening is already being seen. Among mid-caps, it has retained pecking order: Coforge, MTCL and Persistent Systems. Among large-caps, the brokerage has recommended TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Wipro, Tech Mahindra. It has downgraded Mphasis' shares rating from Buy to Add. Further, given the recent sharp correction over the past month, the brokerage has upgraded its rating on Newgen to Buy. “Emphasis on costs will likely lead to dampening of tech budgets and reduce discretionary spend. Macro factors such as GDP, PMI, S&P 500 revenues and CEO confidence are worsening by the day,"" ICICI Securities added. ""We expect a ‘J line’ curve in cost items in the P&L in FY23/FY24. For example, travel costs, which accounted for 2-3% of revenues, are down to ~0.5% now. Going forward, we will also have to take into account the already high inflation, which might push travel costs (and other costs too) way higher than pre-covid levels,"" it added. ICICI Securities still believes the fallen stock prices have not yet fully captured all the headwinds on growth and margins. The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint."
Updated: 13 May 2022,"IT/ITes to hire up to 1 mn by end-2023, says industry body",https://www.livemint.com/industry/human-resource/itites-to-hire-up-to-1-mn-by-end-2023-says-industry-body-11652383759868.html,"The domestic IT and ITes industry is set to hire 800,000 to one million people by the end of 2023, according to estimates by the Indian Staffing Federation (ISF), which represents more than 100 recruitment and flexi staffing companies.  The hiring frenzy in the tech sector will continue and it will take at least a year for the attrition to subside as the pressure to poach from rivals abates. “The sector is adding 400,000-500,000 a year and we do not see demand easing soon,"" said ISF president Lohit Bhatia. The tech sector currently employs about 4.5 million people. The industry body, which sees a large portion of the workforce with 0-8 years experience, does not expect any of the tech firms to change their non-compete clauses. “I don’t think any organization would completely open the no-compete clause and allow people to walk away with data and customer information,"" Bhatia said. ISF’s comments come on the back of a Pune-based labour union’s appeal to the Union labour ministry seeking removal of the non-compete clause by IT giant Infosys. The clause, a common practice in the industry, prevents employees from joining a rival firm on similar projects, clients, and geographies. The focus on these clauses come at a time when the tech sector is battling record high attrition. Infosys, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Technologies faced record high attrition levels in the March quarter. Infosys posted an attrition rate of 27.7%, while TCS had an attrition rate of 17.4% during the quarter. Wipro clocked an attrition rate of 23.8%, while that of HCL was 21.9%.  However, ISF’s Bhatia said that the attrition numbers will come down in a year. “Attrition is hovering around 25%. It will ease in a year once tech firms with their hybrid policies hire from smaller towns. This will ease pressure to recruit from rivals in cities,"" he said. The industry body is optimistic that hiring demand will be seen beyond technology as hospitality, aviation and retail sectors return to pre-pandemic levels. Most of the job roles are “covid proof"" where only a few may run the risk of a salary dip, according to a study by recruitment firm TeamLease Services. The Jobs and Salaries Primer FY 2021-22 was done from salary data of 410,000 employees and it showed that salaries grew by a minimum of 4.11 % and a maximum of 10.71% across sectors in FY22."
Updated: 12 May 2022,We see higher percentage of smaller deals in the pipeline: C. Vijayakumar,https://www.livemint.com/companies/we-see-higher-percentage-of-smaller-deals-in-the-pipeline-c-vijayakumar-11652379062271.html,"BENGALURU : The pandemic has shifted the way technology is being adopted by businesses, and cloud has now become a business strategy for a lot of clients instead of being only a technology strategy. The digital nature of deals has also changed in their sizes and duration. In an interview, C. Vijayakumar, chief executive and managing director, HCL Technologies Ltd, spoke about the changing nature of deals, expansion plans and acquisition strategy. Edited excerpts: Have the client budgets for this fiscal been finalized yet and which areas are they investing in? We are pretty much almost halfway to the calendar year, so the client budgets are already decided and as you would expect, a lot of them are investing in technology initiatives. One big initiative where we see a lot of customers investing is cloud adoption. The whole cloud strategy has become a business strategy for a lot of clients. This is because cloud offers a scalable platform, it allows the flexibility to scale up and down, and it allows you to collaborate with multiple industries. It is really the platform of innovation for a number of businesses. Given the digital nature of deals, have the deal sizes actually become smaller and of shorter durations? Some customers want to introduce a big digital programme, so they break it into smaller programmes and then take it step by step. So, we see a higher percentage of smaller deals in the overall pipeline. As we see, I think there are lots of mid-sized and large deals as well in the pipeline. We have always enjoyed a very good renewal rate of over 90% in our services business, and it continues to be in that range. What’s your strategy to expand into other markets apart from your core ones? We have a new strategy—one is called focus countries and the other is called new frontier countries. In the focus countries, there are five geographies where we are focusing on—Germany, France, Japan, Australia and Canada. These five are significant in terms of spending and we want to expand in these geographies. In the new frontier countries, we have low presence but we are building up our presence. These countries include Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Portugal, South Korea and Vietnam. We have already set up our presence there in the last couple of years and we are already seeing good traction in these countries. In the context of the Russia-Ukraine war, did you have any operations in either of these countries and do you continue to expand in other European countries? We did not have any operation in either of the two countries. We continue to ramp up in other East European countries such as Bulgaria, Romania and Poland. These are three important countries where we are continuing to scale up. There has been no noticeable impact from the war. What is your acquisitions strategy for this year? Our acquisitions will be mostly from a capability building point of view. We recently announced the acquisition of Confinale AG, a Switzerland-based digital banking and wealth management consulting specialist, which is expected to increase our footprint in the global wealth management market. We are open to looking at acquisitions as we see opportunities to add more capabilities. But our big focus is on organic growth. How has the pandemic changed the role of a CIO and what are the trends you see during your recent conversations? The pandemic has made resilience a very important requirement for every business and every leader. And chief information officers (CIOs) have played a huge role in demonstrating or establishing resilience for a number of businesses, whether it is work from home or managing the volume fluctuations that were part of what happened during the pandemic. I think the CIO’s role has become even more important because technology is driving a big part of the business outcome today. What are some of the new technologies HCL will be focussing on this year and beyond? Internet of things (IoT) is definitely a sharp focus area. Digital engineering is the other important area which includes 5G, softwarization, data engineering, and cloud modernization of applications. On the digital foundation side, we are very focused on security, SD-WAN (software-defined wide area network). In the digital workplace front, we are focused on experience services as the employees of our clients are so distributed today, working from anywhere. So, it is about offering a good experience of the IT platform."

The company founded by tech tycoon Shiv Nadar clocked revenues of $2.99 billion in the quarter to March 31, a jump of 11% over the past year, exchange filings show. It counts plane maker Boeing Co. and health care major Merck & Co among its clients and expects revenues to grow by as much as 14% in the year to March 2023. IT services for chip companies are also a focus area for HCL Tech, Malhotra said, as the world moves toward chip sovereignty with countries including the US, Japan and India wooing semiconductor makers to build factories.  Malhotra took over HCL, India’s third-largest IT services company, after her father stepped down in 2020. Nadar, considered a pioneer in India’s tech industry, started HCL in the 1970s as a hardware firm that made computers. The company gradually began offering software services to global clients and has since become a key player in India’s IT services industry.

Updated: 10 May 2022,Intel introduces new global rewards policy for employees,https://www.livemint.com/industry/human-resource/intel-introduces-new-global-rewards-policy-for-employees-11652122742478.html,"Intel Corp. introduced a rewards and recognition (R&R) programme for its 120,000 employees worldwide as the US chip giant seeks to attract new talent and retain existing employees amid a covid-induced spurt in demand for tech workers. “You’ve got to reward people for the work that they do. You also get to reward people in terms of an outcome and people like a tangible kind of a thing,"" Vijay Colaco, human resource director at Intel India said in an interview. He did not disclose the size of Intel’s workforce in India. The quarterly R&R programme will be over and above the annual appraisal cycle of an Intel employee and could result in either monetary or non-monetary benefits. “It could be either through money or higher education. You could also use various others ways to actually recognize and reward your employees,"" Colaco said. The new policy, which was rolled out six months ago, comes as technology firms devise new strategies to retain employees as they battle high attrition following increased digitalization and growing demand for tech workers. India is home to Intel’s second-largest research and development centre outside of the US. Attrition levels at Infosys, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Technologies hit record highs in the March quarter. Infosys posted an attrition rate of 27.7% while TCS had an attrition rate of 17.4% during the quarter. Wipro clocked an attrition rate of 23.8% while that of HCL was 21.9%. “Employee engagements have to become more often than an annual discussion during appraisal. More IT and ITes companies are coming up with quarterly R&R programmes. Annual cycles will in future only be used for corrections and inflation adjusted hikes,"" said Guruprasad Srinivasan, group chief executive at recruitment firm Quess Corp. He pointed out that the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) and retail sectors had monthly and quarterly incentives, and R&R programmes for sales teams. This concept is now being increasingly adopted across profiles and sectors. According to recruiters, after a two-year work from home policy with companies asking employees to return to offices, budgetary allocations towards R&R have to increase as employees will need more incentives. Product firms and other tech companies are also facing the brunt of the ongoing hiring frenzy. However, Intel’s attrition is “below the average semiconductor, IT sector"", Colaco said without elaborating. He said the latest form of R&R is not a top down approach. “I think that’s certainly not working. Earlier, the manager tells you to do these 10 things and people say ...I’ve delivered; now, what next and I don’t want to do this anymore. I’ll go do something else,"" Colaco said. The latest co-created approach is very unique to Intel, he said adding that the company runs a quarterly engagement activity between a manager and an employee where they engage in discussions. The employee needs to know how his work is impacting the broader organization and whether he is “touching the big picture"", he said. “We have got managers to start focusing working on the individuals to start understand the purpose, the vision, and the impact of their work...when you bring in a co-created methodology between a manager and employee, the sense of purpose and the sense of gratification also starts coming in and you see that quickly on quarter-on-quarter basis,"" Colaco said."

Still, aided by the IT services vertical, HCL’s overall revenue grew by 1.1% in constant currency terms. This measure stood at 3.2% and 1.2%, respectively for peers Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd. For FY22 as well, HCL has underperformed these two on constant currency revenue growth and earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) margin. For FY23, HCL has guided for 12-14% revenue growth and 18-20% Ebit margin. In comparison, Infosys’ constant currency revenue growth and operating margin guidance is 13-15% and 21-23%, respectively.

HCL Technologies said it expects revenue for this fiscal year to grow between 12-14% in constant currency (cc). It also forecast EBIT margin in the range of 18-20% for FY23. Those at Jefferies have also maintained Buy rating on the IT stock with revised price target of ₹1,360 on strong growth and reasonable valuations. “While HCL Tech's Q4 revenues beat estimates, the 110bps QoQ fall in margins disappointed. PAT beat estimates due to forex gains and lower tax rate. Its FY23 growth guidance of 12-14% was the key positive from 4Q and implies a strong 14-16% growth in its services business. However its margin guidance of 18-20% for FY23 and higher tax rate drives 6-7% cuts to our EPS estimates,"" Jefferies' note stated. HCL’s dollar revenue in the quarter grew 13.3% annually in constant currency to $2.99 billion, boosted by new deal wins and acceleration in clients’ digital agenda. Brokerage Nirmal Bang believes HCL Tech too will see negative impact of the stagflationary environment developing in the western world, which may impact tech spending towards 2HFY23 and affect its FY23 guidance. “However, we believe it is better placed in the new demand environment due to its enormous automation related skills and IP,"" the brokerage added and has an ‘Accumulate’ tag on the stock with target price of ₹1,247.

Updated: 22 Apr 2022,HCL pegs FY23 revenue growth at 12-14%,https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/hcl-pegs-fy23-revenue-growth-at-1214-11650566845922.html,"BENGALURU : After a year of offering only directional guidance, HCL Technologies Ltd on Thursday said it expects revenue for this fiscal year to grow between 12-14% in constant currency on the back of a buoyant market environment and strong growth momentum in the last three quarters, especially in the services business. It also forecast earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit) margin in the range of 18-20% for FY23.  Noida-based HCL posted a net profit of ₹3,593 crore for the March quarter, up 24% from a year earlier, excluding the impact of a one-time bonus paid to employees and tax expenses in the same period last year. Profit topped the consensus estimate of ₹3,322 crore in a Bloomberg poll.  Revenue for the March quarter rose 15% from a year earlier to ₹22,597 crore in line with Bloomberg estimate of ₹22,640 crore. Revenue was driven by the services business which recorded a compound quarterly growth rate (CQGR) of 5.2% for three straight quarters. Revenue for the full-year ended 31 March jumped 13.6% to ₹85,651 crore on the back of strong performance by business segments led by its digital business or ‘Mode 2’ that grew 31.8% in constant currency. HCL’s dollar revenue in the quarter grew 13.3% annually in constant currency to $2.99 billion, boosted by new deal wins and acceleration in clients’ digital agenda. “Over the last three quarters, our services business has been consistently growing organically at 5% and higher, delivering one of the highest CQGR in the industry. Our overall growth on YoY basis stands at 12.7%, which is better than the guidance, led by strong momentum in digital, cloud and engineering services. We continue to invest proactively to create a larger talent pool to address the demand,"" said C. Vijayakumar, HCL’s chief executive and managing director.  Meanwhile, the company’s attrition rate in the March quarter rose to 21.9% from 9.9% in the previous year and 19.8% in the December quarter, indicating demand for technology talent continues to outstrip supply. The high attrition rate is expected to ease gradually during the course of this financial year.  HCL made record net addition of 39,900 employees during FY22, boosting its total headcount to 208,877. It hired 22,859 freshers during the year, which it expects to increase by 50% this year. “HCL’s revenue growth is in line with the trends we see in the market. HCL has deep industry expertise which aligns with the current requirements. It has developed industry solutions that can deploy quickly and provide agility to businesses. It has created a large number of industry cloud solutions to serve different segments of the industry…HCL will have to deal with attrition rates and drive transformations faster to reduce the legacy workload,"" said D.D. Mishra, senior director analyst, Gartner."
Updated: 07 Apr 2022,Demand outlook for IT companies seen strong even as margins witness pressure,https://www.livemint.com/industry/infotech/demand-outlook-for-it-companies-seen-strong-even-as-margins-witness-pressure-11649312334742.html,"BENGALURU: With Indian IT services companies are set to announce their fiscal fourth quarter earnings (Q4FY22) beginning next week, investors will keep an eye on both the numbers and trends. As per sector analysts, demand outlook for Indian IT services companies remains robust on the back of strong tailwinds for the industry following digital and cloud transformation initiatives with enterprise clients. India’s largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) will announce its Q4FY22 earnings on 11 April, while Bengaluru-based Infosys Ltd. will release its numbers on 12 April. “The companies continue to see a demand tailwind in terms of investment in newer technologies like cloud transformation, AI/ML, blockchain, which is expected to further propel demand in coming quarters,"" ICICI Securities said in an earnings preview report. Accenture, which follows a September-August accounting calendar, reported strong second quarter earnings last month beating its own estimates. Accenture’s commentary suggests that only 30% of applications have so far migrated to cloud, indicating a huge scope for cloud transformation deals ahead. Analysts expect the revenue commentary of Indian IT companies to remain strong in Q4, with no impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and inflation on demand. “While tier-II players would continue to outgrow tier-I companies, the gap should start shrinking in Q4. Revenue growth is expected to moderate QoQ in Q4 as a high base effect comes into play,"" brokerage firm Motilal Oswal said. Brokerage firms expect TCS, Infosys, and Wipro to report constant currency revenue growth of 3.0-3.5% sequentially, while HCL Technologies is expected to post the weakest growth of 2.0% on a quarterly basis due to negative impact of its products and platforms business. However, margins of IT companies are expected to come under pressure, and either remain flat or decline in Q4 due to supply side headwinds. According to brokerage firm Sharekhan, EBIT margin is expected to remain flat to negative sequentially in Q4, “owing to slower revenue growth, lateral hires, and increasing travel expenses."" Motilal Oswal shared similar views, “We may see muted margins on account of wage inflation and slower growth in Q4 FY22."" During the fourth quarter earnings, some of the key factors investors will watch out for are improvement in deal pipeline, demand outlook for FY23, hiring/attrition trends, and margin outlook, according to ICICI Securities. “Further, the proposed restructuring by TCS and whether other IT companies would also follow on the same or not, would be an area of interest for the investors."""
Updated: 04 Apr 2022,India-Australia pact resolves IT firms’ double taxation issue,https://www.livemint.com/industry/infotech/indiaaustralia-pact-resolves-it-firms-double-taxation-issue-11649011482878.html,"The India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (IndAus ECTA) inked on Saturday found a resolution to the double taxation issue for Indian information technology (IT) firms, allows duty-free access to Indian wines, and a Work and Holiday arrangement that experts believe will find many takers in India. Also, a negotiation sub-committee between India and Australia will start talks within 75 days to transform the interim pact into a full-fledged comprehensive economic cooperation agreement (CECA), according to the agreement’s text. In a major relief for Indian IT firms such as Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, and HCL Technologies Ltd, Australia has committed to resolving the long-pending double taxation issue that was affecting Indian tech firms operating in the country through amendments in its domestic law over the next few months. The resolution of this issue will happen in line with the implementation of the bilateral economic cooperation and bilateral free trade pact between the two nations and is expected to help Indian IT companies expand operations in Australia. The India-Australia deal is expected to be implemented in four months. According to industry estimates, Indian IT firms lost more than $1 billion in taxes due to existing provisions in the Australia-India double taxation avoidance agreement (DTAA) causing double taxation issues for these companies. Most IT firms take up projects where they do some portion of work on-site, and some from India. However, Australian courts have ruled that even the work done from India can be considered as royalties and be taxed as per local Australian laws. The same income is also taxed in India. “Nasscom has been advocating for this change for a few years and is delighted to see the roadmap for resolution under the ambit of the Australia – India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement,"" said Gagan Sabharwal, senior director at industry body Nasscom. “We will continue to work with both governments and are confident that amendments in the Australian domestic law will be made soon in the upcoming Parliament session to seal this intent,"" added Sabharwal. He said recognising talent mobility with four-year temporary work permits, spouses and dependent visas would enable enterprises in both countries to leverage digital talent skills, build digital capabilities at scale and collaborate through innovative startups. Queries emailed to Infosys, HCL, TCS, and Wipro remained unanswered till press time. While India has agreed to reduce the duty on Australian wines and, in turn, got duty free access on Indian wines, market access for Indian whiskeys and spirits may need to wait longer. The two sides have decided to set up a working group within the next six months of the agreement coming into force to consider market access, maturation rules for whiskey and other issues related to the Indian alcoholic beverage industry. The issue pertains to maturation rules, where Australian laws allow whiskeys and spirits only over two years of maturation. However, the Indian side has been pressing for the removal of this condition, arguing that Indian whiskeys mature faster due to the warmer climate and a two-year maturation rule results in a 10% volume loss due to evaporation. “This historic FTA facilitates better market access for quality Australian wines into India and opens up the Indian wine industry to great opportunities in cross border investment, expertise transfer, collaboration and partnerships… For liquor, where India is a major producer, some regulatory hurdles remain against the export of Indian products to Australia. However, the FTA outlines a roadmap with time frames to resolve such issues, and once it’s done, Indian industry will be a big gainer,"" said Vinod Giri, director general, Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies. Tariffs on Australian wines with a minimum import price of $5 per bottle will be reduced from 150% to 100% on the deal’s implementation and subsequently to 50% over 10 years. Also, duty on bottles with a minimum import price of $15 will be reduced from 150% to 75%, and subsequently to 25% over 10 years. The two sides have also agreed to set up a joint working group on wine for the exchange of information and cooperation on production and trade-related matters on wine. Australia has also agreed to implement a Work and Holiday arrangement with India within two years of the pact coming into effect, granting 1,000 visas, which will allow Indians who are over 18 years and less than 31 to stay in Australia for a year. It will be a multiple entry visa, allowing them to enter and re-enter Australia multiple times, take up paid or unpaid employment for up to six months and undertake study or training for up to four months."
Updated: 07 Mar 2022,TCS plans organisational revamp to double its revenue before 2030,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/tcs-plans-new-organizational-revamp-to-double-its-revenue-before-2030-11646635240400.html,"Tata Consultancy Services plans to overhaul its organizational structure with specialized groups targeted to help startups as well as large global firms as Asia’s largest software outsourcing provider gears up to double its revenues to $50 billion before 2030, according to people familiar. The Mumbai-based company will create four internal teams -- a business transformation group, incubation group, enterprise growth and another aimed at new business models, according to people familiar who didn’t want to be identified as the details are private. TCS is expected to present this proposed new structure at its board meeting this week, said one of the people.  The rejig is aimed at aligning TCS, India’s second-largest company by market value, with the changing needs of its clients who are increasingly looking to digitize in the post-Covid-19 world and the boom in startups. India’s IT services sector has been on a roll, buoyed by the pandemic-induced rush among enterprises to transform into work-from-anywhere, digital businesses, boosting growth and making it a $227 billion industry by end of March. A spokesperson for the company said TCS won’t comment on internal business plans or strategies. Business Journey TCS’s new structure is based on where its customers are in their business journey, the people said. It factors in, for instance, that a sub-$5 billion start-up would have a very different set of technology and business requirements than a large global corporation.  TCS, which employs over half-a-million around the world, the bulk of them in India, reported $25 billion in revenues for the year ended Dec. 31. Riding the sector boom, TCS and its rivals Infosys Ltd. and HCL Technologies have been signing on new customers, expanding contracts and hiring software programmers by the thousands every quarter. The outsourcing giant, part of the Tata Group, is also planning to open a dozen innovation centers globally including the U.S. and Europe, according to one of the people familiar. TCS, however, will need to manage its surging staff costs that partly led to the outsourcer missing analyst estimates on profit last quarter. The company provides a suite of services from cloud to data analytics and infrastructure management to world’s largest companies including Citigroup Inc., General Motors Co., Woolworths Group Ltd. and Petronas Gas Bhd.

The appellate tribunal also issued notice to Sahaj Bharti Travels, which had claimed a default of ₹3.54 crore by HCL Tech, to file its reply within two weeks and also granted one week to the IT firm to file a rejoinder to it.

For a long time, India’s IT sector has been a key driver of the country’s economy, and the segment got a further leg-up after the covid-19 pandemic broke out last March. In fact, IT funds have been the best performing on a three-, five-, and 10-year basis. Moreover, the tech sector has continued to scale new heights, as its weightage increased to 13.5% (up 230 basis points on a yearly basis in the calendar year 2021) in overall equity funds. The sector ranked second and is at an all-time high in respect of sectoral allocation by mutual funds, showed a recent report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd (MOFSL). Further, for the month of December, with regard to a value increase in terms of holding by mutual funds, five of the top 10 stocks were from technology: Infosys, TCS, HCL Technologies, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra. IT mutual funds have achieved outstanding returns in recent years. But do they have the potential to continue to do so in the future? Indian IT bellwether companies, TCS Ltd, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, recently came out with their earnings numbers for the third quarter of FY2022. According to Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities Research, which has a positive stance on the sector, in a seasonally weak quarter, Infosys (to a greater extent) and TCS (to a lesser extent) delivered better-than-expected revenue growth. “Wipro reported weaker-than-expected revenue growth, but within its guided band. Commentary of all three managements indicated continuing strong demand environment,"" it wrote. Rushabh Desai, founder of Rupee With Rushabh Investment Services, who is also bullish on the tech sector, says due to covid-19, the way things have shifted to the digital, this sector is going to take a good pace in the future. While experts are largely bullish on the IT sector, there are some concerns. For example, the tech sector is trading at a 70% premium to its 10-year average multiple. Meanwhile, Desai suggests taking exposure to a global technology sector instead of just focussing on India. “A FAANG plus or Nasdaq 100 based fund would be a good fit,"" he said. For taking exposure to the Indian IT sector, his pick is a flexi-cap fund, where the fund manager has the flexibility to choose a company in the IT sector that might do really very well. While information technology funds are expected to continue their fine form, investors should note that sectoral funds are risky. These funds can do very well in certain periods, but they can have downsides too."

The acquisition, which includes earnouts and synergy-linked payouts, will allow Tech Mahindra to expand its offerings to high-end digital engineering services for some of the largest insurance, re-insurance and financial services clients in the world, it said. Tech Mahindra is also investing a total of €20 million for a 25% ownership in SWFT and Surance platforms, two InsurTech ventures funded by CTC. SWFT is a software as a service, or SaaS-based digital customer engagement platform for digital brokers, price comparison websites and insurers. Surance, on the other hand, is a personal cyber insurance solution that helps in vulnerability assessment, cyber protection and cyber insurance coverage. Tech Mahindra said the acquisition would help scale its European presence, with over 700 IT professionals in contemporary technologies and processes. “The insurance industry is currently undergoing a significant transformation, which is driven by new emerging business models that are powered by disruptive digital technologies,"" said Vivek Agarwal, president of banking, financial services and insurance, and corporate development at Tech Mahindra. “In order to enable this digital transformation, we are investing in strengthening our capabilities to support insurers in accelerating their transition to cloud-based platforms and provide end-to-end engineering with a strong European nearshore presence."" “Becoming a part of a global entity like Tech Mahindra will give us immediate access to global scale and create tremendous growth and development opportunity for our people and the business,"" said Avraham Shaked, co-founder of CTC.

Indian IT companies have of late embarked on an acquisition spree to expand their services offerings and consulting businesses amid surging demand. The CTC acquisition, for instance, is part of recent efforts by Tech Mahindra to scale its offshore operations. The company has now made about 10 acquisitions in under 12 months. Early last year, it acquired two companies—US-based Infostar LLC (Lodestone) and London-based We Make Websites Ltd, for $105 million and £9.4 million (around $13 million), respectively. Last month, the company acquired Allyis India and Green Investments in an all-cash deal worth $125 million. The two firms are holding companies for Allyis Group, which has 600 employees and is based in the US. The very same month, Tech Mahindra said it had acquired US-based Activus Connect—a provider of work at home customer experience solutions—for a total consideration of up to $62 million. The acquisition is expected to bolster Tech Mahindra’s capabilities in emerging workplace solutions and strengthen the end-to-end customer experience portfolio. Similarly, HCL Technologies announced the acquisition of a 51% stake in German IT consulting company Gesellschaft fr Banksysteme GmbH (GBS). On 14 January, HCL Technologies agreed to acquire Hungary-based data engineering services provider Starschema Ltd for $42.5 million. The move is expected to bolster HCL’s capability in data-driven digital engineering and increase its presence in central and eastern Europe. In March 2021, Wipro closed the company’s largest-ever acquisition of technology consultancy to banking and financial services industry Capco for $1.45 billion. In December, it said it had acquired Edgile LLC for $230 million in cash."
Updated: 18 Jan 2022,Our demand pipeline is robust with a mix of deals: C. Vijayakumar,https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/our-demand-pipeline-is-robust-with-a-mix-of-deals-c-vijayakumar-11642440089192.html,"HCL Technologies Ltd, in its fiscal third-quarter earnings last week, posted a dollar revenue growth of 7.6% sequentially in constant currency to $2.97 billion, the fastest in almost 12 years, boosted by new deal wins and acceleration in clients’ digital spending. It also reported strong order bookings, with a total contract value (TCV) of new deal wins worth $2.13 billion, registering a 64% growth from a year earlier. In an interview, C. Vijayakumar, chief executive and managing director of HCL Technologies, comments on the client spending this year, growth strategy, and hiring outlook. Edited excerpts: How do you see your clients’ IT budgets for this calendar year and in which areas are they investing? Different clients are in different phases of their technology transformation journey. But what we can very clearly say is there is increased investments in cloud transformation, application and data modernization, and digital engineering. Different industries are focused on different aspects of the value chain. Some industries, which were ahead in their digital transformation journey, have already significantly transformed the front-office, so the emphasis is now more on rigorous back-office transformation. But some of the traditional industries were also lagging behind in the front office, so there is some amount of interest in investments expected in those areas. Also, the whole industrial sector is looking at smart manufacturing, industry 4.0 kind of programmes. And in certain industries like software and internet verticals, which is one of the strongest verticals for our engineering services, there is demand for softwarization, silicon design, AR/VR (augmented reality/virtual reality), and other newer technologies. What kind of deals is HCL focussing on more? First of all, our demand pipeline is very robust. There is a good mix of large, midsize, and small deals. The skew is a little more towards the smaller deals than the traditional patterns we had seen in the past. Usually, the large deals will be for three-five years. The medium and small deals could be a programme, which runs for 18 months or two years. But a lot of these programmes are large programmes that may get divided into smaller packets and get awarded and prioritized for execution. So, sometimes to say they are small deals may be a misnomer because there could be many small deals leading to the overall size of the deal being large. You continue to make acquisitions, the latest being data engineering firm Starschema. Will we see more such acquisitions? Starschema is a very small firm with revenue of about $13.5 million, so it is mainly a niche capability led acquisition. And this is what we are looking at. Our main focus will be organic growth. In the third quarter, the 7.6% sequential growth is all organic growth. On a year-on-year basis, too, the growth was largely organic. What is the company’s hiring outlook for FY23? It’s going to be dependent on several factors, and every quarter there are certain requirements. But the planning that we do is for freshers and this year we planned to hire 22,000 freshers of which over 16,000 have already been hired. Next year, our intention is to double the fresher headcount, not just in India but across the world. We are ramping up in the US, Europe, Mexico, Costa Rica, Vietnam, Canada, etc. We are ramping up fresh and lateral talent across the globe and also significantly investing in training our existing talent to take up higher-level work. How are you managing the high attrition levels and when do you see it moderating? There are two aspects to this. One is the supply-demand gap, which is significantly increasing the compensation. The second aspect is, our attrition is among the lowest in the industry, which is attributable to a people-friendly policy, and also on the upskilling and focussing on the quality of work that we have for the people. I think that’s what differentiates us. We continue to hire a lot of fresh talent. The high attrition levels are likely to last at least for the next 2-3 quarters."

Shares of HCL Tech tanked over 6% to ₹1,25 apiece on the BSE in Monday's opening trade. “HCL Tech delivered an exceptionally strong revenue growth in 3QFY22, above our estimate, led by its troubled Products and Platforms vertical, which did exceptionally well despite benefitting from seasonality and deal spill over from 2QFY22.

Its fastest revenue growth in many years came with uninspiring margin performance. In constant currency terms, revenue grew 7.6% sequentially, driven by a sharp rebound in its products and platforms vertical and spillover of deals from the September quarter. In a conference call with analysts, HCL’s management said fiscal third-quarter revenue growth was the highest in the past 47 quarters. What is more, last quarter, HCL signed eight large services and as many product deals spanning financial, technology and healthcare services. At the end of December, the total value contract of its new deals was $2.1 billion, an increase of 64% from a year ago. The management said the company’s deal pipeline is strong and broad-based across markets and verticals. So, it is unsurprising that HCL has retained its double-digit revenue growth guidance for FY22.   "

It now recognizes the significant opportunities in the mid-market space and is starting to exploit this market using its industrialized service catalogue. This may help HCL win new deals in all markets. However, attrition rates remain a more significant concern as is the case with all other providers,"" said D.D.

In a statement to Livemint, HCL Tech's spokesperson highlighted that for more than a decade, all junior management employees of the company were paid the variable pay in advance, as a supplement to their fixed salary. The employment contract/policy very clearly stated the terms of payment. “During the pandemic, beginning last year, the organization decided to waive off all the performance conditions attached to this component and pay 100% in advance to reward the employees. This advance variable payout (much like standard sign-on bonus terms and conditions) would be deducted if any employee left ahead of the completion of performance review cycle, in the final settlement,"" the spokesperson said. The clarification further added that going forward, the company will continue with the advance variable payout for our employees and have also waived off the recoveries w.e.f December 22, 2021.

Updated: 06 Jan 2022,IT companies likely to continue growth rally in Q3 on strong demand,https://www.livemint.com/industry/infotech/it-companies-likely-to-continue-growth-rally-in-q3-on-strong-demand-11641440214089.html,"Bengaluru: Indian IT services companies are likely to continue their growth rally in October-December despite it being a seasonally weak quarter due to furloughs and lower working days in key markets of the US and Europe. Analysts at brokerage firms believe IT companies will buck the trend of seasonally weak third-quarter earnings and report robust growth on the back of strong demand. “Attrition and supply-side pressure would start to ease off from this quarter and would continue to decline for the next two-three quarters,"" Edelweiss Securities said in a pre-earnings note. Most brokerages agree that the strong demand environment is expected to continue in Q3 FY22, with tier-2 players outgrowing tier-1 companies. “Mid-cap companies are likely to maintain growth outperformance over tier-1 companies due to consistent execution, better level playing field with shrinking deal sizes, client mining, and steady deal wins and pipeline,"" according to Emkay Global. “Higher attrition and shortage of skilled resources remain the key challenges in the short term."" Analysts expect tier-1 companies to deliver a sequential revenue growth in the range of 2.7-4.8% in constant currency while tier-2 players are likely to have a wider band of 1.1-10.5%. The outlook for the next fiscal and the quarters ahead is expected to remain strong. “We expect a strong initial outlook for FY23, with companies maintaining their view of multi-year growth tailwinds on the back of cloud migration. Guidance for Q4 FY22 is also expected to be positive on the back of continuing deal wins,"" Motilal Oswal said. Emkay Global expects Infosys Ltd to revise its FY22 revenue growth guidance to 17.5-18.0% in constant currency from 16.5-17.5% currently. HCL Technologies Ltd is likely to retain its double-digit revenue growth guidance for FY22 while Wipro Ltd is expected to guide for a 2-4% sequential growth in constant currency for Q4 FY22. According to analysts, the key factors to monitor are FY22 outlook, deals intake, and attrition rates. Investors will also watch out for management commentary on IT budget for this calendar year, steps taken to manage supply-side challenges along with levers to defend margins, demand environment in key verticals, pricing environment, and deals pipeline and closure momentum. Accenture recently reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings which is likely to pave the way for a positive earnings season for Indian IT companies. Accenture has revised its full-year revenue growth guidance to 19-22% from the earlier forecast of 12-15% which is seen as a positive cue for the sector. “Accenture’s November-ending quarterly results provide a glimpse into the strong industry momentum. Not just attrition cooled off from 19% to 17% (annualized), it even reported the highest headcount addition of 50,000 in the November quarter,"" Edelweiss Securities noted."
Updated: 17 Dec 2021,Demand for digital tech to help IT firms grow despite supply-side woes,https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/demand-for-digital-tech-to-help-it-firms-grow-despite-supply-side-woes-11639682396168.html,"BENGALURU : IT services companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd are expected to sustain their revenue growth momentum for the next few quarters on the back of continued demand for digital technologies such as cloud, data analytics, artificial intelligence, internet of things, 5G and cybersecurity. Tier-1 services firms posted a 2.6-6.9% sequential dollar revenue growth in the September quarter, while tier-2 companies reported a 6.1-12.8% sequential growth during the quarter. Analysts at Emkay Research expect the revenue momentum seen in the first half of this financial year to continue in the second half led by secular broad-based demand trends, healthy deal wins and continued ramp-up of large deals. To be sure, the total contract value (TCV) of deal wins moderated in the September quarter as deal tenures have become shorter due to clients’ urgency to execute digital transformation projects in a short span instead of signing large, longer-tenure deals that follow lengthy due diligence and legal process. TCS signed deals worth $7.6 billion in Q2FY22, lower than $8.1 billion in Q1. Infosys’ deal intake stood at $2.2 billion in Q2 against $2.6 billion in Q1, and Wipro’s large deal wins moderated to $580 million from $715 million in Q1. HCL was the only exception whose TCV for the second quarter rose to $2.2 billion against $1.66 billion in Q1. Seasonal factors such as lower working days and furloughs will weigh on Q3 sequential growth trajectory. Infosys raised its revenue growth guidance for FY22 to 16.5-17.5% in constant currency from the earlier guidance of 14-16%, while HCL Tech retained its double-digit growth guidance for FY22. Wipro guided for 2-4% sequential growth in Q3 and remained confident of delivering double-digit organic revenue growth in FY22. “As we finish Q3 and start to get into Q4, we will start to have a good idea of what the following financial year will look like. My own sense is the demand that we have is quite comprehensive and that will certainly continue to help us as long as we build out the new capabilities well and be part of the clients’ digital and cloud journey,"" Salil Parekh, CEO & MD, Infosys, told analysts during the Q2 earnings call. The deal pipeline in the coming quarters appears robust across the industry, driven by an uptick in digital transformation, cloud adoption and automation deals, Emkay Research said in a note. That said, the industry is expected to face supply-side challenges in the short term due to high attrition and shortage of skilled manpower. Attrition rates in Q2, for instance, were at record highs. The attrition rate at Infosys rose to 20.1% in the September quarter from 13.9% in the preceding quarter, while Wipro’s attrition rate rose to 20.5% from 15.5% during the same period. The attrition rate of TCS, though the lowest among its peers, increased to 11.9% in the September quarter from 8.6% in the preceding quarter. Wipro chief executive Thierry Delaporte said during the last earnings call that given the demand environment, the prevailing high levels of attrition are expected to continue for at least the next two to three quarters. Industry watchers expect the supply-side challenges to continue for the next few quarters despite some balancing off. “The high attrition we saw in Q2 will ease off a little, but even in 2022, the demand for niche skills will continue to outstrip supply… in some ways, it’s not a bad thing because if there is demand for talent, it means the industry is on a growth path. With high growth, you may have talent attrition, so one will have to find the right mix there,"" said Sangeeta Gupta, chief strategy officer, Nasscom."

Customer centricity remains a core driver of enterprise digital transformations, and this golden ticket is closely linked to the real gold in today’s value chains – a robust data strategy,"" the report said. In fact, the survey of over 400 IT and business decision makers confirms the correlation between having a clear data strategy and delivering a consistent omnichannel experience. As both customers and employees are going digital, 95% of survey respondents reported reliance on a public cloud to some extent. Taking a cloud-native approach is the need of the hour, however, only a third of the respondents indicated that their organization is fully cloud-native. “Throw a robust data strategy into the mix, and businesses can perfect the recipe for bringing speed, accuracy and optimal end-to-end delivery to their core offerings,"" the report said. According to the study, over 35% of companies lack the in-house expertise to shoulder an organization-wide transformation, and more importantly, nail the ultimate outcomes of such a massive process. Over 60% of respondents expect higher profitability and increased efficiency from their transformation strategy. While companies invest in upskilling and reskilling internally, building and leveraging a healthy partner ecosystem will be as critical to navigating an otherwise overwhelming business landscape, the report stated."

HCL is India’s third-largest IT outsourcing firm by revenue, generating more than 60% of its $11 billion in revenue in the US. “We estimate HCL is saving at least $95 million per year by illegally underpaying its H-1B employees. That’s $95 million in stolen wages from H-1B workers every year—white-collar wage theft on a grand scale—which has been facilitated by negligent labor standards enforcement in the H-1B program,"" the report said.

EPI analysis of an internal HCL document, released as part of a whistleblower lawsuit against the firm, claims that large-scale illegal underpayment of H-1B workers is a core part of the firm’s competitive strategy. The report further stated that “data from the company’s internal document suggests the firm underpays H-1B workers in virtually all jobs across all business lines."" A company spokesperson, however, said in a statement, “HCL Technologies is strictly compliant with all relevant rules and regulations and is committed to pay wages to all employees in accordance with applicable laws."" Last year, HCL ranked eighth in total H-1B approvals with about 1,405 new visas and 2,801 visa renewals.

The H-1B visa program is the largest US temporary work visa program for high-skilled workers, with approximately 600,000 visa holders currently in the US.

India's $190 billion IT services industry, led by Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys, has long used H1-B skilled worker visas to fly computer engineers to the United States, its largest overseas market, temporarily to service clients. But most companies began recruiting more heavily in the United States and some sped up acquisitions due to former U.S. president Donald Trump's protectionist technology visa policies. HCL has not made any ""strategic shift"" in terms of its H1-B dependence, Sundarajan said, adding that the company's H1-B visa applications were among the lowest for India-based companies. HCL last month said it opened a delivery centre in Hartford, Connecticut to service industrial tools maker Stanley Black & Decker. The Indian company said at the time it planned to use this centre for clients in other industries including in aerospace and defence, insurance, life sciences and health care.

On a trailing 12-month basis, the attrition rate of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) was lowest among its peers at 11.9% in the September quarter. During the same period, the attrition rate of Infosys Ltd stood at 20.1% while that of Wipro Ltd stood at 20.5%, and HCL Technologies Ltd, at 15.7%. More than 200,000 of Cognizant's total 318,400 employees work in India. When asked why the attrition rate was high, Rajesh Nambiar, chairman and MD, Cognizant India and president, Digital Business & Technology, said in an interview on Thursday, ""Attrition is an industry-wide concern. There is an unprecedented demand for talent and its widely known that the industry is impacted overall."" Nambiar, however, insisted that the steep attrition rate has not impacted Cognizant’s growth. ""We continue to deliver against our commitments to clients across the globe. Our bookings are at a healthy 24% growth year-on-year,"" he added. Analysts, though, point out that Cognizant has historically had a higher base attrition than peers, right from pre-Covid days. “As far as recent uptick goes, while some of it, both planned and unplanned, can be attributed to the ongoing transformation at Cognizant, it is more significantly the macros that are at play. The IT services industry has been witnessing higher attrition levels over the last few quarters on the back of a demand-supply gap for tech talent, especially digital skillsets, as well as increased prevalence of the gig-economy versus long-term employment,"" said Ankit Garg, associate director, Auctus Advisors. Cognizant, meanwhile, has taken a number of measures to address the high attrition levels. It has stepped up its recruitment engine by onboarding a record number of 17,000 new hires in the September quarter taking its total headcount to 318,400. It is on track to onboard 30,000 new employees this year and roll out an additional 45,000 offers for 2022. “We have also restructured our leadership with a good mix of internally promoted talent and lateral hires. We have a deep bench of seasoned talent and a highly skilled dedicated global team,"" Nambiar said. As a measure to retain talent, Cognizant has announced its annual merit cycle effective 1 October for most employees. “We continue to revisit and benchmark ourselves with the salaries in the marketplace and then we will do what it takes. Same thing with the promotion cycles. We continue to do a quarterly promotion cycle,"" Nambiar said. Cognizant also has a special jobs promotion programme which enables qualified employees to take up a role above their current level. “The training programmes are really helping us to retain our people…we are focusing on areas which will increase our stickiness with the employees and ensure that we are truly being an employer of choice,"" Nambiar said. Cognizant has deployed a phased approach to bring its employees back to the office and scale up operations as needed. “Given the success of our vaccination program, we introduced our Flexible Workspace program on 15 September which is a voluntary option for fully vaccinated associates to work from select Cognizant facilities,"" Nambiar said."

Back then, the Noida-headquartered company, according to its senior management, termed its foray into the products and platforms, or P&P, business as an inflection point in the firm’s history—something which no other home-grown information technology (IT) services firm had done. More than two years after it started booking revenue from its largest acquisition, and five years after it first made its foray into software products and platforms, HCL is struggling, to put it mildly, to reap the full benefits from its IBM acquisition. Three straight quarters of sequential decline (in constant currency terms) in the P&P business has made at least three analysts wonder whether business from this division may have already peaked. To make matters worse, the profitability of the P&P business has nosedived over the last fifteen months from 33% at the end of March 2020 to 19.4% at the end of September 2021.

As a policy, it only provides a directional revenue guidance. The Noida-based IT services firm continues to see increased momentum from its digital or Mode 2 business that grew 36.3% year-on-year in constant currency during the September quarter. In an interview with Mint, C. Vijayakumar, chief executive officer and managing director, HCL Technologies, talks about the demand environment, digital growth and the deal momentum. Edited excerpts:   How is the overall demand environment for the next few quarters? The overall demand environment is strong. There are three broad areas where there is a significant change in demand. The first is modernizing the application landscape and embedding more and more analytics into everything that businesses are doing, from modernization in commerce to supply chain to customer experience. The second theme is migration to cloud as a lot of our clients are embarking on a cloud transformation journey where cloud strategy is part of the business strategy for several clients. The third area is digital engineering, which includes industry 4.0, 5G, building next-generation products and converting on-premise products into SaaS (software-as-a-service) products. All of these are driving strong demand in the market. As mega deals can be a key differentiator, what is HCL’s strategy to win such deals? We cannot really predict such mega deals. When we find one, we obviously have all the right leadership and strategies to win the game as we have won in the past in the case of Xerox, Volvo Cars and others. These are all sweet spots for HCL. However, today we see more of the mid to large size deals in the range of $50 million to $200 million in the market. Last quarter, we signed 14 new large deals worth a total contract value (TCV) of $2.25 billion. If you look at our client additions, it has been very aggressive. Our $50 million clients increased from 29 to 41 in 12 months. So, a lot of incremental growth from our existing clients is also driving the deal momentum. What is HCL’s digital game plan and how do you differentiate yourselves as far as digital is concerned? First, a lot of customers are moving to a vertical product-led operating model. So, we are very focused on IT operating model changes, which are driven by business operating model changes, which requires not only physical transformation skills but also significant organizational management capabilities. In fact, many of the deals that we won are led by this. The second piece is the infrastructure and applications, integrated modernization and operations. The third piece is of course cloud. We are one of the strongest players here. So, these are the three broad areas and then we are also the largest engineering services player. Digital engineering is an area that we have invested in and we continue to invest. So, that will be a strong differentiator for us. What led the products and platforms business to decline 8% sequentially and 5.5% annually in Q2? The products and platforms business is a seasonal business and the September quarter is the weakest one. Some of the deals due for the second quarter slipped to the current quarter. Otherwise, the overall business remains strong. All of our strategic initiatives are going well and we are very confident of the overall growth trajectory for these solutions."

The Sensex closed at 60,737.05, up 452.74 points or 0.75% Most Asian stocks rose Thursday as traders assessed the durability of the economic recovery to inflationary pressures and a looming reduction in the Federal Reserve’s pandemic-era stimulus. Equities advanced in Japan and South Korea and fluctuated in China, where data showed the fastest climb in producer prices since 1995. US futures pushed higher after Wall Street snapped a three-day losing streak, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 outperforming the S&P 500. Among major companies, HCL Technologies, Cyient, Century Textiles & Industries, , Indiabulls Real Estate and Inox Wind Energy will release their September quarter results today.

Reliance Industries Ltd on Wednesday said differences between Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd’s managing director Punit Goenka and Invesco, the company’s single-largest shareholder, over how the Goenka family would raise its stake in the broadcaster led to a collapse in merger talks with RIL’s media properties. The power ministry cautioned states as early as 18 August about depleted coal stocks failing to match the sharp increase in electricity demand. The warning bells were twinned with a request to clear their pending fuel and transportation dues, according to a Mint exclusive. Longer term treasuries pared a rally, while a key part of the Treasury yield curve has flattened to around a one-year low. US inflation held above 5% and Fed minutes signalled a tapering of bond purchases from mid-November or mid-December. Meanwhile, a 30-year Treasury auction drew strong demand. Crude oil stabilized above $80 a barrel and gold was near the highest in nearly a month. Singapore’s dollar rose after the central bank unexpectedly tightened monetary policy settings. Investors continue to evaluate the resilience of the economic rebound from the pandemic to supply chain disruptions, a jump in energy prices and the prospect of reduced central bank support. The Joe Biden administration in the US is trying to relieve supply-chain bottlenecks ahead of the Christmas shopping season, but officials acknowledge their options are limited. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers castigated US monetary policy makers for paying too much attention to social issues and not enough to the biggest risk to inflation since the 1970s.
