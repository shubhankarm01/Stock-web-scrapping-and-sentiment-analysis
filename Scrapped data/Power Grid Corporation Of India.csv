Updated: 30 Apr 2022,"Power cuts continue in UP, Punjab, other states amid coal crunch, heatwaves",https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/power-cuts-continue-in-up-punjab-other-states-amid-coal-crunch-heatwaves-11651278452033.html,"Several Indian states faced power cuts for up to 10 hours in the past two days amid coal shortages and increased temperature. According to a report by the Hindustan Times, Livemint's sister publication, 100 out of the 165 operational coal plants in the country are running at a ""critical level"" of stocks. The current power crisis highlights the strained finances of the country's power sector where many firms have run out of money to pay for replenishment or buy from the grid, or have not placed an order on time. The power generation companies are also reluctant in purchasing more expensive coal imports. Power officials also said more electricity is available on the grid but some states preferred load shedding over paying extra. The blackouts are also the outcome of an unrelenting surge in power demand due to heatwave, compounded by a lack of freight train wagons that carry coal from mines to plants. Consequently, states such as Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan have opted for 8-10 hours of unscheduled power cuts, mostly in smaller towns and rural areas. Data from Power System Operation Corporation (Posoco) showed that India’s power demand hit a new record of 207,000 MW on April 28. On the other hand, the Union Power Ministry has said that firms in states are resorting to load-shedding for cost cutting. Yesterday, power secretary Alok Kumar said that there was still up to 5,000 MW of power available in the Central pool, but no state has placed any request so far. Further, the temperature touching 47 degrees in some parts of the country has led to increased power demand. In April, which is set to be one of the hottest since 1951, the power demand has risen by 50% in states such as Punjab. India's overall electricity demand has risen by around 10% as compared to last year. Yesterday, Union Power Minister RK Singh said that power outages are due primarily because states have not paid their dues to Coal India and are unable to lift allocated coal on time."
Updated: 19 Apr 2022,"Crisis-hit Sri Lanka, India revive talks to link electric grids: Report",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/crisishit-sri-lanka-india-revive-talks-to-link-electric-grids-report-11650368873468.html,"COLOMBO : India and Sri Lanka have resumed talks on linking their electricity grids, officials told Reuters on Tuesday, a step that could aid New Delhi's goal of reducing China's influence on the island nation, now grappling with a severe economic crisis. There was no immediate prospect that power cuts brought by the crisis could be eased by the talks, which are a preliminary effort on a multi-year project both sides have explored before. India has extended assistance running into billions of dollars to its southern neighbour to fight the crisis, brought on by a steep drop in foreign exchange reserves that stalled imports of essentials such as fuel, so disrupting power supply. ""It is at very initial stages of discussion,"" Wasantha Perera, secretary of Sri Lanka's power ministry, told Reuters, but gave no further details. Protests and political turmoil brought on by rocketing inflation, a currency devaluation and shortages have spurred the nation of 22 million to begin talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a loan programme, also backed by India. Now officials of both countries are turning to a project that has made little progress since it was first proposed more than a decade ago, aiming to link the neighbours with a miles-long transmission line running under the Indian Ocean. The grid connection project came up in talks with India's power ministry in March, when Basil Rajapaksa, then Sri Lanka's finance minister, visited New Delhi to seek assistance, said a source with knowledge of the matter. ""It will be mutually beneficial,"" added the source, who sought anonymity, as the talks were private. The foreign ministries of both India and Sri Lanka did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The project figured among the key objectives of a strategy paper issued by Sri Lanka's diplomatic mission in India last July. ""This would enable Sri Lanka to obtain electricity during operational maintenance and droughts, and also to export excess generation to India,"" it said in the document. Nearly two-thirds of Sri Lanka's electricity is generated by oil and coal-fired plants, while hydro makes up the rest. Its total daily power demand is just a fraction of India's, and meeting peak demand can be a challenge during times of drought. Vying for influence Beijing and New Delhi have long vied for influence over the island, strategically located just off India's southern tip, and Indian assistance in recent weeks has swelled amid a worsening crisis that has brought thousands on the streets. The grid connectivity project could become part of New Delhi's requests from Sri Lanka, which has also secured Chinese infrastructure deals in recent years, a source with knowledge of India's thinking told Reuters, on condition of anonymity. Until now, India has provided aid amounting to about $1.9 billion through credit lines and swaps, and is ready to commit up to $2 billion more to help Sri Lanka tackle its worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948. The plan to link the two grids has been in the works for years, with the neighbours signing a pact in 2010 on feasibility studies for an undersea power cable. A study by the Power Grid Corporation of India envisaged deployment of either a 500-megawatt (MW) or a 1,000-MW undersea transmission system, the state-run company said in an annual report in 2015. The shortest distance separating India and Sri Lanka is a narrow strip of ocean called the Palk Strait, which is about 40 kilometres (24.85 miles) wide, though the length of an undersea cable would depend on its alignment. Subsea electrical cables with long spans include the NordLink, between Germany and Norway, which is about 623 km (387 miles) long."
Updated: 02 Mar 2022,Super 15: Stocks benefitting from rising popularity of ESG theme ,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/super-15-stock-benefitting-from-rising-popularity-of-esg-theme-11646195130371.html,"In a post-Covid world, conscious investing has gained lot of traction among investors. In fact, in 2021, at a global platform, India made a commitment to reach net carbon zero by 2070. With the environment, social and governance (ESG) theme fast catching-up, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd have outlined key considerations for investors and picked stocks from five sectors to bet on this theme. They are as follows: 1) Coal Sector: The fundamental question for India's transition is linked to its coal sector. Ensuring a well-planned and just transition away from coal will be a significant challenge, with both risks and opportunities in the power sector and beyond. With around 8% of state revenue from coal activities, diversification of the economy is needed. Coal India Ltd will be central to the transition. The company has already taken steps to diversify into renewable power, with three gigawatts of planned solar capacity to FY24. Natural gas is also set to play a significant role in displacing coal. GAIL India Ltd operates around 220 mmsmd (million metric standard cubic meter per day) of pipeline capacity and is the largest LNG trader in India. 2) Agriculture accounts for around 20% of India's greenhouse gas emissions and is the main source of non-carbon dioxide related emissions. Opportunities exist for investors through chemical free farming and low-cost solutions which improve irrigation and energy efficiency. UPL Ltd will likely play a central role in decarbonisation efforts. Through various projects, it is driving the adoption of digital solutions and increased penetration of bio-solutions. 3) Road Transport: With auto demand set to grow to 2040, an uptake in electric power-trains is an important area of focus for policy-makers. Tata Motors Ltd leads the local market with nearly 7% market share. Bajaj Auto Ltd, TVS Motor Company Ltd & Hero MotoCorp Ltd are actively expanding their electric vehicles portfolios. 4) Power Utilities: State-run distribution companies will underpin India's energy transition. Their financial fragility however currently inhibits their appetite for investment and transformation of the power grid. NTPC Ltd should be a key beneficiary of new renewable capacity given its access to low cost funding. Power Grid Corporation of India, Larsen & Toubro Ltd, Siemens Ltd and KEI International Ltd could all see tailwinds from increased transmission and distribution spend. 5) Heavy Industry: Heavy industry's share of energy consumption has increased to 42%, making it the largest end user of energy. Incumbents are focused on renewable power with Shree Cement Ltd, The Ramco Cements Ltd and Ultratech Cement Ltd all active in this regard."

Asian stocks started off on a weak footing on Tuesday after a largely soft performance on Wall Street and as persistent concerns over the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus dented sentiment and triggered falls in metals and oil prices. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan declined 0.4% in early trading, with Korea’s Kospi index down 0.56% while China’s blue chip index CSI300 shed 0.33%.

Domestic air passenger traffic rose steeply for the second consecutive week, as a fall in covid-19 cases, lower fares, and the easing of curbs by most states encouraged more people to take to the skies. Average number of daily fliers rose to 227,000 in the week ended 7 August from 165,000 a week before, broking firm ICICI Securities said in a report on Monday. Oil prices were recovering on Tuesday after falling as much as 4% in the previous session, which extended last week’s steep losses amid a rising US dollar and concerns that new coronavirus-related restrictions in China could slow a global revival in fuel demand. US crude oil futures were trading at $66.82 per barrel, up $0.35 or 0.53%. Brent crude was at $69.29, up $0.25 or 0.36% higher.

Investors were still assessing whether Friday’s strong US payrolls report would take the Fed a step nearer to winding back its stimulus. However, the pace of tapering was still up in the air and would decide when an actual rate increase comes, he said. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion of assets a month. The spread of the Delta variant could argue for a longer taper. In the currency markets, the dollar index moved 0.02% higher, with the euro off 0.03% to $1.1732, its lowest since early April. The dollar held firm against the yen at 110.38 yen, near its highest level in about two weeks. The US currency’s broad rally came as US Treasury yields spiked to three-week highs on the back of the strong jobs data and early Fed taper speculation. (Reuters contributed to the story)"

The MeECL owes ₹74.65 crore to Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (PGCIL) as transmission charges, and it was not in a position to pay the dues due to extreme financial condition of the company, the official said. ""We can barely afford to pay the salaries of our employees. Recently we had requested the state government to extend ₹113.47 crore financial assistance to make payment for the outstanding bills of PGCIL and to reinstate the letters of credit with central generating stations. ""Deliberations are going on at the highest levels of the government,"" the MeECL said in a statement. The MeECL was forced to regulate about 70MW of energy and the PGCIL wanted a firm commitment on payment of 50 per cent of dues in one week and a definite timeline for the remaining 50 per cent, it added. The state government has availed a loan of ₹1,345 crore under #AatmanirbharBharat from the Centre to clear all outstanding power purchase dues of the MeECL. ""The loan under the special package given by the Prime Minister will be disbursed to all gencos and transcos which include NEEPCO, OTPC, NHPC and PGCIL. We expect that we will be able to end all our liabilities to the generating companies and transmission companies soon,"" state's Power Minister James Sangma said.

Updated: 29 Oct 2019,India looks to provide overhead power connection to Sri Lanka,https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/india-looks-to-provide-overhead-power-connection-to-sri-lanka-11572147637418.html,"NEW DELHI : The Union government is exploring the option of an overhead electricity link with Sri Lanka as part of India’s strategy to create a new-energy ecosystem for the neighbourhood against the backdrop of China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. The overhead line is being considered after the earlier proposal to set up an undersea power transmission link to supply power to the island nation turned out to be prohibitively expensive. The earlier plan involved state-run Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd setting up a link for 1,000MW between India and Sri Lanka, of which 30km would be under the sea. The transmission link was to run from Madurai in Tamil Nadu to Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka’s north-central province. “We have to connect Sri Lanka because Sri Lanka needs power. The undersea link will be expensive. They are talking about an overhead transmission link,"" said a senior official of the Union government, requesting anonymity. Cross-border energy trade is a key part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s South Asia-focused neighbourhood-first policy. The electricity link is part of India’s strategy to negate the growing influence of strategic rival China in the Indian Ocean region and South Asia. In recent years, China has tried to co-opt Sri Lanka into its ambitious One Belt One Road initiative, a programme to invest billions of dollars in infrastructure projects, including railways, ports and power grids, across Asia, Africa and Europe. Mint reported in November 2009 about the Sri Lankan government questioning the long-term feasibility of the project, which is meant to enhance economic and political ties between the neighbours. The earlier proposal also faced opposition from the Tamil Nadu government. State-run Ceylon Electricity Board has an installed power generation capacity of 35.8 gigawatts (GW). India has an installed power generation capacity of 360.45 GW, with the national grid capable of transferring 99,000 MW of electricity from any corner of the country. Experts have welcomed the move of exploring the possibility of establishing an overhead electricity link with Sri Lanka. “Over the last few years, India has become a well-coordinated and cohesive national market, which has helped tide over the disparity in demand and supply among states and regions in the country. The benefit of this transition that we have witnessed in our nation can be offered to our neighbours as well with the integration of Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka,"" said Prabhajit Sarkar, managing director and chief executive officer, Power Exchange India Ltd. India has been supplying power to Bangladesh and Nepal, and has also been championing a global electricity grid that may initially aim to link countries, such as Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, with the sub-continent. India’s energy diplomacy initiatives range from cross-border electricity trade to supplying petroleum products and setting up liquefied natural gas terminals. “Participation in a common power market will lead to better utilization of generation assets, wider benefit of efficient price discovery, and reduced counter-party search and transaction efforts for all participants. The cross-border trading regulation has already been notified and, within the next few months, it is expected that a vibrant market will take shape, allowing our neighbours to also benefit from the highly liquid and extremely efficient power exchange developed in India,"" Sarkar added.T"

Located in Dhenkanal district of Odisha, GMR Kamalanga Energy is a 1050 megawatt (MW) coal based power plant that has fuel linkages with Mahanadi Coal Fields, one of the major coal producing subsidiaries of Coal India Ltd. The plant is strategically located close to the coal belt and has a 15% untied capacity to benefit from the merchant market, according to the company’s website. The plant also has a long term power purchase agreement with Grid Corporation of Odisha, Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam, as well as Bihar State Electricity Board. For the quarter ended 30 June, the Kamalanga plant had sales of ₹554.3 crore, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of ₹171 crore and losses of ₹33 crore. The development comes as the GMR Group is monetizing its assets in road and power sectors to reduce its debt. While the net debt of GMR Infrastructure Ltd. (GIL) stood at ₹22,520 crore, its energy business (excluding the under construction Bajoli Holi Project) comprised ₹8,400 crore of GIL’s debt, as of 30 June. In August, Adani Power acquired 52.38% stake in GMR Chhattisgarh Energy Ltd from its consortium of lenders at an enterprise valuation of about ₹3,530 crore. The plant owns and operates a 1,370 MW (2 X 685 MW) power plant at Raikheda village in Raipur. In May, GIL got lenders’ approval for its debt resolution plan for the natural gas-based power plant subsidiary GMR Rajahmundry Energy Ltd. (GREL) with the IDBI Bank-led consortium of lenders. GMR Rajahmundry Energy operates a 768 MW natural gas-based power plant at Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh. GMR Energy is a joint venture between GMR Group and Tenaga Nasional Berhad, wherein GMR Group holds a 52% stake, while Tenaga holds 30%. Tenaga is listed on Bursa Malaysia."

Updated: 13 Mar 2008,Orissa to sell power to other states after 2012,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/lfrYcGErXdOleAMZyBvD3K/Orissa-to-sell-power-to-other-states-after-2012.html," Bhubaneswar: The Orissa government on Thursday said that an additional 33,000 MW of power would be generated in the state by 2012 and about Rs1.5 lakh crore would be invested for transmission systems for sale of surplus power to other states. “Of the 33,000 MW, extra power targeted to be generated by 2012, around 17,000 MW will be produced by 13 independent power projects for which MoUs have been signed and the rest by public sector units like NTPC,"" State Energy Minister Surya Narayan Patro said here. The Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd would invest nearly Rs1.5 lakh crore for the transmission system for supplying surplus power to other states, he said. Stating that Orissa would get about 11,000 MW from generating companies as per agreements signed, Patro said the remaining 22,000 MW would be sold to buyers outside the state for six paise per unit of power. Orissa would require only 4,000 MW to meet its projected internal demand and the remaining 7,000 MW would be sold to other states facing power scarcity, he said. As a result, the Minister said the total volume of power to be evacuated from the state, including the electricity to be directly sold by generating companies, would be of the order of 29,000 MW. “The huge additional power will go waste if the required transmission systems are not installed in the next four years,"" he added. Claiming that Orissa was fast emerging as the country’s power hub, Patro said potential buyers for electricity were states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. While the new power generating units were in different stages of implementation, proper planning and coordinated strategy was necessary for erecting the transmission network, he said. Stating that around half-a-dozen new corridors would be needed for the purpose, Patro said strategy for transmission infrastructure was discussed with major players like PGCIL, Central Electricity Authority and NTPC on the initiative of the Grid Corporation of Orissa and the state government. On Orissa’s power demand, he said there was a demand of 2,600 MW of power at present, which was projected to go up to 5,800 MW by 2014 and “even then there will be a huge surplus in view of self-sufficiency achieved."" Describing power tariff in Orissa as among the cheapest in the country, the Minister said it has not been hiked in the last seven years in the state, where 80% of the villages were already electrified. “The aim is to achieve 100% electrification in the next two years,"" he said, adding the Centre’s Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutkaran Yojana and state government’s Biju Kutir Jyoti programme would enable the government to provide electricity in every village. On the possibility of cut in power tariff for the farm sector, he said the government has urged the Electricity Regulatory Commission to reduce the rate and its decision was awaited."
Updated: 25 Sep 2007,PowerGrid&#8217;s Lankan project put on hold,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/MHCOOoE4EEObgO2lf6k86M/PowerGrid8217s-Lankan-project-put-on-hold.html," New Delhi: An ambitious project for supplying power to Sri Lanka using a 200km undersea cable has been put on the back burner because the island nation has so far shown no interest in the proposal. The project is part of an attempt to help enhance economic and political ties between India and Sri Lanka. “There has been no initiative on the part of the Sri Lankan government,"" said a senior Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd (PGCIL) official, who did not wish to be identified. “In such a situation, we cannot do much."" The project was to be implemented by PowerGrid, India’s main power transmission company. It is unclear why the Sri Lankan side has not responded to the proposals. This is not the first time that the project has run into problems. The proposal earlier faced opposition from the Tamil Nadu government as reported by Mint on 14 February. The project hoped to supply 1,000MW power to Sri Lanka, boosting its power situation. Sri Lanka has a total power-generation capacity of only 2,500MW, against India’s capacity of 130,000MW. The India-Sri Lanka transmission link was to run from Madurai in Tamil Nadu to Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka’s north-central province. The transmission project, with a budget of Rs2,000 crore, was to be funded by Sri Lanka, for which PowerGrid has already sent a proposal to the Sri Lankan government. The proposal details how the undersea high-voltage power cable would be laid out. “This situation has two sides to it,"" said Hitul Gutka, an analyst at Mumbai-based India Infoline Ltd. “On the one hand, as the power demand within the country is so high, any excess capacity can easily be absorbed within India. On the other hand, there will be a minor revenue hit on the part of PGCIL as it would have been paid to undertake the work."" The transmission link is not the only project between the two countries. NTPC Ltd has drawn up plans to set up a 500MW coal-based thermal power plant in Sri Lanka as a joint venture project with the Ceylon Electricity Board, involving an investment of $500 million (Rs1,995 crore). Other PSUs such as Indian Oil Corp., which are present in Sri Lanka, plan to increase their presence in that country."
