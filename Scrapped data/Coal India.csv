Updated: 08 Jul 2022,How an Indian cement maker bought Russian coal using yuan,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/exclusive-how-an-indian-cement-maker-bought-russian-coal-using-yuan-11657240560306.html,"An Indian cement maker's recent purchase of Russian coal using yuan involved India's biggest private lender, HDFC Bank, according to an invoice seen by Reuters and a source, as more details emerge of the kind of trade that could blunt Western sanctions against Moscow. There is no suggestion that the purchase, the particulars of which have not previously been reported, in any way breaches sanctions imposed on Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. But the document shows one way in which Russia could continue to sell commodities abroad without settling in U.S. dollars despite restrictions aimed at freezing it out of financial markets. According to the invoice dated June 5 and a source familiar with the matter, HDFC Bank backed cement maker Ultratech's purchase of Russian coal from producer and trader SUEK for 172.7 million yuan ($25.74 million). The letter of credit for the deal was issued by HDFC Bank's Mumbai suburban branch of Andheri East, according to the invoice.  The dollar is the currency of choice for global trade in raw materials, but some traders say the yuan could be increasingly used to settle payments for supplies from Russia.  In the invoice, SUEK requests Ultratech remit the 172.7 million yuan to SUEK's account at the Shanghai branch of China Everbright Bank. SUEK lists the Hong Kong branch of international lender HSBC as the correspondent bank.  A correspondent bank acts as a middleman in the transfer of money from one bank to another. Reuters could not determine if a payment had been received by China Everbright or if HSBC or any other bank was involved in a transfer of funds.  HDFC Bank and HSBC declined to comment. Ultratech, SUEK and China Everbright Bank did not respond to requests for comment. It was not clear from the invoice which currencies were used to effect the yuan payment.  The amount listed was quoted in Chinese yuan and Reuters reported last week that Ultratech imported 157,000 tonnes of coal from Switzerland-registered SUEK and agreed to settle the final payment in that currency. YUAN TRADES STILL RARE For India, such payment methods could become more common as it seeks to maintain trade ties with Russia for commodities including oil and coal without the risk of contravening Western sanctions. India has deep political and security ties with Russia and has refrained from condemning the Ukraine war, which Russia says is a ""special military operation"". India's energy imports from Russia have soared recently as traders, unable to sell into many Western markets, have offered steep discounts. New Delhi defends its purchases of Russian goods, saying they are legal and that a sudden halt would inflate prices further and hurt consumers. Greater use of the yuan to settle payments could help insulate Moscow from punishment and bolster Beijing's push to further internationalise the yuan and chip away at the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global trade. It is, however, still rare for an Indian firm to agree to settle a trade with a non-Chinese company in yuan. In the absence of sanctions, overseas payments to Russian commodity and energy companies would typically be made in dollars via SWIFT to Russian accounts. For Indian trade settlements using the yuan, lenders would potentially send dollars to foreign banks with sufficient yuan reserves, or Chinese banks they have tie-ups with, in exchange for yuan to settle the trade. The invoice mentioned the SWIFT transaction IDs of both HSBC's Hong Kong branch and China Everbright's Shanghai branch. Reuters could not confirm whether any payment was made using the SWIFT platform. SWIFT is a secure messaging system that facilitates rapid cross-border payments, making international trade flow smoothly. Several Russian banks have been cut off from the system in recent months. ""As a matter of policy, SWIFT does not comment on flows between institutions,"" a spokesman said. India's bilateral trade with China, for which companies largely pay in dollars, has flourished even after a deadly military border clash between the two in 2020 that ratcheted up tensions that have still not subsided. New Delhi has increased scrutiny on Chinese investments and imports, and banned some mobile apps over security concerns. The Indian government and the central bank were aware of potential payments for Russian cargo in Chinese yuan, sources told Reuters last week. The government and central bank did not comment for this article."
Updated: 07 Jul 2022,Fossil fuel revenues for India can fall around 65% by 2050: Study,https://www.livemint.com/economy/fossil-fuel-revenues-for-india-can-fall-around-65-by-2050-study-11657184812267.html,"NEW DELHI : The fossil fuel revenues for India can fall around 65% of the 2019 levels by 2050, said a new report by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD). The study suggests that in terms of coal production, India’s revenues can fall around 15%. Titled Boom and Bust: The Fiscal Implications of Fossil Fuel Phase-Out in Six Large Emerging Economies, the report spotlights heavy dependence on fossil fuel revenues in Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China, and South Africa (BRIICS). The economic reliance on fossil fuels puts BRIICS countries at risk of experiencing a substantial revenue gap over the next few decades, as the world transitions from fossil fuel-based energy systems to cleaner energies to limit global warming to 1.5°C. The six emerging economies need to start adjusting their fiscal policies now to account for declining fossil fuel use to avoid a USD 278 billion gap in revenues by 2030. The study finds that by 2050, overall fossil fuel revenues in BRIICS countries could be as much as $570 billion lower than a business-as-usual scenario where governments fail to phase down fossil fuels enough to avoid the worst climate impacts. The widest gaps are expected to occur in India ($178 billion), China ($140 billion), and Russia ($134 billion). The report finds that public revenues from fossil fuel production and consumption currently account for a staggering 34% of general government revenue in Russia, 18% in India, and 16% in Indonesia. The share stands at 8% in Brazil, 6% in South Africa, and 5% in China. “To prevent devastating climate change, the world has to phase out the production and consumption of fossil fuels, which will inevitably erode related revenues. Emerging economies have an enormous opportunity to build more resilient and economically sustainable energy systems as they decarbonize—but they must plan ahead to avoid shortfalls in public revenues that could reverse progress on poverty eradication and economic development,"" says Tara Laan, Senior Associate at IISD and lead author of the report. The economic planning can be done in climate-positive and socially progressive ways, by removing subsidies from—and increasing taxes on—fossil fuels in ways that don’t hurt the poor—like export duties and windfall profits taxes, as imposed by India last week. The IISD experts suggest that the eventual fall in global energy prices will be an opportune time to impose carbon pricing. Diversifying income streams, such as new targeted taxes in the energy and transport sectors will ensure that addiction to fossil fuel revenues does not become a barrier to the reform."
Updated: 06 Jul 2022,India’s coal production rises 33% in June to 67.59 million tonne,https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/indias-coal-production-rises-33-in-june-to-67-59-million-tonne-11657116952195.html,"NEW DELHI : India’s coal production increased by 32.57% to 67.59 million tonne in June 2022 amid anticipation of rising power demand in the country. In June 2021, the domestic coal production was 50.98 million tonne. According to the provisional statistics of the union ministry of coal during June this year, Coal India Ltd (CIL), Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) and captive mines registered a growth of 28.87%, 5.50% and 83.53% by producing 51.56 milion tonne, 5.56 million tonne and 10.47 million tonne, respectively.  Out of the top 37 coal mines as many as 22 mines produced more than 100% and production of another nine mines stood between 80% and 100%, said a statement from the ministry. Last month, coal despatch increased by 20.69% to 75.46 million tonne from 62.53 million tonne in June 2021. During June 2022, CIL and captive mines registered a growth of 15.20% and 88.23% by despatching 58.98 million tonne and 11.05 million tonne respectively. SCCL registered a negative growth of 0.46% during the month. The power utilities despatch has grown by 30.77% to 64.89 million tonne during June this year as compared to 49.62 million tonne in June 21 due to increase in power demand. The statement said that coal based power generation has registered a growth of 26.58% in June 2022 as compared to June 2021. The overall power generation in June 2022 has been 17.73% higher than in June 2021. However, coal-based power generation in the month of June 2022 has been 95,880 million units in comparison to 98,609 million units in May 2022 and registered a negative growth of 2.77%. Total power generation has also decreased in June 2022 to 138,995 million units from 140,059 million units in May 2022 and registered a negative growth of 0.76%. The decrease in power generation on a month-on-month basis comes at a time when power demand has eased with the arrival of the Monsoon rains. The maximum power demand met on 5 June was 190.386 GW and the peak shortage was 2.336 GW. India had registered a record maximum demand met of 210.79 GW on June 9, 2022 and since the power demand has eased. However, going ahead the demand is expected to gain momentum. Union power minister R.K. Singh had recently said that the power demand in the country will continue to rise and is expected to remain above 205 GW. He also said that in order to meet the rising demand, India’s domestic coal production will be increased. The stock of coal at the 173 power plants tracked by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) was at 27.3 million tonne on 5 June, 48% of the required inventory."
Updated: 06 Jul 2022,Coal India hopes to reach wage pact for non-executive workforce soon,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/coal-india-hopes-to-reach-wage-pact-for-non-executive-workforce-soon-11657090153807.html,"The Ministry of Coal has clarified that the government-run coal mining and refining company, Coal India Limited (CIL) is looking to reach a wage pact for its non-executive workforce at the earliest. “Coal India Ltd (CIL) has held five meetings under NCWA – XI so far. The Company aims to conclude the wage pact of its non-executive workforce at the earliest in a mutually agreeable manner,"" as stated in the official press release. CIL maintains amicable and harmonious relations with its Unions and strives to avoid any discordance or strikes in view of the importance of the coal sector in the country. The negotiations are in progress and it usually takes time to conclude the pact. It is pertinent to mention that CIL was the first CPSU in the country to have successfully concluded the previous three wage agreements. Keeping up this tradition, CIL hopes to quickly seal the wage pact this time as well. Meanwhile, a key trade union at Coal India Ltd. has warned workers may strike over delays in finalising salary increases. Talks held July 1 failed to reach any agreement over a pay deal, Bloomberg quoted Sudhir Ghurde, who represented Akhil Bharatiya Khadan Mazdoor Sangh.  Workers are seeking a 47% increase in wages while Coal India has offered a 3% raise.  In August last year, trade unions at Coal India Ltd demanded a 50% increase in workers' wages, company Chairman Pramod Agrawal had said that it would  be difficult for the PSU to give a 50% wage hike to workers due to financial constraints. Tussle over $5 billion wages Coal India’s salary bill was 407 billion rupees ($5.2 billion) in the 12 months ended in March, about 6% higher from the previous year, Bloomberg reported. The company, which is facing higher production costs, spent more than a third of its revenue on salaries. Wages of non-executive workers, which account for 94% of Coal India’s workforce, are revised every five years.. The hike is due from July this year. In 2017, CIL signed a wage agreement with worker unions proposing a 20% hike in salaries for five years. Coal India has a total workforce of 2.59 lakh. Out of this, around 15,000 are executive staff. -With inputs from Agencies  "

Actually, a lot of electricity is required to produce aluminium, and in the Gulf, electricity production using gas is cheaper. But they don’t have bauxite, so they buy alumina from India, which is made from bauxite, and use it to produce aluminium with cheaper electricity and sell it worldwide. Now, they have shown some interest in our plant,"" the official added.        "
Updated: 05 Jul 2022,"Rupee likely to hit 81 against dollar by FY23-end, here's why",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/rupee-likely-to-hit-81-against-dollar-by-fy23-end-here-s-why-11657040292093.html,"The widening of trade deficit to fresh record highs has made a case for further depreciation of the Indian rupee against the dollar. The local currency is seen to reach up to 81 by March 2023 end. On Thursday, the rupee hit a record low of 79.33 against the greenback due to a strong dollar and stubborn foreign funds outflow. As per the latest data, the country's trade deficit touched a fresh record of $25.63 billion in June 2022 widening from $24.3 billion in May 2022. From April to June 2022, the trade deficit stands at $70.25 billion. In June 2022, India's merchandise exports stood at 37.94 billion - taking the total to $116.77 billion in Q1FY23. Meanwhile, the country's imports climbed to $63.58 billion in the month under review and cumulatively stood at $187.02 billion in Q1 of the current fiscal. Analysts Indranil Pan, Radhika Piplani, and Deepthi Mathew at Yes Bank in their Ecologue report said, ""exports moderated for the 3rd consecutive month whereas imports registered a tepid uptick. The uptick in imports was on account of a large increase in oil and coal imports. The positive development was the seasonal moderation in gold imports. Despite the recent pullback in global commodity prices due to increasing concerns around global slowdown, we expect oil prices to remain sticky at higher levels. As such, we expect CAD/GDP at 2.6-3.2% of GDP with oil price averaging at $100-120 per barrel."" At the interbank forex market today, the Indian rupee settled at 79.37 against the dollar. The local unit had touched a lifetime low of 79.38 per dollar during the day. Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst at LKP Securities said, ""Rupee scaled to fresh new lows below 79.35 falling by more than 0.50% amid strong sell off from higher levels in capital markets indicting FII’s still fearful on any rise in equities. Rupee felt the heat with dollar index sharp surge towards 106$ rising 1% compared to last close. As risk sentiment on inflationary pressures continues globally. Rupee range can be seen between 79.05-79.55."" NSDL data showed that FPIs continued to remove their money from the Indian market even in July. So far this month, FPIs' overall outflow stood at ₹7,323 crore from the market (including equity, debt, debt-VRR, and hybrid market). Overall, in the current year, the outflow is around ₹2,34,613 crore. According to Yes Bank's report, the widening of the trade gap to fresh record highs only increases the concern around the strength of India’s external account to withstand such increases. In Q1 FY23, the trade deficit sums to $70 billion, recording an average monthly trade deficit of $23.3 billion. This undoubtedly is the highest in the series so far. A correction below this level is possible on two accounts - if exports pick up or imports reduce substantially. ""With high-frequency global data on production, sales, GDP, sentiment, and consumer confidence indicators already indicating start of global slowdown, it is unlikely that the exports will register stellar growth to offset the downtrend seen in Q1 FY23. On the other hand, India’s oil imports remain relatively inelastic. As such, amid higher oil prices, oil import bill is likely to remain elevated,"" the report said further. Also, the analysts in the report pointed out that the ongoing energy crisis in India does not improve the situation any further. Coal imports are recording fresh series high with each successive print since March 2022. This trend is likely to continue further despite increases in India’s coal production over the last 3-months. ""The start of monsoon season is likely to impact domestic production going forward hence further increase in coal imports is plausible. The government intervention through increase in customs duty on gold by a net 4.24% to 15% could reduce gold imports even as the impact is likely to be marginal, given that gold prices are currently on a downward bias,"" the analysts note said. Yes Bank's analysts in their note stated that they consider 3-scenarios for India’s current account balance with average oil prices at $100 per barrel, $110 per barrel, and $120 per barrel in FY23. The note added, ""Despite some buffer being expected on the invisible inflows, FY23 CAD is likely to be higher at $93-111 bn in FY23 ($47 bn in FY22). As a % of GDP, CAD is likely at 2.6-3.2% in FY23. As such, weakening external balances, increase in FII outflows, decline in import cover, tightening by AEs, is expected to build downward pressure on USDINR."" Hence, the report said, ""we see depreciation bias in USDINR continuing,"" adding ""Our fair price model indicates for an 81.00 level by March 2023."""
Updated: 05 Jul 2022,Trade deficit at a record in June amid rupee slump,https://www.livemint.com/economy/trade-deficit-at-a-record-in-june-amid-rupee-slump-11656958781431.html,"NEW DELHI : India’s trade deficit widened to a record in June, adding further pressure on the Indian currency, which has hit new lows against the dollar in the past weeks. The trade gap, the amount by which the value of a country’s imports exceeds its exports, rose to $25.63 billion in June, led by a surge in coal and oil imports amid soaring global prices, according to official data. Exports touched a four-month low in value terms. The rate of growth slowed sharply as inflation and recession fears in key markets, including the US and the European Union, dampened demand, with engineering goods, drugs and yarn reporting a decline in outbound shipments during last month. Merchandise exports growth slowed for the third straight month in June to touch a four-month low of $37.94 billion, while imports surged by 51% to a record $63.58 billion from a year earlier, preliminary data released by the ministry of commerce and industry showed on Monday. The trade deficit was more than double the $9.37 billion in June last year. The trade data comes days after the government hiked import duty on gold to rein in the widening current account deficit and arrest the rupee’s record decline against the dollar. It also imposed export tariffs on petrol, diesel, and jet fuel besides windfall taxes on crude production to improve domestic supplies and lower the import bill. The rupee ended little changed against the dollar on Monday at 78.94. Economists expect the trade deficit to remain elevated through the fiscal, with the current account deficit expected to widen to more than 3% of GDP in FY23 from 1.2% in the previous year. “With a steady uptick in the size of the merchandise trade deficit over the course of the quarter, we expect the current account deficit to more than double to $30 billion in the first quarter of FY23, from the modest $13 billion in the previous quarter,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist, ICRA. She added that the merchandise trade deficit is estimated to remain more than $20 billion in the remainder of 2022 and the current account deficit in the range of $100-105 billion, which is 3% of GDP in FY23. “However, robust services surpluses will partly absorb the shock,"" added Nayar. Petroleum imports rose 94% in value in June to $20.73 billion from last year. The Centre imposed a cess or windfall tax of ₹23,250 per tonne on crude oil production and a special additional excise duty of ₹6, ₹13, and ₹6 per litre on export of petrol, diesel, and jet fuel, respectively, to ease domestic supplies. Coal imports more than tripled in June to $6.4 billion, crossing the $5.4 billion import bill in May. Gold imports nearly tripled to $2.61 billion in June from a year earlier, even as it was sharply lower sequentially from $6 billion in May. The Centre on Friday hiked the import duty on gold to 15% from 10.75% amid a spike in yellow metal imports, with shipments exceeding 100 tonnes during these months. The non-oil, non- gems and jewellery imports, which signify industrial activity in the economy, grew 31% to $36.7 billion in June, about half of the total imports. Brent crude oil price has been volatile and stood at $111 per barrel on Monday. That compares with $113 in the same time last month, nearly $100 at the beginning of April and $139 in mid-March. As for exports, engineering goods recorded a 1.57% decline in June to $9.19 billion from a year earlier. Drugs exports fell by 1.27% to $1.99 billion, while yarn and handloom exports declined 22.5% to $925 million. Petroleum products, electronic goods, ready-made garments and gems and jewellery recorded a double-digit export growth in June at 98%, 51%, 45%, and 19.4%, respectively."
Updated: 03 Jul 2022,The WTO’s leaky boat may be our best hope in a storm,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/the-wto-s-leaky-boat-may-be-our-best-hope-in-a-storm-11656865986520.html,"Russia’s incursion into Ukraine’s sovereign territory has catalysed a new phase in the extant geo-economic and geopolitical arrangements. While Western academics have been debating whether this new European war spells the end of a liberal regime that defined the world order since the fall of the Berlin Wall (and break-up of the Soviet Union), the Russia-Ukraine conflict has reactivated many fault-lines that lay dormant in the global economy. And, for developing countries like India, multilateral platforms like the World Trade Organization (WTO) hold out the best chance of confronting these challenges, despite the many shortcomings that have hobbled the institution. A food crisis tops the list of phantoms emerging from the ravages of this war; it will rekindle many second order effects that the world had temporarily forgotten, which could include renewed contestation between the West and poor nations, or even civil wars in poverty-stricken nations. One of the reasons for hostilities reviving could be because the notion of trade in the US and EU is still rooted in an outdated economic orthodoxy, even while op-eds in leading newspapers and policy briefs from think-tanks debate the need for a new heterodoxy to replace the now-defunct canon. The WTO’s role has, hence, become non-negotiable, given the severe food crisis confronting the planet. A 6 June report from the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the United Nation’s World Food Programme (WFP), titled Hunger Hotspots, predicts that 20 countries will face a heightened food availability crisis over the next three months. While it is true that Russian aggression has triggered a global food crisis, it is equally true that the world was already facing a food emergency before February 2022. About 2.3 billion people were classified as food insecure during 2021. According to the Global Report on Food Crises, another WFP publication, global hunger levels were alarmingly high in 2021, with “close to 193 million people acutely food insecure and in need of urgent assistance across 53 countries/territories."" The pandemic and climate change amplified the food crisis during 2020 and 2021. The problem is compounded when energy price inflation (which bleeds into fertilizer prices) and fractured supply chains add affordability to availability problems. The food emergency shifted the world’s attention towards India and 29 other countries which banned wheat exports soon after Russia’s war sent grain prices skyrocketing globally. While India may have been compelled to impose an export ban, with wheat production falling short of forecasts and total foodgrain stocks dipping, solutions for the supply of grains to the WFP were actually found at the WTO’s 12th Ministerial Conference, or MC12 held recently in Geneva. India and the others agreed to supply wheat to the WFP, while being allowed to meet their domestic food security needs. The Western media, though, has not stopped pillorying India’s export ban, even though wheat exports during 2021-22 (before the ban was enforced) were only slightly over $2 billion, or a mere 0.5% of the country’s total exports. The Western leadership’s stance at the WTO on agriculture has long undermined India’s attempts to ensure food security for its citizens through subsidies at both the production and consumption stages. The formula being used to determine whether these subsidies are within permissible limits is based on outdated data; all attempts by India and other developing countries to seek a permanent solution have met with repeated filibustering. A drumbeat of protests against India has been revived in a seemingly coordinated move. Seven WTO members—including the US, Japan, the EU and UK—raised concerns over India’s export bans at the trade body’s first agriculture meet after MC12. In parallel, and a seemingly unconnected move, 12 Congressmen have written to US President Joe Biden, requesting him to lodge formal objections at the WTO against India’s trade-distorting agricultural policies. Their letter does not mention anything about the antiquated formula, or how US subsidies could also be trade distorting. There are suspicions, unfounded of course, that these protests are sponsored by large grain traders who now fear that India’s ban may extend to even rice exports, which were worth about $10 billion during 2021-22. It’s not only foodgrains. The duplicity and blinkered vision of rich nations was on full display when many of them stubbornly refused to relax intellectual property rights for global vaccine distribution at the height of the pandemic. These advanced nations decided to put private profit ahead of public health in times of global crisis. And, yet, it was at the MC12 that a solution was hammered out for developing countries to produce and sell patented vaccines, both in the domestic and international markets, even though this comes two years after India and South Africa had first proposed such a covid occasioned relaxation and when the pandemic seems to be on the wane. Some of the trade-related moves against India possibly have their genesis in the Western hemisphere’s disappointment with New Delhi’s stand vis-à-vis Russia’s expansionary moves. An old strategy seems to be re-emerging: continue to court the Indian leadership at plurilateral meetings, but deliver a thousand cuts via diverse platforms, including the media. India’s best chance of resistance may yet lie in creating a coalition of developing nations on multilateral platforms. Rajrishi Singhal is a policy consultant and journalist.

Updated: 01 Jul 2022,Coal India June quarter output hits record,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/coal-india-s-production-hits-record-high-of-160-mt-in-apriljune-11656677937860.html,"Coal India Ltd (CIL), the world’s biggest producer of the fossil fuel, posted record production in the June quarter as it sought to meet strong demand from power plants amid an unprecedented heatwave. The state-run miner produced 159.8 million tonnes (MTs) of coal in the three months ended June, a nearly 29% rise from the 124 MTs produced a year earlier. All units of CIL recorded higher production in Q1. “Such growth was never witnessed in any Q1 since CIL’s inception. Our first quarter production surge of nearly 36 MTs surpassed the entire annual increase of 26.4 MTs of FY22,"" according to a senior official at CIL. The surge in output in the June quarter has reduced the asking growth rate for this fiscal to 8.3%. CIL had earlier placed an asking growth rate of 12.4% to achieve its production aim of 700 MTs for FY23. In June, when the country faced an extremely hot summer, CIL produced 51.6 MTs, up 29% from 40 MTs a year earlier.  Supplies to the power sector scaled a new high of 153.2 MTs during the fiscal first quarter, an increase of 19.8% from 127.9 MTs a year earlier. Coal offtake, or the amount of supplies from coal pitheads, totalled 177.6 MTs during the quarter, a nearly 11% increase from the 160.3 MTs offtake of a year earlier.  In June, supplies to coal-fired plants jumped to 1.713 MTs per day against a projected requirement of 1.6 MTs. This led to 107% materialization. CIL’s offtake to the power sector during the month jumped 27% to 51.4 MTs from 40.4 MTs in June 2021. Higher supplies during the month resulted in coal stock accretion of 77,000 tons per day at power plants.  CIL’s total offtake in June grew 15.4% to 59 MTs from 51.2 MTs last year."

Singh, who was participating in a panel discussion at the BloombergNEF Summit in the national capital, was of the view that instead of talking about phasing out coal-based thermal power plants, India needs to focus on dispatchable renewable energy. ""Why are people too much concerned about coal? Today we are supplying three-fourths of the electricity from coal-based plants. These coal-based power plants are the backbone (of power supply in the country or baseload),"" he said. ALSO READ: NTPC augments coal from own sources ""What we need to look at is how to reduce coal-based generation rather than phase down or phase out coal-based power plants. Let's now talk about that. It is too early to talk about that (phasing out coal-based plants). I think coal (based power) it is going to stay for two to three decades,"" he added. Meanwhile, India has set a target of having 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030. Among other things, the NTPC chief opined that the country needs to make this renewable energy dispatchable and reliable. But, he stressed more on the importance of making affordable and reliant 24X7 power on demand for consumers. ""My concern is that we may have to start new coal-based power plants to meet the requirement,"" Singh said. On way to help reduce fossil fuel-based electricity consumption, Singh suggested the economical solar and wind energy can complement coal-based thermal power during the day. Also, he was of the view of having new efficient and environment-friendly coal-based thermal power plants rather than running old and inefficient ones.

It is also entering the hydro, solar and wind energy segments and aims to have 60 GW of renewable energy capacity in the next decade. With inputs from PTI."
Updated: 22 Jun 2022,Indian legislative processes need a framework for accountability,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indian-legislative-processes-need-a-framework-for-accountability-11655916376168.html,"Afew weeks ago, Rahul Matthan’s ‘Ex Machina’ column in the Views section of this paper underscored the need to redesign the country’s pre-legislative consultation process. A key assumption in the piece was the genial nature of a government that could be expected to adhere to an ideal consultation process. However, as Milton Friedman put it, “The world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests."" This piece proposes a system of accountability in the law-making process itself that monitors the self-interested incentives of the government. A Litany of woes: The Seventeenth Lok Sabha has passed about 150 bills so far. As an approximation, 15 bills have been passed per session. But even as one may applaud such productivity, it has come at the cost of debate and deliberation, two core ideas of democracy that Parliament stands for. Let’s call this the ‘cost to democracy’. A few laws and conventions in our parliamentary system are the key perpetrators. The Executive is an integral part of the Legislature, and thus, when coupled with the anti-defection law, it assumes unfettered control over the Legislature. There were no problems with this arrangement in the era of coalition politics. But it begs us to rethink this system in the face of majority governments. Juxtapose the problem of an over-powerful Executive with this policy prescription from the field of economics: ‘Government intervention comes at a cost.’ The marginal cost of public funds captures this idea: what is the opportunity cost to the economy for additional rupee spent by the government? Empirical estimates, based on a model that compares the inefficiency of government expenditure with the efficiency of private spending, put this figure at about ₹3 in India. Multiplying it by the volume of government spending, the figure would be monstrous. This can be interpreted as a ‘cost to efficiency’ imposed by the state . In the realm of the feasible, can we design an inherent check in our laws that seeks more accountability from the Executive to minimize these two costs? More importantly, can we design a check that is politically palatable? The fix: pre-legislative checks: The Legislation and Expenditure Accountability Bill, 2022 (bit.ly/3zDs98K), which was introduced as a private member’s bill on 1 April 2022 in the Rajya Sabha, attempts a solution. It demands that the Executive think about its actions before going ahead and weed out those interventions that are doing more harm than good to society. The bill goes two steps further than the 2014 Pre-legislative Consultation Policy. First, it is a bill, which means that if it becomes an Act, it will be legally binding on the government. Second, it adds the dimension of a post-legislative check with fail-safe mechanisms. The specifics of the bill revolve around two technical assessments: a legislation impact analysis or LIA (and correspondingly, a scheme impact analysis for public schemes) and a post-implementation assessment (PIA) report. The former is a pre-legislative check and the latter a post-legislative one. These ideas are not novel. Such checks are already in place in mature democracies. The bill’s idea of a legislation impact analysis was drawn from US Executive Order 12291 (bit.ly/3y81eka) of President Ronald Reagan and remodelled for the Indian system. The central principles, however, remain the same: any law or scheme must be based on the principle that its benefits outweigh the costs, and that among the various alternatives available, the chosen one confers maximum net benefits. Based on these principles, the Executive must present to Parliament an LIA (or SIA) for any major legislation (or scheme) to be introduced. This report must offer an assessment of potential costs and benefits to society, an analysis of stakeholders, the objectives of the intervention with clear measurable outcomes, and the experience of other countries, among other things. Post-legislative checks: An accountability mechanism that aims to be comprehensive cannot end there. Even a law commended for its design and intent could see faulty implementation. So this also needs to be accounted for within the frame of the law itself. This warrants that all major laws (or schemes) be evaluated against clear objectives laid out in the LIA (or SIA) by means of a PIA report. The PIA has three aspects: performance measurement, which evaluates schemes and laws against the objectives defined in the LIA; impact assessment, which evaluates qualitative aspects like social, environmental and legal effects and spillovers; and finally, perception surveys that measure people’s satisfaction. All these elements have been borrowed from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development recommendations that the ‘Ex Machina’ article alluded to. Lastly, the bill incorporates a foolproof mechanism to ensure that the accountability mechanism is more than just about presenting reports. As India cannot afford an overhang of outdated legislation that does not improve governance outcomes, the bill requires our laws and schemes to have expiry dates (sunset clauses). Such a provision would grant us an opportunity to re-make laws and schemes, thus ensuring that our nation stays up to date on evolving dynamics of the world. Moreover, if a law or scheme fails its PIA test in three consecutive reviews, it would automatically be repealed. The ideas in this bill all sound good. But we have a simple question: what about its implementation? After all, the bill demands considerable effort by the Executive to undertake proper evaluations of schemes and legislative moves. Hopefully, it can at least lay the groundwork for a new institutional mechanism to ensure self-probity in public expenditure and law-making. It could also serve as a step towards enhancing our national discourse on government intervention.

The state-run coal major on Tuesday said it held three pre-bid meetings with coal agencies showing interest in the three international competitive bidding e-tenders announced recently. “A total of 11 coal importers joined the session with CIL officials. The prominent Indian agencies among them were Adani Enterprises Ltd, Mohit Minerals, and Chettinad Logistics Private Limited. A couple of coal exporting agencies from abroad have also shown interest, including one from Indonesia,"" the company said. The meetings were scheduled to help bidders keen on competing in the process gain a better understanding of the bid document and the scope of work. CIL also said that it has amended the bid document and a corrigendum has been floated on the e-procurement portal. The interested parties had sought amendments, including narrowing the time window of the bid price validity from 90 days to 60 days, it said. Another amendment was fixing the time period for the supply of the first tranche of shipment, from the date of letter of award, between four and six weeks. The supply schedule was earlier based on a percentage of delivery in each of the months of the second quarter of FY23. For the coal that lands on Indian shores, quantity assessment and quality testing shall be done through CIL’s empaneled third-party sampling agencies, it said. CIL had previously floated a short-term indent based international competitive bid to source 2.416 million tonnes of coal from abroad on behalf of state generation companies and independent power plants (IPPs) for blending with domestic coal. Two more medium-term tenders for sourcing 3 million tonnes each at the western and eastern ports of the country were later floated to keep coal on tap for immediate availability and future use. The last date for receipt of bids for the short-term tender is 29 June while that for the medium-term tenders is 5 July. CIL floated the tenders in line in view of the surging power demand and coal shortage at power plants. The stock of coal at the 173 power plants tracked by the Central Electricity Authority was 25.58 million tonnes, which is 38% of the required stock of 66.96 million tonne."

Tata Steel had said in April all its manufacturing sites in India, the UK and the Netherlands had sourced alternative supplies of raw materials to end its dependence on Russia, adding it was taking ""a conscious decision to stop doing business with Russia."" Still, in May, Tata Steel shipped about 75,000 tonnes of PCI coal, used in steelmaking, from Russia's Vanino port, out of which 42,000 tonnes were offloaded in a port in Paradip on May 18 and 32,500 tonnes in Haldia, said the two trade sources who wished to remain anonymous as they were not authorised to speak on the matter. A spokesman for Tata Steel said the deal to import coal from Russia was made before the company's announcement to cut business ties with Russia, without providing further details. ""There has been no other PCI Coal purchase by Tata Steel from Russia after the announcement,"" the spokesman said in an emailed statement to Reuters. India's trade ministry did not respond to an email seeking comment. India has refrained from condemning Russia - with which it has longstanding political ties - over what Moscow describes as its ""special operations"" in Ukraine. India has instead defended its purchase of Russian goods as a bid to diversify supplies and argues that a sudden halt would boost prices and hurt consumers. Tata Steel was the only major steelmaker to announce it would stop doing business with Russia. Other Indian steelmakers have been importing bulk quantities of coal from Russia, trade data reviewed by Reuters showed. The PCI coal was imported in a vessel named Panamax Ostria, the trade sources said. The government source confirmed Tata Steel had imported 75,000 tonnes of coal from Russia in May, but did not give more details. Details on Tata Steel's Russian coal imports have not been previously reported. Purchases of Russian coal by Indian buyers including steelmakers have spiked in recent weeks despite Western sanctions on Moscow, as traders offer discounts of up to 30%, Reuters reported on Saturday.

The company is awaiting certain clearances for its planned integrated greenfield aluminium project in Odisha, two officials aware of the matter said. A government panel chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik had approved the project in December. The company has applied for a bauxite block at Sijimali or Kutrumali in Odisha, and has sought expressions of interest for an equity partner. The officials cited above said on condition of anonymity that no estimated timeline to complete the project can be given at the current stage. Initially, Coal India had planned a joint venture along with National Aluminium Corp. Ltd (NALCO), wherein Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd (MCL), a subsidiary of CIL, will hold 74% and NALCO the rest. Further, alumina and coal for the project was proposed to be supplied by NALCO and MCL, respectively. However, the joint venture plan was dropped last August, following which it was proposed to set up an integrated greenfield aluminium project including bauxite mining, alumina refinery, and an aluminium and associated coal preparation plant. In October, Coal India also approved a pre-feasibility report to set up the integrated greenfield aluminium project by Mahanadi Coalfields. The decarbonization process gained momentum for PSUs following the government’s energy transition push and the net zero carbon emission target by 2070. Stressing on the energy transition and diversification process, Union coal secretary Anil Kumar Jain recently said: “CIL is diversifying; they are getting into coal gasification, they are looking at aluminium...they are looking at non-coal businesses."" Last year, the government floated the National Coal Gasification Mission, and Coal India plans to support gasification of 100 million tonnes of coal by FY30. Furthermore, in its venture into the renewable energy business, the company in April 2021 incorporated CIL Navikarniya Urja Ltd as a subsidiary. Coal India plans to achieve 3,000 MW solar power capacity by FY30. As of 22 January, CIL has installed 8.436 MW of renewable energy capacity. The officials cited above said it will invest in gasification and solar power, but for other diversification projects, it would largely support in terms of infrastructure and land, while much of the capital infusion will be from its partners. “These partners will also bring in the technology required for new businesses,"" one of the two officials said. The state-run major is also participating in pan-India tenders for developing solar power projects and realize its goal of becoming a net-zero energy company."
Updated: 19 Jun 2022,Coal stock at over 52 MT; enough for 24 days' requirement of power plants,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/coal-stock-at-over-52-mt-enough-for-24-days-requirement-of-power-plants-11655639103466.html,"The Centre has said that coal stock at various coal mines in the country is more than 52 million tonnes (MT), which is sufficient for around 24 days' of fuel required for power plants. In addition to it, about 4.5 MT coal stock is available at various goods shed sidings, private washeries and ports and is awaiting to be transported to the power plants. In a statement, the coal ministry said, ""As on 16th June 22, coal stock at different domestic coal mines is more than 52 MT, which is sufficient for about 24 days requirement of power plants."" This comes weeks after shortage of fuel crippled power generation at various power plants in India. Domestic coal production continues to witness an increasing trend in the current financial year as well after a record-breaking coal production of 777 MT in FY22. With increased production, the rake supply from Coal India Ltd (CIL) to power sector has also been at all-time high. The rake loading to power sector increased from 215.8 rakes per day in 2020-21 to 271.9 rakes per day in 2021-22, registering a growth of 26 per cent. In the current fiscal (till June 16, 2022), the rake supply from CIL to power sector has increased by 25 per cent as compared to the same period of last year. At the same time, coal stocks at pit head power plants are much higher than distant plants. The Domestic Coal Based (DCB) power plants have generated a record high power of 3.3 BU per day in June 2022 (till 16th). ""The coal stock at the DCB power plants during this period, however, have not depleted, rather the same has increased from 21.85 MT (as on 01.06.22) to 22.64 MT (as on June 16),"" the statement said. This reflects the robust coal production and sufficient supply to keep up with the increasing demand. The coal stock is sufficient for more than 10 days' requirement. During the monsoons, despite having high coal stock at mine ends, the coal companies face problems in transporting coal to the sidings due to flooding of mines and the wet coal jamming the coal handling plants conveyor systems, it added. Even by the end of second quarter, coal stocks remain high at CIL mines when stocks are low at thermal plant end. There domestic coal production is not an issue. The coal supplies from CIL are more than the FSA requirements. However, CIL has agreed to import coal for the interested power sector consumers (state gencos and IPPs) and have floated a short-term tender for 2.4 MT imported coal for supply within three months and two long-term imported coal supply tenders of 6 MT each for supply over a period of one year, the statement said. The ICB power plants and the gas-based power plants have been operating at very low capacities due to constraints in easy availability of required fuel and issues related to power purchase agreements.  However, coal supplies from CIL and other domestic sources is sufficient to ensure that there is adequate coal at the power plants during the monsoon season."
Updated: 19 Jun 2022,India’s domestic coal production goes up by 28%,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/indias-domestic-coal-production-goes-up-by-28-11655618101553.html,"Following a record-breaking coal production of 777 million tonnes (MT) in 2021-22, India’s domestic coal production has continued to rise in the current financial year. As of May 31, 2022, total domestic coal production in 2022-23 was 137.85 MT, up 28.6% from 104.83 MT in the same period in 2021. This pattern is expected to continue in June 2022. Coal India Ltd (CIL) has increased its coal production by 28% compared to the same period the previous year (as on16th June, 2022). For the current fiscal year, the domestic coal output target is 911 MT, up 17.2 percent over the previous year. In the year 2021-22, coal imports for blending by Domestic Coal Based (DCB) power plants fell to 8.11MT, the lowest level in the last eight years. The robust coal supply from domestic sources and increased domestic coal production made this possible. From 2016-17 to 2019-20, the Imported Coal Based (ICB) power plants imported more than 45 MT of coal every year. However, ICB power plant coal imports fell to the lowest level of 18.89 MT in 2021-22, and generation from these plants fell to 39.82 BU in 2021-22, compared to the 100+ BU that these plants have been generating for quite some time. Due to the high cost of imported coal, their generation has remained low this year as well. Coal-based power generation has expanded at a CAGR of 1.82 percent over the last five years, while domestic coal supply to the power industry has grown at a CAGR of 3.26 percent. As a result, coal supply to the power industry has outperformed expansion in coal-based power generation in recent years and continues to do so this year. The government was gearing up to increase the stock of coal at power plants to 40 million tonne (MT) during the monsoon season, Union power minister R K Singh earlier said. Speaking to PTI, the minister said right now, there are reserves of around 22.9 MT at the power plants. ""On April 1, our reserve stock at power plants was at 24 MT.

As a heatwave bakes broad swaths of South Asia, creating massive power outages, India is experiencing its worst power crisis in almost six years. A jump in air-conditioning demand brought on by this year's unrelenting weather, as well as an economic recovery brought on by the lifting of all COVID-related restrictions on industrial activities, drove power demand to new highs in April. India has been forced to alter a policy of reducing thermal coal imports to zero, and has requested utilities to continue importing for three years as a result of the problem. It also invoked an emergency law to restart generation at all imported coal-fired power plants, many of which have been shut down due to high international coal costs.

The state-run miner is exploring the feasibility of sharply ramping up its underground mining production to 100 million tonnes (MT) by FY30 from 25.6 MT in FY22. Underground mining is minimally invasive on land degradation, the company said. Around 70% of the country’s coal reserves are conducive for underground mining, it said. “The aim is to make underground production sizably supplement the open cast output. At the current rate, mineable coal reserves at existing open cast mines will slowly start coming down,"" CIL said. Land acquisition is a key hurdle in expanding coal mining operations. Eco-friendly technologies are therefore a major advantage as they minimize the need for acquiring land and avoid its degradation, CIL said. The locked-up coal assets left out earlier due to techno-commercial and safety concerns can now be unearthed through these technologies, it said. CIL will introduce 50 continuous mining machines by FY25 with a peak annual production potential of 25 MT. As many as 21 such machines are already deployed in Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL), Central Coalfields Ltd, and South Eastern Coalfields Ltd producing 9 MT a year. Two powered support long wall machines operating in ECL and Bharat Coking Coal Ltd produced 1.58 MTs in FY22 against 1.13 MTs in FY21 posting a 40% growth. Two more such machines with a total capacity of 4.5 MT per year will be soon deployed in BCCL.

In a statement, Coal India said it is exploring ramping up its underground production by four-fold to 100 million tonne by FY2030 from 25.6 MT in FY22. Underground output is environmentally clean, minimally invasive on land degradation, society friendly, it said, adding that around 70% of the country’s coal reserves are conducive for UG mining. “The aim is to make UG production sizably supplement the opencast output. At current rate, mineable coal reserves at existing OC will slowly start lowering,"" said the statement. With land turning out to be a major pain point for expansion of coal mining operations, eco-friendly technologies bypass land acquisition and avoid its degradation, according to Coal India. The locked-up coal assets left out earlier due to techno-commercial and safety concerns can now be unearthed through these technologies. Among mass production technologies, CIL will introduce 50 continuous miners by FY25 with peak production potential of 25 MT per year. 21 such machines are already deployed in Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL), Central Coalfields Limited (CCL) CCL and South Eastern Coalfields Ltd (SECL) producing 9 MT a year. Two powered support long wall (PSLW) machines operating in ECL and Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) produced 1.58 MTs in FY22 against 1.13 MTs in FY21, posting 40% growth. Two more PSLWs with a total capacity of 4.5 MT per year are soon to be deployed in BCCL. In a first, CIL is aiming to mine coal through punch entry in those opencast mines which have reached their ultimate pit level. This could be done through a mix of technologies. CIL plans to identify and implement five such mines through punch entry in phased manner till FY24. So that mineable coal assets can be extracted with economic viability. CIL is planning to deploy 10 high wall machines in its opencast mines during the ongoing fiscal with projected production potential of 5 MT per year. With one such project already operational in SECL three more will soon be functional in ECL. One highwall machine entails a capex of ₹200 crore. Since nationalisation in 1975, underground output contracted by 57.7% till FY22 while opencast production expanded by 8.5 times. The public sector major said that loss incurring production, longer gestation period, lack of skilled labour, unavailability of indigenous equipment, and departmental production cost were reasons for non-adoption of UG mining. “With multiple options available now UG production could become viable,"" it said. Mass production technologies, availability of indigenous manufacturing units and well trained skilled labour would help taking up UG mining. Outsourcing to contractors would scale down the cost of production and Gestation period is also considerably lower now. With these advantages, CIL plans to steadily scale up the locked-up underground coal assets. It also said that ‘paste fill’ technology is yet another environment friendly frontier which involves high speed stowing technology. This will be compatible with mass production technology. In contrast to conventional sand stowing, it uses fly ash to fill the void created by extracting coal from UG mines, which is yet another environmental friendly step. Such system is in advanced stage of implementation in ECL."

Sales of thermal coal to Europe, a market that traditionally offers price premiums, dropped to about 10% to 15% of total exports from 30% before the invasion, according to two executives at Russian coal miners. While Germany is still buying Russian coal, Poland stopped purchases in April, the executives said, asking not to be named because the matter isn’t public. Exports to the region will grind to a halt in August when a European ban on Russian coal shipments takes effect. While Europe looks to South Africa and Australia for alternative supplies, Russia has boosted sales to India, previously a low-volume, low-price market, the executives said. Turkey remains a big buyer. Russia is one of the world’s top three coal exporters, but that’s not been enough to shield its miners from sanctions. Russian steelmakers have also been buffeted by the fallout from the war. By contrast, Russia’s dominance of palladium mining means that shipments have been less impacted, while Moscow is tightening its squeeze on gas flows to underline the dependence of European economies. While Russian coal miners have been forced to seek out discounted markets -- with Japan and South Korea also planning to stop purchases -- the blow has been softened by record prices for the fuel. In coking coal, used in steelmaking, the situation is similar. China more than doubled Russian coking coal imports in April, while Indian shipments are also picking up, ING Group said in report this month. That greater eastward reorientation in Russia’s coal trade is also posing logistical challenges. There are decades-old bottlenecks on rail corridors heading to Asia. While coal previously had priority over other goods, now it’s competing for scarce capacity with iron and steel, the executives said.

Speaking at the India Energy Transition Summit 2022 on Thursday, Singh said power demand in the country will not go back to the pre-covid levels of 160 GW. “Demand is not going to go away; demand will remain at this level and will grow from this level. This is now the new level. It’s not going back to 160 GW; the new baseline is 205 GW and it will go up from there and not come down,"" he said. The statement gains significance at a time of soaring temperatures and elevated power demand across wide swathes of India, and concerns prevail over a possible crisis when power demand reaches a new peak by the end of the month. On 9 June, the maximum power demand met in the country at a record 210.793 GW. The last recorded maximum power demand met stood at 203.078 GW on 15 June. The minister also said that India will continue its efforts to increase coal production in the country. After the crisis in April, the government asked states to increase coal imports and directed Coal India Ltd to issue tenders on behalf of state discoms and independent power producers. Last week, Coal India issued tenders for coal imports of more than 8 million tonnes. With the imported coal coming in, the situation has somewhat eased. However, coal stock at power plants is still low. Power plants tracked by the Central Electricity Authority now have a total stock of 24.4 million tonnes, which is 36% of the required inventory of 66.96 million tonnes. A total of 79 power plants operating on domestic coal, along with eight imported coal-based plants, are running on less than 25% of the required stock, CEA data showed. Talking about the government’s focus on renewable energy, he said: “We have the largest and the fastest growing renewable energy capacity and fastest rate of transition in the world. I am certain that we will be able to sell renewable energy with storage at ₹6.5-7 and there will be demand for round-the-clock renewable energy even at that rate."" The minister also said the government will introduce the Electricity Amendment Bill in the upcoming monsoon session of parliament, which would propose raising of penalties for non-compliance with renewable purchase obligations (RPO). Outlining efforts for higher adoption of renewable energy, Singh said the government will come out with more incentives for green hydrogen. In February, the government came up with the Green Hydrogen Policy and a comprehensive green hydrogen mission is in the making. “We have setup rules for green hydrogen and will come up with further set of sweeteners to make green hydrogen. We plan to achieve for 500 GW by 2030 and by adopting green hydrogen and green ammonia, we can reach 700 GW by 2030,"" he said. Singh, who also holds the portfolio of new and renewable energy, said the government will come up with a separate RPO for wind energy as it is more expensive that solar power."

Coal India, which accounts for over 80% of domestic coal output, floated its maiden tender to import 2.416 million tonnes of coal to build up the stock of fossil fuel at the indigenous power plants, as mandated by the government. The state-run firm also floated two international competitive bidding e-tenders of 3 million tonnes each to source coal from overseas.  April 1, the reserve stock at power plants was at 24 million tonnes and on April 30, it came down to 19 million tonnes and further to 15 million tonnes on May 15, due to a surge in electricity demand. India imported 210 million tonnes of coal in 2021-22, the coal ministry data says. According to the medium-term projections of the coal ministry, of the 186 million tonnes of the fossil fuel that the Coal India is expected to import from overseas in the ongoing fiscal, 130 million tonnes are non-coking coal mainly used as thermal coal for power generation.  The government-run firm will be also importing 56 million tonnes of coking coal in the current financial year, the coal ministry data says.  According to the coal ministry data, the country is likely to import 172 million tonnes of coal in 2024-25, 173 million tonnes in 2027-28, and 170 million tonnes in 2029-30 as against 215 million tonnes of coal in FY'21 and 249 million tonnes of coal in FY'20. India's power demand this year has jumped by a record 40,000-45,000 MW per day as an intense heat wave sweeps through northern parts of the country, the economy expands, and electricity reaches millions of unelectrified homes. India's electricity demand on June 9 was recorded at an all-time high of 2,10,792 megawatts, and 4,712 million units of electricity were consumed.  "

""India has reservations about some of the provisions in the draft decisions and has been engaging in the process of discussions and negotiations in order to be able to preserve the rights under the agreement on agriculture without undermining the existing ministerial mandates,"" the Ministry of Commerce & Industry added. An important issue under negotiation at the WTO relates to the protection of India's food grain procurement programme at Minimum Support Prices (MSP). Such programmes involve the purchase from farmers at administered prices and are key to supporting the farmers and consumers in the country. WTO rules limit the subsidy that can be provided to such products being procured. This issue is being negotiated at the WTO by the G-33 and the African Group which has come together along with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP group) in submitting a proposal on a permanent solution to the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes on 31 May 2022. India co-sponsored a G-33 proposal for a permanent solution on PSH for food security purposes at the WTO, on 15 September 2021, which had the co-sponsorship of 38 Members. In the negotiations, improvements are being sought by developing countries over the ministerial decision adopted at the ninth ministerial conference of the WTO in Bali in December 2013 where members agreed to negotiate a permanent solution on the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes by the 11th Ministerial Conference of the WTO. It was agreed that in the interim, until a permanent solution is reached, Members would exercise due restraint (commonly termed as 'peace clause') in raising disputes in respect of public stockholding programmes for food security purposes instituted before 7th December 2013, even if countries exceeded their permissible limits. Consequent to the firm stand taken by India at the WTO, this peace clause was extended by a decision of the WTO General Council (GC) in November 2014 until a permanent solution was agreed and adopted. Thus, it was ensured that the 'peace clause' would be available in perpetuity. At the Nairobi Ministerial Conference held in December 2015, WTO members agreed to engage constructively to negotiate a permanent solution. India neither wants to link public stock holding (PSH) issue with other agriculture issues nor a work programme as negotiating a permanent solution has a standalone mandate at the WTO, the ministry said.

This follows another tender issued on Thursday to import 2.42 million tonnes of coal for July-September delivery. These two medium-term import tenders of 3 million tonne each of coal have the option of increasing the bid quantity by 100% to 12 million tonne, as per a company statement. Bids have been called for 5,000 GAR (gross as received) thermal grade coal. “The tenders are not indent based but to keep coal on tap for immediate availability and use in future. It is an advance action by CIL in fortifying future supplies and keeping a vendor ready,"" it said. The tenure for placement of order is for a period of one year, beginning July of the ongoing fiscal till June FY23. The minimum indent quantity will be 50,000 tonne, said Coal India. As and when indented by the state gencos and independent power plants, orders will be placed to ship the coal into the country. Delivery of coal would be made within 30 days, from the date of placing the indents. This means delivery at doorstep. For the 6 million tonne of coal sought through competitive bids, nine destination ports have been identified for discharge of the coal, 3 million tonne each at the eastern and western coasts of the country. The estimated value of the work is pegged at ₹3,850 crore for each tranche of 3 million tonne. The last date for submission and opening and the bids received is 5 July. This is the first time Coal India has taken to imports, as the government has directed the company to source coal from abroad given shortages in the country amid soaring demand for power. On 9 June, the maximum power demand met touched a new record of 210.793 GW, with peak shortage at 578 MW. The Centre had nominated Coal India as the nodal agency to augment supplies to state power generating companies and independent power plants (IPPs) through imports at a time when demand is high. The development comes on the back of emphasis by the Union government on import of coal by state gencos for blending in a bid to ensure uninterrupted power supply in the country after the crisis situation faced in April-May. The ministry had on 1 June directed power generation companies to start the process of coal imports by 3 June, failing which they would allocated only 70% of their requirement of domestic coal. Earlier this week, Union power minister R.K. Singh told reporters that almost all states have started the process of importing coal. He said coal stocks in the country have been improving as imports have started to flow in."

This is the second time that an agenda document for the year has been brought out and shared with all senior functionaries who have been given the responsibility of steering these reforms with regular monitoring and appraisals. The idea is to step up the major reforms done in the last few years and give directions for meeting existing and emerging challenges, a coal ministry statement said. The action plan covers the entire gamut of areas for steering the sector into new technologies while focussing on the core competence of increasing production targets. Coking Coal Mission had been launched for increasing coking coal production from 45 million tonnes in 2020-21 to 140 MT by 2029-30 which includes 105 MT from CIL alone. A futuristic agenda will be pursued including coal to chemical, synthesis gas, hydrogen gas, liquid fuels, and chemicals and fertilizers, CIL will diversify its business and explore prospects in sunrise industries, electric charging pods, electric vehicles etc. It will also focus on acquisition and mergers of similar or new business after due diligence, media campaigns and close monitoring of CSR activities."

Updated: 07 Jun 2022,Coal production to be hiked significantly on high power demand: RK Singh,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/coal-production-to-be-hiked-significantly-on-high-power-demand-rk-singh-11654610281050.html,"Union Power Minister RK Singh on Tuesday said the coal production will be hiked significantly to cope up with increased demand. ""On a day-to-day basis, our power demand is 40,000-45,000 MW more than the corresponding day the last year. Energy consumption has gone up from 3,500 million units to 4,500 million units,"" he said. The reserve stocks of coal came down from 24 million tonnes to 19 million tonnes in power plants on 30 April, they were further down to 18.5 million tonnes on 31 May, Singh said, adding that imports have started coming in. India faced its worst power crisis in over six years in April due to higher electricity demand, despite record production by Coal India during the year ended March 2022. Coal India has previously blamed lower output from import-based coal plants, adding that fewer imports put more pressure on domestic mining. Indian officials are rushing to make more coal available for utilities as shortages in the July-September quarter are expected to be 15% wider than intitially estimated due to expectations of higher power demand. The government has rolled back a policy to cut thermal coal imports and plans to reopen closed mines to address rising power demand. Coal accounts for nearly 75% of India's power output and Coal India produces 80% of domestic coal. ""We were power deficit in 2014, but now we have surplus power. At that time, there was a shortage of 13-15% in power supply. We connected the entire country into one grid. Today, we can transfer 1.12 lakh MW of power from one corner of country to another,"" Singh said. ""We constructed 2,900 new substations, upgraded 3,800 substations and added 7.5 lakh new transformers. We achieved the target of having 40% of our established power generation capacity from non-fossil fuels in November 2021."" In order to further accelerate India's ambitious renewable energy programmes, the government has notified Green Open Access Rules today."
Updated: 07 Jun 2022,Moody's says India aims to ramp up coal output to reduce imports,https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/moodys-says-india-aims-to-ramp-up-coal-output-to-reduce-imports-11654595230820.html,"Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday said that large coal-importing countries, including India, is expected to ramp up the output of domestic coal to strengthen energy security and lessen dependence on the import of fossil fuels.  The Centre has recently mandated state-owned Coal India (CIL) to be prepared to import 12 million tonnes (MT) of coal for power utilities for the next 13 months as an emergency measure to avoid a shortage of coal. ""Large coal-importing countries such as China and India will also seek to ramp up domestic coal production to enhance energy security and reduce reliance on coal imports. Chinese coal production surged 15 per cent in March 2022,"" Moody's Investors Service said. CIL aims to increase production by around 12 per cent in the current year, Moody's said. The state-owned firm accounts for more than 80 per cent of the country's coal output. Moody's Investors Service further added that metallurgical and thermal coal prices will remain high, but below recent peaks. However, the supply constraints were easing, it said. Prices for copper, zinc, nickel and aluminium reflect low inventories and supply risk related to Russia. Supply, which was tight even before disruptions from the military conflict, will remain constrained, the agency said. ""Steel and raw material prices have begun to soften as panic buying recedes, supply-chain issues reduce global demand, COVID-related lockdowns reduce consumption in China, and inflationary cost pressures and higher interest rates weigh on sentiment and economic growth,"" it added. Govt making all efforts to avoid reoccurrence of power outages According to industry experts, the government is making all efforts to build up stock of coal to avoid the reoccurrence of power outages, which happened in April on account of shortage of the fossil fuel. On May 18, the Ministry of Power had warned that if orders for coal imports are not placed by May 31, 2022 and the imported fuel does not start arriving at power plants by June 15, the defaulter gencos will have to increase their imports to the extent of 15 per cent. Further, if blending with domestic coal is not started by June 15, then the domestic allocation of the concerned defaulter's thermal power plants will be further reduced by 5 per cent, the ministry had said in a letter to state governments and power generation companies (gencos), including independent power producers (IPPs). In April, Coal Secretary A K Jain had attributed the low coal stocks at power plants to several factors such as heightened power demand due to the boom in the economy post-COVID-19, early arrival of summer, rise in the price of gas and imported coal, and sharp fall in electricity generation by coastal thermal power plants. In April, several parts of the country witnessed power outrages on account of coal shortages. He had said a lot of measures are already underway to enhance the total power supply in the country. Gas-based power generation, which has fallen drastically in the country, has aggravated the crisis, he had said. With agency inputs"

""The company is also aiming at green mining options and planning to increase its underground output,"" CIL's Chairman Pramod Agrawal said. Agrawal's comments come at a time when there have been concerns about global climate change on account of the burning of fossil fuels including coal, resulting into greenhouse gas emission. Coal India, which accounts for more than 80% of the domestic coal output, is setting up coal handling plant/silos in 35 projects under the first phase of the first-mile connectivity, and will continue in the second phase as well for environmentally cleaner transportation of coal. Stating that CIL is committed to preservation of environment and creating a green canopy around its mining areas, the chairman said that the public sector unit planted over 30.4 lakh saplings during FY22, expanding its green cover to 1,468.5 hectares. Agrawal said that 27 eco parks and mine tourism projects have been developed as on date. Satellite surveillance indicates that 76 major open-cast projects have reclaimed 62.5% of excavated area limiting active mining area to 37.5%. For every hectare of land degraded due to mining, CIL created green cover of around 2 hectares of land. Meanwhile, the coal dispatch by CIL to captive power plants and sectors like cement registered a decline in May as compared to the year-ago month. While the fuel supply by CIL to captive power plants dropped 39.74% in May 2022 over the year-ago period, dispatch to the cement sector declined 16.74%, as per the latest government data.

Also, a Project Management Unit has been appointed by Ministry for handholding of allocattees in obtaining the statutory clearances for early operationalization of coal blocks. The government has allocated coal blocks for captive end-use and sale of coal / commercial mining. A total of 85.32 Million Tonnes of coal has been produced in FY22 with 47 operational coal blocks."
Updated: 02 Jun 2022,Coal India to issue two tenders for imports amid looming power crisis,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/coal-india-to-issue-two-tenders-for-imports-amid-looming-power-crisis-11654185607594.html,"State-run Coal India, the world's largest coal miner, will issue a short-term and a medium-term tender next week to import coal, reported news agency Reuters, quoting senior officials of the company.  The short-term tender will seek delivery of imported coal between July and December, while the medium-term tender will demand supplies between July 2022 to June 2023. The tenders will be placed on a business-to-business (B2B) basis, as government-to-government (G2G) imports - suggested by the power ministry last week - would delay the process, according to the official.  The central government had asked the miner to place orders for shipments from overseas last week. The deadline for states to submit their requirements to the power ministry had been extended to 3 June from 31 May. Utilities had suggested that multiple tenders would lead to confusion and sought centralised procurement through Coal India. It would be the first time since 2015 that Coal India has imported the fuel. India has rolled back a policy to cut thermal coal imports and plans to reopen closed mines to address rising power demand.  India faced its worst power crisis in over six years in April due to higher electricity demand, despite record production by Coal India during the year ended March 2022. Coal accounts for nearly 75% of India's power output and Coal India produces 80% of domestic coal. Coal India has previously blamed lower output from import-based coal plants, adding that fewer imports put more pressure on domestic mining. Fear of another power crisis The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) in its latest report has said that India will likely face another power crisis in July-August due to a lower pre-monsoon coal stock at thermal power plants. ""The data compiled from official sources suggest that the coal power plants are in no position to address even a minor spike in the power demand and there is a need to plan for coal transportation well in advance,"" said the independent research agency in a report titled 'Failure to load: India's power crisis is a coal management crisis'. It said that the onset of the southwest monsoon will further hamper mining and transportation of coal from mines to power stations. ""If coal stocks are not replenished to adequate levels before monsoon, the country might be heading towards yet another power crisis in July-August 2022,"" said CREA.    "
Updated: 01 Jun 2022,Record renewable energy output helps India ease coal shortage in May,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/record-renewable-energy-output-helps-india-ease-coal-shortage-in-may-11654094764031.html,"Record green energy output reduced Indian dependence on coal in May, despite 23.5% growth in power demand, contributing to a rise in utilities' coal inventories, a Reuters analysis of government data showed. Surging supply from renewables will go some way towards mitigating India's coal shortage amid extraordinarily rapid growth in demand, which has forced the country to reopen mines and return to importing the fuel. The share of renewable energy sources in power output rose to 14.1% in May from 10.2% in April. Coal made room for it, dropping to 72.4% of Indian generation from 76.8%. Coal's share was still higher than 70.9% in May 2021, however. Power shortages, driven entirely by demand and not declines in supply, narrowed to 0.4% of requirements in May. This compared with 1.8% in April, an analysis of daily load despatch data from federal grid regulator POSOCO showed. Demand in the financial year to March 2023 is expected to grow at the fastest pace in at least 38 years. Utilities' coal inventories at the end of April were at their lowest levels in years, but they rose 6.3% in May to 23.3 million tonnes, helped by renewables stepping up to carry more of the national electricity load. Climate activists have blamed a delay in installation of renewable energy capacity for the April power shortfalls, the worst electricity crisis in more than six years. India, the world's third-largest greenhouse gas emitter, is 37% short of its target for end-2022 green electricity capacity. Electricity demand in May was 23.5% higher than in the same month last year and up 11.9% on May 2019, the data showed. Wind energy generation, which typically picks up from May and tapers in August, was 51.1% higher in May than a year before, while solar power output increased 37.8%, the data showed. Generation from all renewable sources rose 44.1% from a year before, the fastest pace in at least 30 months. Analysts say the respite from power cuts in May is temporary and India's power crisis is unlikely to be resolved soon. India faced its worst power cuts in over six years in April. ""Officials also know very well that monsoons impact mining and transport. Yet, no preemptive action was taken to resolve this crisis,"" the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) said in a note last month. ""A lower pre-monsoon coal stock at power stations indicates the possibility of another power crisis in July-August 2022,"" the CREA said. Because demand peaks during the daytime, higher generation from solar, India's main renewable energy source, is particularly important for easing the strain on an ageing fleet of coal-fired power stations. It also conserves coal for night-time generation and reduces pressure on the rail network.   This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.
