Updated: 26 May 2021,ICICI Prulife’s steady climb in valuations may sustain on growth efforts,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/icici-prulife-s-steady-climb-in-valuations-may-sustain-on-growth-efforts-11622010595264.html,"MUMBAI: Investors of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Ltd have had a lot to cheer for over the past few months and gains in the company's shares reflect this. As such, analysts have noted the modest valuations and held to their buy ratings on the stock. The insurance company added 110 new partners in the March quarter to boost business growth. Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd point out that the company may benefit immensely from its bancassurance partners. But there is another, albeit smaller, push that could benefit ICICI Prulife’s growth. Its banking partners have also grown their deposit base sharply. In fact, deposit growth for banks have been faster in the March quarter. With deposits coming in droves, banks have begun to cut deposit rates. Jefferies points out that this may redirect funds into traditional insurance plans. “Even as the cut in deposit rates primarily reflects the strengthening of their deposit franchise, we believe that it will have a positive rub-off for cross-sell of financial products, especially where returns are guaranteed (like non-par products and annuities) as well as other traditional products like PAR,"" said a note from the brokerage. ICICI Prulife’s bancassurance partners too have announced deposit rate cuts. Considering that they hawk the life insurer’s products, the drop in their deposit rates and the availability of insurance plans on the counter could direct flows into these plans easily. “We understand that these platforms collectively had originated about Rs6-7 billion ( ₹600-700 crore) of annualised new premiums over past year and targets would be to double this in the next 3 years or so, with ICICI Pru Life being a key beneficiary,"" the Jefferies note points out. The bancasurrance channel contributed 42% of the insurer’s annualised premium equivalent (APE) in FY21 and remains the strongest distribution channel. ICICI Prulife has had a tough two years when the company saw its business growth plummet. The pandemic had increased challenges with APE showing a contraction of 12% in FY21. However, the company’s efforts to regain growth has have been appreciated by investors. The fact that its shares trade at a far lower valuation multiple compared with its peers HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd and SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd also works in its favour. The stock trades at a multiple of 2.3 times its estimated embedded value for FY22, cheaper than the multiple of 4.3 for HDFC Life and 2.5 for SBI Life."

Updated: 10 Sep 2020,Investors choose HDFC Life over peers but valuations cause worry,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/why-investors-seem-to-prefer-hdfc-life-among-life-insurers-11599734518910.html,"Shares of HDFC Life Insurance Ltd have recovered smartly since the lockdown was lifted, and are now only 5% lower compared to the pre-covid highs. This compares with a 15-16% drop in shares of other private life insurers such as SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Ltd. What is behind the warmth of investors towards HDFC Life Insurance? To begin with, the private sector life insurer was on a strong footing even before the covid-19 pandemic hit in late March. The company’s FY20 performance was superior to its peers. Profitability indicators, such as value of new business growth and value of new business margin, trumped competitors consistently. For instance, HDFC Life’s value of new business margin was 25.9% for FY20 as against 18.7% for SBI Life and 21.7% for ICICI Prudential Life. Performance for the June quarter showed the impact of the lockdown. But HDFC Life managed to keep profitability metrics from eroding too much. Despite a 33% contraction in new business premium, the insurer kept its margins at 24.1%. Peers ICICI Prudential Life and SBI Life saw a sharper contraction in new business. To be sure, data from the sector regulator shows that HDFC Life has fared far better than peers in recovering from the pandemic’s blow.  The bounce back in new business premium in July and August has resulted in narrowing the decline in business for HDFC Life. On an annualized premium equivalent (APE) basis, the contraction in HDFC Life’s business was just 5% for the first five months of FY21. For SBI Life, the contraction was 19% and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance saw a decline of 40%. While it may seem to justify the valuations, some analysts said the shares may have turned pricey. Edelweiss Securities has kept its rating of reduce on the stock. “Valuations at 4.4 times price to embedded value for FY22 are due to a legacy of higher margin/growth compared to competition, along with brand benefits,"" wrote Edelweiss analysts in a note. A big concern for analysts is the potential moderation in the protection business, which has been a large contributor to margins for HDFC Life. Kotak Institutional Equities has said the increase in ratio of sum-assured to premium payout and the rise in average ticket size indicate that growth in simple term plans may be moderating, relative to that of other traditional products. This is a trend observed for most private sector insurers, but HDFC Life has been at the forefront of pushing protection plans. Besides, even those protection plans bundled with loans may see weak demand, analysts added. Since the protection plans are margin-friendly, this could weigh on them. Nevertheless, HDFC Life’s sustained recovery is its best ally in keeping investors interested. So far, the insurer has given little reason to doubt its revival trajectory."

Updated: 01 Nov 2017,SBI Life Insurance needs to cruise beyond the expected for valuation pop,https://www.livemint.com/Money/mqDsUiXSh0ACfucryVw5JM/SBI-Life-Insurance-needs-to-cruise-beyond-the-expected-for-v.html," Insurance company shares haven’t been doing well ever since insurers began to list on the bourses and SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd’s stock is no exception. The stock gained over 1% on Tuesday but is still 9.7% down from its list price of Rs733. The tepid performance of SBI Life’s stock was partly because the IPO (initial public offering) price of Rs700 was rich at a valuation of four times its estimated embedded value for fiscal year 2018 (FY18). The company’s embedded value has grown a decent 9.33% for the first six months of FY18. Given that the second half of a fiscal year is typically stronger for life insurers, SBI Life’s strong growth in most of its metrics augurs well for it. The largest private sector insurer reported 37.4% growth in its new business annualized premium equivalent that drove the 20.6% growth in assets under management (AUM). Of course, the growth in new business premium came primarily through individual premium, in line with the company’s historic performance. For all the growth, SBI Life managed to keep its costs under check. The total cost ratio rose marginally to 13.3% from 12.9% a year ago. Its operating expenses ratio reduced to 8.6% from 9.4%. Such a good set of numbers should indeed please investors but for an insurer that has a grand advantage over its peers in access of a physical network as well as an established pedigree, strong growth is a given. The AUM growth of 20% is kind of assured since the insurer has the largest branch network of State Bank of India (SBI) at its disposal to hawk its policies. It also has tie-ups with other agencies, besides having a network of its own agents. Data from the insurance regulator shows that SBI Life’s premiums have been increasing, partly driven by a rise in ticket size. This means that the insurer is seeing fast growth in its market-linked policies. Indeed, the share of market-linked products is 49% of new business premium and such products get a boost owing to stock indices surging ahead. Also, the number of policies it sold in August was down, showed the data. SBI Life hasn’t gone beyond the expected in its growth story and that perhaps explains why the stock has underperformed since listing. The management has said that penetration of its policies is low when juxtaposed with its parent’s customer base. For it to command higher valuation, the insurer can start with picking these low-hanging fruits of growth."

Embedded value represents the present value of all future profits from the existing business plus shareholders’ net worth. For SBI Life, its EV stands at Rs12,999 crore. For the quarter the insurer also grew by 78% in its new premium and reported a growth in profits by 6%. Arijit Basu, managing director and chief executive officer, SBI Life Insurance Co Ltd, talks about why the company declared the EV now and the story behind the growth numbers.  Other insurers declared their EV earlier, why did it take you so long?  Embedded value (EV) is not a mandatory requirement by the regulator and so far it was the analysts that were interested in the embedded value. This is why you saw companies disclosing their EV around the time of foreign direct investment (FDI) hike announcement. We were also told by analysts to disclose EV and non-disclosure meant they were uncertain about our business. We also felt that this would be in line with best practices. So we decided to disclose our embedded value.   You will be going public soon. Will it be an offer for sale where the stakeholders divest their stake or will you raise capital for the company?  In terms of divesting a stake, SBI has already decided to divest 10% of its stake to our foreign partner BNP Paribas Cardif. We will go public in a couple of years to raise capital. We haven’t taken capital from our shareholders since 2008 and so far have managed on accrued profits. But we are growing at a rate of 40% per annum and we will need capital in a year or two to sustain this growth. For the quarter our individual new business premium grew by 69%, whereas the industry grew only at 16%.  Is the growth primarily because of the bancassurance channel? Even our retail agency channel is doing a good job. Our agency is growing at 34% and the average premium sold is about ₹ 2.2 lakh per year whereas the industry average is about ₹ 80,000. We put a lot of effort in training and focusing on agents’ persistency. We have targeted a persistency ratio of 80% for our agents. We believe persistency is very important because that is where the profits come from. The new business premium goes into meeting all the expenses so it’s actually the renewals that generate profits. In terms of bancassurance, yes, our branch activation levels are high but it is still not the maximum. Currently, only 40% of SBI branches sell insurance. But I feel our bancassurance model is the most cost-efficient. We don’t have our staff in all the branches. Our staff to bank ratio is 1:40, which means one person from our company is assisting bank-specified persons in 40 branches with sale. Other companies have one staff member in every branch, which only increases the costs. Only in the 300 top branches do we have one staff member per branch.  Irdai has issued a discussion paper on directing insurance companies to go public after completing 10 years of operation. This will enhance disclosures. How do you think the industry will cope?  In terms of disclosures, all companies disclose financials and certain analytical ratios as mandated by Irdai in its annual reports. But once insurers decide to list, there will be greater emphasis on disclosures. While this is not a concern for older and bigger insurance companies, for younger companies disclosures will be a concern. They will first need to get their house in order, otherwise they will not get a good valuation. So making this a mandatory condition may not be suitable. For us, listing will ensure better governance.   Consolidation has begun with HDFC Life merging with Max Life. Will consolidation pick up? Will you look at mergers?  You may see consolidation happening as one strong company may look to merge with a middle-level company. But we are not looking at mergers because I am not looking at inorganic growth. We are growing faster than any insurance company and if we sustain the growth, we should be number one in the next few years. Consolidation doesn’t really bring growth because there is nothing that you are doing differently. Both the insurers would have been doing the same things in terms of products and distribution.  While in terms of total new business premium you have grown by 78%, your profits have grown by only 6% for the quarter. The growth doesn’t seem to translating into profits. Is it also because profits in the industry have come down as the profits from lapsed bucket have reduced? Slow profits are more a reflection of growth. Yes, there was a time when lapsed profits formed a sizeable chunk of the profits, but the situation has changed over time. The costs in life insurance are recovered in the first year from the first-year premium, causing a new business strain on the company. So a company that’s growing fast will show a new business strain and this will have a negative impact on profits, even though the impact on value for the company is positive. The strain is mitigated by renewal premiums. In our case, our renewal premiums are growing at 20% and as persistency improves further, our renewal book will become more sizeable.  Irdai has allowed an open architecture in bancassurance, but there aren’t many takers. What is the view of SBI on this?  The option of an open architecture was given sometime back, so it’s still very nascent. SBI feels that cross selling or selling third party products is still at a very nascent stage. 60% of SBI’s bank branches don’t sell insurance so that’s the immediate challenge first. Cross selling is very important for customer acquisition and retention. Customer typically need eight set of financial products that include insurance as well and unless the bank can get all the branches to cross sell, opening it up is not right. There is no aversion to an open architecture but now is not the time, it will perhaps happen 2-3 years down the line. "
