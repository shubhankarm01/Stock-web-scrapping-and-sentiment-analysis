Updated: 05 Jul 2022,IT services firms likely to report strong revenue in Q1,https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/it-services-firms-likely-to-report-strong-revenue-in-q1-11657042305039.html,"BENGALURU :   Top Indian IT services companies are expected to report strong revenue growth of 2.3-4.3% quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q) in constant currency during the fiscal first quarter ended June, according to analysts. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) will kick off the earnings season on Friday. However, the peak revenue growth of these companies is likely to be behind them and the momentum is expected to start softening from H2 FY23 due to absence of large deal wins and clients postponing their technology spends. While the long-term demand environment remains unaltered, elevated inflation and an economic slowdown in the US and Europe is likely to impede growth in the second half of the fiscal. “We anticipate Infosys to lead on organic revenue front with growth of 4.3% QoQ in constant currency, followed by TCS at 3.6% QoQ in constant currency. Growth in Tech Mahindra, Wipro and HCL Technologies is expected to be soft due to seasonal weakness and moderation in demand,"" ICICI Securities said in a pre-earnings note. Margins are likely to be under pressure due to wage hikes, higher backfilling costs, increase in travel/visa/other discretionary costs with the easing of travel restrictions, and back-to-office trends, said Emkay Research. “Due to cross-currency headwinds, benefits from rupee depreciation will be marginal in Q1."" The brokerage firm expects Infosys to retain its annual revenue growth guidance of 13-15% in constant currency and EBIT margin guidance of 21-23% for FY23. HCL Technologies is also likely to retain its 12-14% revenue growth and 18-20% EBIT margin guidance range. Wipro should guide for a 2.5-4.5% sequential growth in constant currency with Rizing adding about 1% incrementally for Q2 FY23. In the absence of large deal wins, smaller deals will drive deal intake in the June quarter. “ACV (annual contract value) of signed deals to remain strong. We expect the deal intake to remain healthy across companies in Q1, with an uptick in smaller deals (led by clients’ urgency to execute digital transformation deals quickly) driven by increased demand for cloud adoption, digital transformation and customer experience transformation deals,"" Emkay Research said."

Atos will oversee the legacy business, which ended with €5.4 billion in revenue last year while the fast-growing, digital business, with €4.9 billion in revenue will be clubbed under a new company, Evidian. Atos is not the first technology services firm that has been forced to restructure its business.

Updated: 28 Jun 2022,Wipro Consumer slashes ad spending as price rise bites,https://www.livemint.com/industry/advertising/wipro-consumer-slashes-ad-spending-as-price-rise-bites-11656351446430.html,"NEW DELHI : Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting, maker of Santoor soaps and Yardley talcum powder, has reduced advertising spends and is reviewing raw material procurement, as inflation in commodities such as palm oil raise costs. “We’ve not cut down on trade promotions. We have definitely cut down on advertising spends both for Q4 (FY22) and Q1 (FY23) when the inflationary effects have happened,"" Vineet Agrawal, CEO, Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting said in a virtual interview. “I think as far as consumer offers or trade offers are concerned, that’s something we have not cut down on because consumers were looking at value in these times. So, that’s something that we might have done marginally, we but have not really cut down on that,"" Agrawal said. The company, which clocked over ₹8,630 crore in revenue in FY22, however, said inflationary pressures may recede over the next few quarters. The company could “step up advertising spends if commodity prices show signs of easing"", Agrawal said. Wipro raised prices of its flagship Santoor soap brand by 8.5% in the July quarter, taking the 100 gram pack from ₹35 to ₹38. Between September and May, palm oil prices moved up 50%, said Agrawal, though it has seen some correction since. “I just hope that in the next two quarters, unless something changes dramatically and with cooling down of commodities, we can manage without any price hikes,"" he said. Battling record levels of inflation, FMCG firms have been resorting to price increases as well as grammage cuts across brands. Agrawal said the company will have to focus on better procurement and review the formulations to avoid cost increases as much as possible. “Procurement and formulations become very, very critical in this inflationary environment so that one can avoid cost increases as much as possible,"" he said. “In soaps, we would have seven to eight formulations—which doesn’t impact the final outcome of the product. So, we’ll switch, let’s say, between coconut oil and palm oil to ensure that we can have a little bit of cost advantage. In every product category that we have, we look at various alternate formulations,"" he said. Higher prices of everything from fuel to food are also hurting household demand. In the July quarter, the company reported “very flat"" to a marginal growth in domestic volumes compared to the year-ago period. On Monday, analysts at ICICI Securities said FMCG volume growth could turn positive in the second half of FY23. In May and June, business picked up for the company that sells personal wash products, toiletries, facial care products, wellness products and home care products. The urban business grew ahead of rural, it said. “March and April were definitely tougher than May and June. In May and June, we definitely saw demand improving. However, I would say rural demand is still a tough situation. As a company, we are more dependent on the rural market. Our market shares are higher and distribution is much more strong in rural. Our interest would be that rural picks up as fast as possible,"" he said. The company draws 48% of its business from India."

Mutual fund calculator: Investing in small-cap funds for long term is advisable as it gives higher return than medium and large-cap funds. This because small-cap funds mainly invest in small-cap stocks that rise or dip faster than medium and large-cap stocks. However, when the market is available at discounted price, SIP in small-cap mutual funds may help an investor to get stellar return in small time. Canara Robeco Small Cap Fund - Direct Plan is a glaring example of it. It has given stellar 31.35 per cent annual return over three years beating category return of 22.35 per cent per annum in this period.

High informal share (~more than 60%) in the industry and expected growth outlook inline with the economy, keep the long-term growth prospects intact for gold loan industry. Inherent strength of branch network and established brands provide strength to incumbents. However, intense competition (especially in H2FY22) has led to lower yields and declining RoEs. The change in profitability outlook has led to lower valuation multiples. As a result, current 1-year forward P/B multiple for Muthoot/Manappuram have declined to 1.8x/0.7x respectively (vs 5-year and 10-year average of 2.2x/1.7x and 1.8x/1.4x, respectively). Our channel checks indicate some systemic improvement in yields for gold loan players and also some signs of stress for new competitors. Rising interest rates and improvement in competitive intensity can improve profits ahead.

Technically speaking, the index has witnessed a positive crossover from the oversold region of the RSI, leading to a short-term reversal. Even the strong bullish candle on the daily chart construes to be an encouraging sign for the bulls, as the Nifty tested the historical support zone of the 15700. On the front of the level, the unfilled gap of 15380-15420 is expected to cushion any minor correction, while the 15180-15200 zone withholds the sacrosanct zone for the index. On the contrary, the 15750 zone is likely to act as a stiff resistance, followed by the sturdy wall of the unfilled gap starting from the 15900 odd level. Hence, looking at the recent developments, the market is expected to hover within the mentioned zone until any decisive breakthrough does not take place. Meanwhile, global markets also need to be on a close radar as they might act as catalysts with their developments. We advocate having a pragmatic approach in the market by focusing more on the beaten-up frontline counters for the time being.   The rupee depreciated 4 paise to 78.17 against the US dollar in opening trade on Wednesday, tracking a muted trend in the domestic equity market and a firm American dollar.

The average US retail price for the fuel topped $5 a gallon this month after surging more than 50% in 2022. Oil is headed for a ninth straight quarterly gain as the fallout from the war in Ukraine and increased consumption offset concerns about a broad economic slowdown. Supermajor Exxon Mobil Corp. warned this week that crude markets may remain tight for another three to five years, while Vitol Group, the world’s largest independent oil trader, has flagged rising fuel demand in China.   The Federal Reserve will deliver another 75-basis-point interest rate hike in July, followed by a half-percentage-point rise in September, and won't scale back to quarter-percentage-point moves until November at the earliest, according to economists polled by Reuters. Last week the Fed hiked the federal funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, its largest rate increase since 1994, after official data just a few days earlier showed inflation unexpectedly rose despite expectations it had peaked. The latest poll results, released on Wednesday before Fed Chair Jerome Powell was due to appear before the Senate Banking Committee as part of his twice-yearly monetary policy testimony to Congress, show momentum is still behind the U.S. central bank doing more, not less, despite rising recession concerns and a steep sell-off in financial markets. Bond yields are up sharply and major Wall Street equity indexes are already trading in a bear market, defined as 20% down from their peak. In the June 17-21 Reuters poll, nearly three-quarters of economists, 67 of 91, expected another 75-basis-point U.S. rate hike in July. That would take the fed funds rate to a range of 2.25%-2.50%, roughly the neutral level where the Fed estimates the economy is neither stimulated nor restricted.   Stocks finished broadly higher on Wall Street Tuesday, clawing back some of the ground they lost in their worst weekly drop since the beginning of the pandemic. The rally to start the holiday-shortened week came as investors look ahead to what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will tell Congress on Wednesday, the first of two days of testimony as part of the central bank’s semi-annual monetary policy report. Last week, the Fed hiked its key short-term interest rate by the most since 1994, the central bank’s latest effort to tame the worst inflation in 40 years. The S&P 500 rose 2.4%, recouping about 40% of its losses last week. More than 85% of the stocks in the benchmark index gained ground. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.1% and the Nasdaq climbed 2.5%.  "

Last year, Eicher Motors Ltd witnessed an institutional investor revolt against giving a 10% raise to managing director Siddhartha Lal. India’s largest technology services companies are not among the companies that face this challenge. At six of the largest IT services firms, not a single resolution regarding CEO compensation has seen any major dissent by public shareholders over the last decade, according to filings reviewed by Twich+. This is not to conclude that all is well, but we’ll come to it in a bit. The simple point is the chief executives at the largest IT services companies are not overpaid. At Infosys Ltd, Salil Parekh earned ₹71.2 crore last year, while his friend and former Capgemini colleague, Thierry Delaporte, made ₹79.8 crore at Wipro.                   "

They said that the stock is in ₹440 to ₹470 range and can go down to ₹ ₹400 to ₹380 after the breakdown. Speaking on Wipro share price outlook, Tirthankar Das, Head of Technical Research at Ashika Group said, ""Wipro share price continues to remain in downtrend forming lower low and is on the verge of breakdown below previous low, signaling further downsides in coming sessions at the breach of 440 levels. However, Wipro is near a falling trendline support in prices and a positive divergence in RSI in the daily time frame are indicating of a bullish reversal in prices. RSI presently trading above 30 mark and inside the Bollinger Band indicating of a possible turnaround in prices. To add further the level of 440-450 coincides with 50% retracement of the entire rally since Mar’20."" Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking said, ""Wipro share price is in range of ₹440 to ₹470 and it may go down to ₹410 to ₹400 in near term after breakdown. The overall trend of the stock is down as well. So, one should avoid buying at current levels and wait for the stock to stabilize after the breakdown. The stock may become bullish after it breached the hurdle placed at ₹470 and sustains above this level on closing basis."" On suggestion to those who want to buy Wipro shares, Tirthankar Das of Ashika Group said, ""A sustained close above 475 can accelerate the pullback towards ₹510 to ₹525. For Investors, it would be advisable to show patience as trend clearly remains in favour of the bears and lower level of ₹380 to ₹400 can be seen in near term.""

Over this period, global markets, especially technology stocks, have also corrected sharply. The stock price correction has largely been due to the derating of valuation multiples, as earnings estimates have mostly remained intact or seen minor downgrades.  Brokerage house PhillipCapital believes that a CYTD correction in stock prices, more than factors in the concerns. It foresees a reversal in these stocks soon, and expects handsome returns from current levels. The brokerage has remained positive on the Indian IT sector and maintained Buy ratings on Mphasis (target price of ₹3,560), Mindtree (TP: ₹4,300), Persistent Systems (TP: ₹4,330), LTI (TP: ₹5,400), Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) with target price of ₹4,270 and Infosys (TP: ₹1,930) as its top stock picks.

The IT sector has corrected significantly over the past five months. Most stocks have given up almost the entire gains that they had made in the second half of CY21, which were boosted by recurring higher-than-expected earnings and a bright outlook.  “Strange and unrelated as it might seem, markets have painted the IT services companies with the same brush as technology stocks – resulting in a high correlation between the Nifty IT Index and the Nasdaq Index. In fact, both have traversed the exact same path in the last five months,"" the note stated. ""While the global macro fears are for real, we believe their impact on earnings will be minimal and temporary. The demand outlook continues to be super-bullish – by Gartner, ISG, Accenture and Infosys/HCL (in their recent analyst meets). The commentary on tech spending by major BFSI and retail players (two major verticals for Indian IT) also remains strong, despite macro concerns,"" PhillipCapital added.

Day trading guide for stock market today Speaking on day trading strategy in regard to Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said, ""The near term uptrend status of Nifty remains intact and there is no sign of any reversal yet from the highs. Further weakness from current levels could find strong support around 16,400 to 16,350 levels and the Nifty could show upside bounce from the lower levels. Sustainable upside move of NSE Nifty could only resume above the hurdle of 16,800 levels."" Advising investors to avoid aggressive buying, Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com said, ""The divergence after the recent rally of 1000 points indicates limited upside for the time being, and hence we could see the market resuming its corrective phase. Hence, we advise traders to avoid aggressive buying as an up move led by few sectors or stocks is not a good sign."" He said that traders should also be vigilant on the global markets and the US Dollar index which has shown signs of an up move again after the recent corrective phase. Since our markets have recently seen high negative correlation with this index, any upside move in this index could be a factor to worry for.

Updated: 25 May 2022,India puts 'new reality' on display with Davos street show,https://www.livemint.com/news/world/india-puts-new-reality-on-display-with-davos-street-show-11653487402332.html,"DAVOS : Bright colours and bold logos proudly signal where India has set up base on the main street in Davos this year, as the country trumpets its pro-business and foreign investment drive. Inside a pavilion on the Swiss Alpine resort's Promenade street beneath an ""India @ Davos 2022"" logo, the federal government served up treats including 'masala chai' tea, 'samosa' snacks and other spicy delicacies. Clustered around it are six Indian states with their own lounges, housed in what are usually high street shops. ""It's an Indian street, it should be called 'Little India'. It shows the country is open for investments,"" said Samir Saran of India's Observer Research Foundation. Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told Reuters that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had suggested bringing states together to showcase unity at the gathering of business and political leaders at the World Economic Forum. ""Investors love this kind of a messaging,"" Goyal said. While India has long had a presence at the World Economic Forum, several officials and attendees from Asia's third-largest economy said it was not previously so prominent. At the government's base, food was being prepared by a team of 15 chefs who were flown in from India, along with 450 kilograms of vegetables and local spices, head chef Guru Nathan told Reuters, as people enjoyed a fragrant morning buffet. ""We were asked to keep the spice moderate so that everyone can enjoy (the food),"" Nathan said. Only a few steps down the road, Indian tech giants Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies have set up their bases close to those of Alphabet's Google, Meta and Intel. One state government official put the number of Indian officials attending Davos at more than 100, with scores of company executives and a handful of startups also present. Goyal estimated overall there would be 200 Indian participants. ""We have record numbers from India,"" Sriram Gutta, head of India agenda at the WEF, said. 'NEW REALITY' Federal ministers have talked about India's economic boom and the opportunities it offers at Davos. Although Modi's government has often faced criticism from foreign companies for announcing policies which they say are protectionist in nature and favour domestic companies, India recently reported its highest ever foreign direct investment inflow, which hit $83.57 billion in 2021-22. After engaging regularly with Indian states on subjects such as agriculture technology, drones and electric vehicles, the WEF has gradually increased the number of invitations to them, Gutta said, adding that they ""will continue to gain prominence"". Even though they are run by different political parties, the states were seeking to project a united image and showcase their respective offerings for businesses, Deepak Bagla, CEO of federal investment promotion arm Invest India, told Reuters. The southern state of Andhra Pradesh signed investment pacts worth a total of $16 billion for investment in renewables at Davos, while one official said Karnataka has held meetings with prospective investors. ""What this street really shows you is the new reality of India,"" Bagla said. This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text."

The correction can be attributed to headwinds of slowing revenue growth, reduced margins, elevated consensus expectations and of course stretched stock valuations, in addition to a weak macro environment. “We do believe valuations have contracted materially, but the price paid for high earnings growth is still elevated. We strongly suggest to investors that deployment in Indian IT services segment should be very slow and gradual as we believe there will be many unknown risks ahead, which might further hamper the valuations,"" the note stated. The start of slowdown induced by central bank policy tightening is already being seen. Among mid-caps, it has retained pecking order: Coforge, MTCL and Persistent Systems. Among large-caps, the brokerage has recommended TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Wipro, Tech Mahindra. It has downgraded Mphasis' shares rating from Buy to Add. Further, given the recent sharp correction over the past month, the brokerage has upgraded its rating on Newgen to Buy. “Emphasis on costs will likely lead to dampening of tech budgets and reduce discretionary spend. Macro factors such as GDP, PMI, S&P 500 revenues and CEO confidence are worsening by the day,"" ICICI Securities added. ""We expect a ‘J line’ curve in cost items in the P&L in FY23/FY24. For example, travel costs, which accounted for 2-3% of revenues, are down to ~0.5% now. Going forward, we will also have to take into account the already high inflation, which might push travel costs (and other costs too) way higher than pre-covid levels,"" it added.

However, it was surprising for the traders as IT stocks continues to remain under pressure despite Indian National Rupee (INR) hit its record low against the US Dollar (USD). In last one week, IT majors like TCS, Infosys, Wipro ended in red zone logging weekly loss of near 3 per cent. MindTree share price shed near 2 per cent last week. However, Birlasoft shares surged around 4.50 per cent in last 5 trade sessions. Explaining why IT stocks are under pressure despite weak rupee, Ravi Singh, Vice President & Head of Research at Share India said, ""IT stocks are witnessing selling pressure as the margins have declined on account of supply side pressures and decline in implementation. As the manpower expense increased, the margins reduced due to higher attrition rates, further resulted to slower growth in profits as compared to revenue growth. Another factor contributing to IT sector fall is the US Fed tightening its monetary policy to fight inflation, putting pressure on US indices and FIIs outflow from Indian markets."" Expecting further falling IT index, Manoj Dalmia, Founder & Director at Proficient Equities said, ""Weakness in IT stocks can be attributed to three major reasons — weak margins and earnings report, higher expenses in terms of hiring and retaining employees due to demand and valuation of IT stocks is currently at about 28 times P/E compared to the past 10 year P/E of 18. We might expect the IT index to fall further till 27500 levels, investors can accumulate quality IT stocks during these falls with long term perspective."" Stocks to buy today On IT stocks that one can think of adding in portfolio at current discounted levels, Ravi Singh of Share India said, ""TCS, Infosys, Mindtree and Wipro are at value buying levels so investors may take long position in these stocks for at least 8-12 months time horizon.""

Shares fell in Japan, South Korea, Australia, and Hong Kong, while it gained marginally in Shanghai.  Indian indices on Thursday tanked massively, tracking extremely weak trends, with heavy losses recorded in market heavyweights Reliance, SBI, TCS, Infosys, among others. High crude prices and foreign fund outflows further ruined already sluggish market sentiments.

The issue will open for public subscription next week on Tuesday, May 24 and conclude on May 26. The bidding for anchor investors will open on May 23.   We maintain our BUY rating, valuing IGL at ₹520/sh on SOTP basis, (IGL-SA: ₹500/sh MNGL: ₹14.6/sh; CUGL: ₹6.5/sh). Our TP is premised upon an earnings CAGR of ~10% (FY21-30e), for IGL-SA, driven by a ~11% CAGR(FY21-30e) in gas sales and EBITDA per unit of ~6.5/unit.   IRB Infrastructure is one of the largest BOT toll operators in the country having market share of ~20% in the total Golden Quadrilateral projects, with over 3,700km of total projects successfully executed. Deal with GIC alongwith arbitration awards with respect to Pathankot Amritsar Toll project and Goa tollway project amounting to Rs7.9bn has further strengthen the balance sheet and reduce the debt level. Since most of the projects have received PCOD and new projects are yet to receive AD, we have revised our construction revenue from Rs51.8bn to Rs48.2bn in FY24. We expect IRB to report revenue/EBITDA CAGR of 13%/13% over FY22/FY24E and ROE of ~14% in FY24E. We maintain with a BUY with a revised SOTP of Rs328/shares, implying an upside potential of 54% from the current levels.

Growth momentum in the global economy is slowing down due to liquidity tightening by Central Banks. Russia – Ukraine conflict is also not showing any signs of easing with newer categories of weapons introduced in the conflict, which will keep Energy and Food prices high. Both these variables point to a stagflation kind of scenario globally, which can lead to discretionary spending going down. This is fueling greater volatility in global equity markets, including in India. We expect markets to remain volatile in the near term but expect better market conditions in the second half of the financial year once markets price in the impact of global slowdown and higher rates. So sectors which we like are good quality private sector banks, Oil Refiners and exploration companies, Agri linked companies including tractor manufacturers, Hospitality, Film Exhibitors and Hospitals.   We cut earnings estimates significantly for FY23/24 by assuming much lower growth in Gold AUM (due to structural competition and stoppage of low rate scheme), slower growth in Microfinance portfolio (challenges with quality and capital), gradual recovery in gold portfolio yield and likely continuance of elevated credit cost in microfinance. However, we retain ADD rating on the stock in the light of estimated 4%/16% RoA/RoE delivery in FY23-24 and that stock/valuation (0.8x/5x FY24 PABV/PE) seems to be largely discounting headwinds in gold and MFI businesses. Key risks to our view would be re-introduction of teaser/lower rate schemes by market/competition and capital call at Asirvad Microfinance (given abs. PAR net of ECL is nearly equal to NW). Manappuram’s dilemma of choosing between growth and profitability is structural, given its weak customer acquisition engine and borrower stickiness.   Shares of ITC Ltd. hit a fresh 52-week high of ₹279.25 apiece in opening deals on Thursday, a day when broader markets tanked. This jump in the company's shares was due to margin expansion across segments at a time when many consumer companies have been facing acute margin pressure due to higher costs.   Dividend paying stock: After Board of Directors of JK Lakshmi Cement Limited recommending 100 per cent dividend for FY2021-22, JK share price surged over 14 per cent in early morning deals on Thursday. JK Lakshmi Cement shares opened upside around ₹27 per share and went on to make intraday high of ₹448 apiece levels. The Board of Directors of JK Lakshmi Cement Limited had recommended 100 per cent dividend in financial year 2021-22 on Wednesday i.e. 18th May 2022.   In April, inflows into systematic investment plans (SIPs) of mutual funds fell around 3.8% month-on-month to ₹11,863 crore. A SIP is a mode of investment primarily into equity mutual funds. In that sense, an investor investing through the SIP route is largely buying stocks indirectly. In fact, in the seven-month period from October 2021 to April 2022, total investments made through the SIP route stood at Rs79,975 crore.   Gold prices were flat on Thursday, as an elevated U.S. dollar and rising Treasury yields weighed on greenback-priced bullion, with the metal's outlook already dampened by an aggressive Federal Reserve stance on inflation. Spot gold held its ground at $1,813.96 per ounce, as of 0512 GMT. U.S. gold futures were flat at $1,813.40. Gold's daily closing price is effectively hugging the trendline projected from the March 2020 (pandemic) low, and intraday volatile spikes either side of that key trendline have lacked conviction to prompt a sustainable move, City Index's senior market analyst Matt Simpson said.   Multibagger stock: After Covid-19 fueled sell-off in 2020, Indian stock market made its bottom on 23rd March 2020. After making its bottom, Indian market rebounded strongly in pull-back rally. In this post-Covid rally, the Dalal Street produced a good number of multibagger stocks. Tata Power shares are one of such multibagger stocks produced by the Dalal Street in post-Covid rally. In last two years after market bottom, this Tata Power share price has risen from around ₹30 to ₹237.50 levels, logging near 700 per cent return in this period. The multibagger stock has managed to give this much of return to its shareholders despite heavy sell-off in last few months after the outbreak of Russia-Ukraine war.   Oil marketing companies (OMCs) have raised prices of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) by ₹3.5, pushing up the cost of a 14.2 kg cylinder of cooking gas to ₹1,003 in the national capital. This is the second hike in LPG prices this month.   Stock market today: Shares of Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited hit upper circuit on fifth straight session today. Chennai Petroleum share price today opened downside at ₹305 apiece on NSE but soon started ascending and hit new 52-week high of ₹329.45 levels. Despite weakness and high volatility in the secondary market, the NSE listed multibagger stock has been hitting upper circuit since 13th May 2022.   A total of four stocks have been put under the ban for trade on Thursday, May 19, 2022 under the futures and options (F&O) segment by the National Stock Exchange (NSE). These securities have been put on ban under the F&O segment as they have crossed 95% of the market-wide position limit (MWPL), as per the NSE.   DLF has seen strong traction in its residential business with FY22 sales bookings of Rs72.7bn in FY22 vs. Rs30.8bn in FY21 driven by the Dec’21 launch of the One Midtown Delhi project and new launches across plots/independent floors in Gurugram and Chennai. With 7.6msf of new launches lined up in FY23E, we model for sales bookings of Rs75.6bn in FY23E and Rs79.3bn in FY24E. Further, with office re-openings and mall consumption picking up, we model for DCCDL rental EBITDA of Rs41.3bn in FY23E and Rs44.2bn in FY24E vs. Rs33.3bn achieved in FY22. We retain our BUY rating with a revised SoTP based target price of Rs446/share (earlier Rs434) as we roll forward to Mar23E NAV. Key risks are weakness in office leasing and residential demand   Bharti’s FCF generation has grown to Rs58.5bn in Q4FY22, and if we adjust for negative working capital (seasonality), it has reached quarterly run-rate of Rs70bn. This should help deleverage in coming quarters; near-term bump includes 5G spectrum auction. However, Bharti has cash infusion pending from Google and partly paid rights issue. We have marginally tweaked our EBITDA estimate and our SoTPbased target price now works out to Rs812 (earlier: Rs850). Maintain BUY.   Sustained improvement in GRMs, attractive valuations, bonus issue (1:2 declared with Q4 result) and robust dividend yield (@>10% for FY22) coupled with our assumptions of some normalcy returning to marketing margins over the next 12 months, make IOCL an attractive play at current prices. Re-initiating coverage on IOCL with BUY rating, TP of Rs165/sh, ~~40% upside from CMP.   Indian IT stocks have underperformed the benchmark Nifty by 15% in year-to-date (YTD) terms as the earnings outlook has worsened over the current earnings season.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that it’s understandable the dollar has appreciated amid rising US interest rates, and that these gains have posed a concern for some other countries.   India has expressed its concern over global food insecurity and urged to work collectively together to alleviate the sufferings of the most affected.   Shares of ITC rose in Thursday's opening deals after the FMCG major posted 12% growth in net profit to ₹4,195 crore for the January-March period, compared with ₹3,755 crore a year ago. The Kolkata-based company's revenue from operations rose 15% to ₹17,754 crore as against ₹15,404 crore in the last year period.   The rupee extended its losses and slipped 12 paise to 77.74 against the US dollar in early trade on Thursday, weighed down by a muted trend in domestic equities and unabated foreign fund outflows. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 77.72 against the American dollar, then lost ground to quote at 77.74, registering a fall of 12 paise from the last close. On Wednesday, the rupee declined by 17 paise to close at its fresh lifetime low of 77.61 against the US dollar. The rupee opened weaker against the US dollar on Thursday as global equities plunged on concerns that high inflation and monetary policy tightening will fuel an economic slowdown, said Sriram Iyer, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities.   Indian shares dropped 2% on Thursday, weighed down by a broader market selloff, as investors dumped risky assets on worries over stubborn inflation and economic slowdown. The NSE Nifty 50 index was down 1.95% at 15,924, as of 0353 GMT, with all its major sub-indexes in the negative territory, while the S&P BSE Sensex fell 2.11% to 53,067.39. Broader Asian equities tumbled after a sell-off in U.S. indexes overnight, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 dropping 3% as a rally in growth shares faded amid slowdown concerns. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan snapped its four-day winning streak to slump 2.3%.   Cooking gas LPG price hiked by ₹3.50 per cylinder, now costs ₹1,003 in Delhi: Oil company price notification (PTI)   6 stocks to buy or sell today — 19th May   One of the members of the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy committee pressed for an immediate repo rate hike of more than 100 basis points, while others favoured less aggressive rate action in future, minutes of the rate-setting panel’s last meeting showed. While all of them voted for an off-cycle policy rate hike in May, some felt that it was necessary to avoid stronger rate action going forward.   Britain's inflation rate has surged to a 40-year high on soaring energy costs, official data showed Wednesday, sparking calls for an emergency government budget to combat a worsening cost-of-living crisis. Annual inflation soared to 9.0 percent in April from 7.0 percent in March, the Office for National Statistics said, delivering another heavy blow to Britons whose wages were already failing to keep pace with surging prices. April's headline figure marked the highest inflation rate since 1982, the ONS added.   JSW Infrastructure Ltd., a unit of tycoon Sajjan Jindal’s steel-to-cement conglomerate, is planning an initial public offering by March 2024. The Mumbai-based company, which operates seaports and terminals, will soon start the process of engaging investment bankers and professional agencies to facilitate the listing, Joint Managing Director Arun Maheshwari said in an interview. The firm will take a “balanced view"" on geopolitical risks and inflationary pressures among other factors while deciding on the timing for the listing, he said.   London copper prices were flat on Thursday, as mounting worries over a global economic slowdown amid aggressive policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve and ongoing lockdowns in China dented investors' risk appetite. * Benchmark three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was steady at $9,236.50 a tonne, as of 0213 GMT, after dropping 1.4% in the previous session. * The most-active June copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was down 0.5% at 71,380 yuan ($10,556.36) a tonne. * China has policy room to cope with challenges, as the downward pressure on China's economy increases, state media quoted Premier Li Keqiang as saying on Wednesday.   Safe-haven currencies, including the dollar, eased on Thursday, pausing for breath after big gains the previous session as Wall Street stocks tumbled amid mounting concerns that aggressive tightening by the Federal Reserve and other global central banks could choke growth. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major peers, edged 0.05% lower to 103.74, after a 0.55% jump overnight that ended a three-day losing streak. The yen slipped, with the dollar adding 0.21% to 128.495 yen after a 0.86% tumble on Wednesday. The Swiss franc continued to strengthen, with the dollar losing a further 0.13% to 0.9869 franc, following a 0.6% slide. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was steady around 2.89% in Tokyo trading after dropping from as high as 3.015% in the prior session.   The pandemic vastly changed the way Americans spend money and now as they return to pre-pandemic behavior, they’re tripping up retailers again. That dynamic has only been intensified in recent months as inflation jumps sharply, and the latest financial report from Target underscores the challenges. Target reported Wednesday that its profit tumbled 52% compared with the same period last year in an environment of rising costs for things like fuel, and also a lightening quick return by consumers to more normalized spending. Purchases of big TVs and appliances that Americans loaded up on during the pandemic have faded, leaving Target with a bloated inventory that must be marked down to sell. Target's quarterly financial report comes a day after shares of rival Walmart tumbled about 17% for similar reasons after it posted quarterly results. Both companies missed profit expectations by a wide margin. Shares of Walmart fell another 8% Wednesday.   Gold prices were flat on Thursday, as an elevated dollar weighed on greenback-priced bullion and countered support from lower Treasury yields, with the metal's outlook already dulled by an aggressive Federal Reserve stance on inflation. * Spot gold held its ground at $1,816.63 per ounce at 0047 GMT. U.S. gold futures edged 0.1% lower to $1,814.10. * The U.S. dollar rose on Wednesday, snapping a three-session losing streak, as concerns about the outlook for global economic growth and rapid inflation knocked sentiment a day after Fed Chair Jerome Powell struck a more hawkish tone.   Three weeks after Wells Fargo Investment Institute cut its view on the S&P 500, it did this again, saying a mild recession is now its base-case view. The investment advisory firm slashed its year-end target by 300 points Wednesday, on top of the 200-point cut it made late April. The advisory arm of Wells Fargo & Co. now sees the gauge trading in the 4,200-4,400 range by Christmas. That represents a drop of as much as 7.7% for the full year, but a gain of up to 12% from current levels. “We have noted a growing recession risk since early this year,"" Wells Fargo Investment Institute’s strategists wrote in a note to clients. “As we weigh the latest monthly and weekly data, the economy has crossed a probability level that makes a mild and short-lived recession our base case.""   Hong Kong stocks were down by more than three percent Thursday, after Wall Street suffered one of its worst batterings in two years. The Hang Seng index was down 3.03 percent, or 625.84 points, at 20,018.44.   Yesterday’s massive rally was followed by yet another gap up opening with modest gains. We clearly shrugged off the global cues as the SGX Nifty was indicating a sluggish start in the morning. In the initial trades, Nifty extended its gains towards 16400, but failed to sustain at higher levels. Around the midsession, Key indices pared down all gains and slipped marginally in the red. Fortunately, a smart recovery immediately after the midseason pulled Nifty back to 16350, which again got sold into to conclude the choppy session on a flat note. Since the overall global picture has not changed yet, our market was unable to keep up the same momentum as we witnessed during yesterday’s short covering move. Traders chose to take some money off the table after reaching the key resistance zone of 16400 – 16500. Now although we have seen some sluggish moves today, we expect buying to emerge at lower levels till the time Nifty holds its sacrosanct support zone of 16100 – 16000. Traders can certainly take a punt as close as possible to 16150 – 16100 on the expiry session. On the flipside, it’s advisable to lighten up longs around the higher range of 16400 – 16500. The real strength will come back in our market only after surpassing the sturdy wall of 16500 – 16600, till then it would be a prudent strategy to adopt ‘One step at a time’ strategy. Today, there wasn’t much sectoral participation seen in the market; but the FMCG space stood out and some of the heavyweights like, HINDUNILVR are poised for some decent moves. Also, one can focus on banking and metal counters which are likely to perform well if there is no aberration globally.   Oil prices fell 2.5% on Wednesday, reversing early gains as traders grew less worried about a supply crunch after government data showed U.S. refiners ramped up output, and as crude futures followed Wall Street lower. Brent crude futures for July settled down $2.82, or 2.5%, at $109.11 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for June fell $2.81, or 2.5%, to $109.59 a barrel. Both benchmarks gave up early gains of $2-$3 a barrel following a change in risk sentiment as equity markets fell, said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.   Asian stocks tracked a steep Wall Street selloff on Thursday, as investors fretted over rising global inflation, China's zero-COVID policy and the Ukraine war, while the safe-haven dollar held most of its strong overnight gains. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 2% in early Asian trading hours, the first daily decline in a week. Japan's Nikkei tumbled 2.4%. Pulling it lower was a 1.5% loss for Australia's resource-heavy index, a 2.6% drop in Hong Kong stocks and a 1% retreat for blue chips in mainland China . Overnight on Wall Street, earnings reports from retail giants soured sentiment, with Target Corp warning of a bigger margin hit due to rising fuel and freight costs as it reported its quarterly profit had halved. One day earlier, Walmart Inc warned of similar margin squeezes. Target's shares plunged 24.88%, the biggest one-day percentage drop since the ""Black Monday"" stock market crash on Oct. 19, 1987. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq fall almost 5% while the S&P 500 lost 4%.   A slump in stocks extended into Asia Thursday and US equity futures retreated after mounting fears of an economic downturn hit Wall Street shares and spurred a flight to havens including sovereign bonds. Equities slid in Japan, Australia and South Korea in the wake of a 4% plunge in the S&P 500 index, the biggest daily drop in almost two years, and a more than 5% tumble in the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 index. Earnings reports from consumer stalwarts stoked worries that high inflation is weighing on margins and consumer spending. Target Corp. plunged the most since Black Monday in 1987, a day after Walmart Inc. also spiraled lower. Federal Reserve officials reaffirmed that sharply tighter monetary policy lies ahead to cool economic activity and get price pressures under control. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said raising interest rates somewhat above the neutral level and stopping there should help bring inflation down. Treasuries climbed amid fraying risk appetite. The dollar pared an advance. Bonds in Australia and New Zealand jumped in the slipstream of the US session. China’s Covid lockdowns amid a persistent omicron outbreak are also buffeting markets. Oil sank below $109 a barrel on concerns about demand. The challenge from inflation for bellwether retailers weakens the argument that corporate earnings can help stem this year’s rout in stocks. Instead, global equities are sliding toward a bear market as recession fears mount.  "

A Mint report on 17 May about Infosys Ltd planning bumper raises and retention bonuses underscores the challenges faced by the industry that is the country’s largest employment generator in the organized sector. Salaries have been rising for techies in the last two years primarily on account of the changing nature of work for technology services companies, and also because of the ill-timed moves by some if not all of them. India’s information technology services sector has about three dozen listed companies and thousands of privately-held firms that Nasscom estimates together did $227 billion in business in the year ended March 2022. The five of the largest homegrown technology services firms -- Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd -- together accounted for about 40% of the country’s $178 billion in IT exports last year. Four years back, in the year ended March 2018, these companies, put together, hired 5,182 employees.           "
Updated: 13 May 2022,"IT/ITes to hire up to 1 mn by end-2023, says industry body",https://www.livemint.com/industry/human-resource/itites-to-hire-up-to-1-mn-by-end-2023-says-industry-body-11652383759868.html,"The domestic IT and ITes industry is set to hire 800,000 to one million people by the end of 2023, according to estimates by the Indian Staffing Federation (ISF), which represents more than 100 recruitment and flexi staffing companies.  The hiring frenzy in the tech sector will continue and it will take at least a year for the attrition to subside as the pressure to poach from rivals abates. “The sector is adding 400,000-500,000 a year and we do not see demand easing soon,"" said ISF president Lohit Bhatia. The tech sector currently employs about 4.5 million people. The industry body, which sees a large portion of the workforce with 0-8 years experience, does not expect any of the tech firms to change their non-compete clauses. “I don’t think any organization would completely open the no-compete clause and allow people to walk away with data and customer information,"" Bhatia said. ISF’s comments come on the back of a Pune-based labour union’s appeal to the Union labour ministry seeking removal of the non-compete clause by IT giant Infosys. The clause, a common practice in the industry, prevents employees from joining a rival firm on similar projects, clients, and geographies. The focus on these clauses come at a time when the tech sector is battling record high attrition. Infosys, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Technologies faced record high attrition levels in the March quarter. Infosys posted an attrition rate of 27.7%, while TCS had an attrition rate of 17.4% during the quarter. Wipro clocked an attrition rate of 23.8%, while that of HCL was 21.9%.  However, ISF’s Bhatia said that the attrition numbers will come down in a year. “Attrition is hovering around 25%. It will ease in a year once tech firms with their hybrid policies hire from smaller towns. This will ease pressure to recruit from rivals in cities,"" he said. The industry body is optimistic that hiring demand will be seen beyond technology as hospitality, aviation and retail sectors return to pre-pandemic levels. Most of the job roles are “covid proof"" where only a few may run the risk of a salary dip, according to a study by recruitment firm TeamLease Services. The Jobs and Salaries Primer FY 2021-22 was done from salary data of 410,000 employees and it showed that salaries grew by a minimum of 4.11 % and a maximum of 10.71% across sectors in FY22."

However, the 50 stocks index extended its intraday losses further and hit today's low of 15,800. Global equity markets including Dalal Street have been reeling under sell-off heat after the outbreak of Russia-Ukraine war and in last two and half months, key benchmark indices have been continuously nosediving. In fact, NSE Nifty has nosedived around 15 per cent from its 52-week high of 18,604. In fact some quality Nifty-listed stocks have also corrected strongly in recent few months. Stocks like Wipro, HDFC Ltd and Bajaj Auto have outperformed the 50-stock index. Here we list out complete details in regard to these 3 Nifty-listed stocks that tumbled more than the Nifty 50 index: 1] Wipro share price: This IT major's 52-week high is ₹739.85 apiece on NSE whereas W‬ipro share price today is ₹471.50. So, Wipro shares have corrected to the tune of 35 per cent from its 52-week high and recent sell-off in the stock, especially after the announcement of quarterly results of the company, has a major role in it. 2] HDFC Ltd: Housing Development Finance Corp Ltd or HDFC Ltd share price today is around ₹2170 whereas its 52-week high is ₹3021 per share on NSE. So, the stock has corrected around 28 per cent from its 52-week high. In last one month, this stock has corrected more than 10 per cent whereas in YTD time, it has tumbled to the tune of near 18 per cent. The stock has been in consolidation phase since mid-November 2021 and every rise in the counter has been seen as selling opportunity in the counter. 3] Bajaj Auto: This Nifty-listed auto major is currently quoting at ₹3572 per share on NSE whereas its 52-week high is ₹4,347. So, Bajaj Auto share price has corrected around 18 per cent from its 52-week high. It would be interesting to know that Bajaj Auto shares have made good upside attempt in early March to April end period in 2022. But, the stock has been under sell-off heat after ushering in May 2022. Bajaj Auto stocks had made its 52-week high in June 2021."
Updated: 11 May 2022,IT companies acquire smaller firms as they shift to deliver digital-led projects,https://www.livemint.com/industry/infotech/it-companies-acquire-smaller-firms-as-they-shift-to-deliver-digital-led-projects-11652212191581.html,"Indian IT services companies are increasingly acquiring specialized firms to scale up digital capabilities, as the process of building in-house capacity for digital projects can be very long, and delivery can be even more complex, said experts. Acquisitions allow them to get instant access to capabilities, enter newer markets, and have ready talent, they added. Indian IT companies have been organized and have built their capacities to deliver large projects at low costs. However, digital projects are a different ball game as these have characteristics that are opposite of large projects. Such projects are smaller and complex and require high-paid experts to deliver. While margins as a percentage of revenue may be higher, digital projects are typically much smaller, yielding much lower absolute margins, said experts. According to Abhisek Mukherjee, co-founder and director of management consultancy firm Auctus Advisors, given this inherent dichotomy, attempts to build some pockets of digital capabilities in-house leads to two challenges. “One, given the smaller size of the projects, revenue leaders do not focus on these adequately. Two, and more importantly, expensive talent leads to culture clashes with the larger organization."" “The smart workaround is to acquire digital-native firms and run them relatively independently. The firms can then deliver the smaller, but highly profitable and influential, digital projects and the organization can step in downstream. After multiple false starts to build the capabilities in-house, larger players seem to have homed in on this acquisition-led strategy,"" he added. For instance, in 2022, Infosys Ltd acquired two companies—German digital marketing agency oddity and Australia’s Carter Digital—to grow its design and experience capabilities. The companies will be part of Wongdoody, which was acquired by Infosys in 2018, and will join its network of studios across Seattle, Providence, Los Angeles, Houston, New York and London, and the design hubs across five cities in India. Infosys Consulting’s acquisition of Singapore telecom major Singtel’s delivery centre in Malaysia in 2021 helped the company expand its footprint in Southeast Asia to service international clients. In April, Wipro Ltd said it will acquire Rizing Intermediate Holdings Inc., a global SAP consulting firm, for $540 million, to bolster its SAP cloud practice and help clients transform businesses into intelligent enterprises. As one of the leading strategic partners in the world for SAP, Rizing is expected to be a critical extension of Wipro’s SAP cloud practice and Wipro FullStride cloud services. The company expects the combined offering to help expand its leadership across oil and gas, utilities, manufacturing and consumer industries. Rizing is the latest in a series of acquisitions, underscoring Wipro’s ambitious growth agenda under chief executive Thierry Delaporte. The recent acquisition of LeanSwift Solutions, a US-based system integrator of Infor Products, is also aimed at complementing its cloud capabilities, especially in the manufacturing and distribution sectors. Wipro has also acquired Convergence Acceleration Solutions (CAS Group) for $80 million to expand its consulting capabilities for communications service providers. In a bid to strengthen its play in the cybersecurity space, it also acquired Texas-based Edgile for $230 million in December."
Updated: 10 May 2022,Intel introduces new global rewards policy for employees,https://www.livemint.com/industry/human-resource/intel-introduces-new-global-rewards-policy-for-employees-11652122742478.html,"Intel Corp. introduced a rewards and recognition (R&R) programme for its 120,000 employees worldwide as the US chip giant seeks to attract new talent and retain existing employees amid a covid-induced spurt in demand for tech workers. “You’ve got to reward people for the work that they do. You also get to reward people in terms of an outcome and people like a tangible kind of a thing,"" Vijay Colaco, human resource director at Intel India said in an interview. He did not disclose the size of Intel’s workforce in India. The quarterly R&R programme will be over and above the annual appraisal cycle of an Intel employee and could result in either monetary or non-monetary benefits. “It could be either through money or higher education. You could also use various others ways to actually recognize and reward your employees,"" Colaco said. The new policy, which was rolled out six months ago, comes as technology firms devise new strategies to retain employees as they battle high attrition following increased digitalization and growing demand for tech workers. India is home to Intel’s second-largest research and development centre outside of the US. Attrition levels at Infosys, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Technologies hit record highs in the March quarter. Infosys posted an attrition rate of 27.7% while TCS had an attrition rate of 17.4% during the quarter. Wipro clocked an attrition rate of 23.8% while that of HCL was 21.9%. “Employee engagements have to become more often than an annual discussion during appraisal. More IT and ITes companies are coming up with quarterly R&R programmes. Annual cycles will in future only be used for corrections and inflation adjusted hikes,"" said Guruprasad Srinivasan, group chief executive at recruitment firm Quess Corp. He pointed out that the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) and retail sectors had monthly and quarterly incentives, and R&R programmes for sales teams. This concept is now being increasingly adopted across profiles and sectors. According to recruiters, after a two-year work from home policy with companies asking employees to return to offices, budgetary allocations towards R&R have to increase as employees will need more incentives. Product firms and other tech companies are also facing the brunt of the ongoing hiring frenzy. However, Intel’s attrition is “below the average semiconductor, IT sector"", Colaco said without elaborating. He said the latest form of R&R is not a top down approach. “I think that’s certainly not working. Earlier, the manager tells you to do these 10 things and people say ...I’ve delivered; now, what next and I don’t want to do this anymore. I’ll go do something else,"" Colaco said. The latest co-created approach is very unique to Intel, he said adding that the company runs a quarterly engagement activity between a manager and an employee where they engage in discussions. The employee needs to know how his work is impacting the broader organization and whether he is “touching the big picture"", he said. “We have got managers to start focusing working on the individuals to start understand the purpose, the vision, and the impact of their work...when you bring in a co-created methodology between a manager and employee, the sense of purpose and the sense of gratification also starts coming in and you see that quickly on quarter-on-quarter basis,"" Colaco said."

Updated: 02 May 2022,Indian IT cos eye eastern Europe for growth,https://www.livemint.com/industry/infotech/indian-it-cos-eye-eastern-europe-for-growth-11651512150136.html,"BENGALURU : While most Indian IT companies have moved out of Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, they are expanding in other Eastern European countries despite the uncertainties and a possible slowdown in business momentum. Eastern European nations, such as Poland, Romania and Hungary, are attractive hubs for Indian IT companies to set up nearshore delivery centres due to the availability of quality talent in similar time zones. For instance, Poland is home to around 300,000 IT professionals with a good command over foreign languages. According to management consulting firm A.T. Kearney, Poland is a prominent outsourcing destination and has a favourable business environment. “Today we have no centre in Ukraine but the other areas we have been expanding in and that has developed quite well… for our centres in other geographies in Eastern Europe we are seeing good growth…at our centres in Poland and Romania we are actively recruiting and scaling up,"" Salil Parekh, chief executive and managing director, Infosys, said during the Q4 analysts’ call. At the earnings call, Wipro chief executive Thierry Delaporte also said while it does not have any operation either in Russia or Ukraine, it continues to hire and expand in Romania and Poland as part of its normal business operations. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) said clients continue to spend on technology as long as they have the confidence that service providers are able to deliver. “Customers are asking us whether we could actually execute it (projects) from our Eastern European development centres,"" Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive and managing director, TCS, said during the analyst call. Analysts, however, warned that although the war may not have a direct impact on Indian IT firms it will result in shrinking IT budgets and slowdown in decision-making. “Rising inflation compounded with talent shortage has led to chief information officers rethinking their IT budgets that have slowed the decision-making process, especially in Europe where IT spending has paused. Higher inflation will lead to postponement of discretionary spends, and focus on cost optimisation will increase,"" ICICI Securities analysts said."

Updated: 02 May 2022,Is Wipro's turnaround story losing steam?,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/is-wipro-s-turnaround-story-losing-steam-11651466681766.html,"Large-cap IT company Wipro Ltd's March quarter earnings were disappointing. Shares of the company fell 2.5% on the NSE in Monday's early trade, reacting to its earnings. In Q4FY22, its IT services revenue grew 3.1% in constant currency (CC) terms sequentially, missing the consensus estimate of 3.4%. Ebit margin declined 60 basis points sequentially to 17%. Ebit is short for earnings before interest and tax. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd note that Ebit margin is the lowest since 1QFY19 levels were impacted adversely by the dilutive impact of acquisitions made by Wipro through the past 18 months. For Q1FY23, Wipro has guided for 1-3% sequential CC growth in IT services revenue. This guidance does not include contributions from its recent Rizing acquisition. The company's management is confident of sustaining revenue growth momentum and achieving double-digit growth in FY23. However, analysts do not share this optimism. In fact, they note that Q1FY23 revenue growth guidance is not only lower than 2-4% sequential revenue growth guidance for past two quarters but is also below consensus expectations. Further, some of them are also worried that Wipro's turnaround story may be losing its steam. Note that bluechip IT stocks have corrected in recent months with the Nifty IT index declining 21% so far in this calendar year; Wipro shares have fallen 31%. ""Under-performance stems from increasing doubts around the turnaround story after two quarters of average QoQ growth in both 3Q and 4Q in FY22,"" said analysts at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities. Besides, the ‘profitable growth’ promise has been dented with margins being reset downwards a few times, said the domestic brokerage house in a report dated 30 April. Wipro's margins, in the near-term, are expected to be lower due to supply-side challenges and planned investments. However, in the medium term, the management sees it sustaining at 17-17.5%. Sharing a similar worry, analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd have lowered the stock's FY23/24 earnings per share estimate by 1.3%/1.6%, respectively. The brokerage house said that it would await further evidence of the execution of Wipro’s refreshed strategy, and a successful turnaround from its growth struggles, before turning more constructive on the stock. Investors would reckon that shares of Wipro saw a sharp up move and re-rating after Thierry Delaporte became its CEO amidst the pandemic. Under Delaporte, Wipro has been boosting its growth mainly via acquisitions."

Those at Motilal Oswal maintained Neutral rating on Wipro shares, with a target price of ₹540, as they await further evidence of the execution of Wipro's refreshed strategy, and a successful turnaround from its growth struggles over the last decade, before turning more constructive on the stock. “Its margins are likely to be below the medium-term guided range of 17-17.5%. Moreover, its capital allocation has started suffering due to elevated investments in Consulting capabilities and should impact FY23E payout as well,"" the note stated. As per Prabhudas Lilladher, Wipro’s new strategy and investments are progressing well – 60 synergy deals with Capco, 16% more senior leaders closer to clients and 30% YoY growth in cloud ecosystem in FY22. However, material large/mega deal wins or increase in organic revenue guidance from 2QFY23 will be key triggers for the stock going forward.

This translates to a sequential growth of 1-3%, lower than the 2-4% it had guided for the March quarter. Unlike Infosys, which gives a forecast for the full fiscal year, Wipro gives its estimates for the quarter ahead. The Bengaluru-based company’s net profit for the March quarter rose nearly 4% to ₹3,087 crore from ₹2,972 crore in the year-ago period, in line with Bloomberg estimates of ₹3,005 crore. The revenue for the March quarter grew 29.4% annually to ₹20,860 crore on the back of a strong demand environment for digital solutions. Revenues were in line with consensus Bloomberg estimates of ₹20,819 crore. Revenue in dollar terms grew 3.1% sequentially to $2.72 billion on the back of some large deal wins and expansion in smaller deals. The revenue for FY22 grew 26.9% in constant currency to $10.4 billion, crossing the $10 billion mark. “This is our sixth straight quarter of strong revenue growth at or over 3%. We are excited about the addition of Rizing and the CAS Group to Wipro’s service offerings. With all markets, sectors, and global business lines now growing in double-digits year-on-year, we have a strong foundation for next year’s growth,"" said Thierry Delaporte, chief executive and managing director of Wipro. The operating margin narrowed to 17% in the March quarter from 21% a year ago and 17.6% in the preceding three months, owing to high costs related to attrition and hiring. The voluntary attrition rate on a last 12-month basis for the March quarter rose to 23.8% from 12.1% a year ago and 22.7% in the December quarter. The company is, however, confident of retaining top talent through various employee-centric initiatives such as giving freshers a five-year growth plan, said Saurabh Govil, chief human resources officer, Wipro. Wipro made a net addition of 45,416 people during FY22, taking the total headcount to 243,128 employees as of 31 March 2022. Further, the company will onboard about 40,000 freshers in FY23, double what it had hired in the previous fiscal year. Effective last January, Wipro reorganized its IT services segment into four strategic market units, all of which projected strong growth during the March quarter. On an annual basis, while Americas 1 and Americas 2 grew 22.2% and 33.8%, respectively, Europe grew 36% in constant currency, and Asia Pacific Middle East Africa (APMEA) region grew 14%. The two global business lines—iDEAS (Integrated Digital, Engineering & Application Services) and iCORE (Cloud Infrastructure, Digital Operations, Risk & Enterprise Cyber Security Services)—grew 38.5% and 15.2% year-on-year in constant currency, respectively, during the March quarter. Analysts believe the earnings align with Wipro’s vision of becoming a transformational player. “The organization has been working on digital transformation for its clients for quite some time and is one of the early adopters of digital capabilities. Its healthy pipeline is promising but is dependent on its resources and employee churn for proper execution. Wipro’s business outcome-based Fullstride Cloud Services looks promising for customers, and Wipro continues to evolve its platforms,"" said D.D. Mishra, senior director analyst, Gartner. Wipro reported its earnings after market hours on Friday. Ahead of its earnings, Wipro shares fell 2.59% to ₹509 on BSE."

The earnings of its larger peers Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd, and HCL Technologies Ltd were below Street expectations and reflected supply-side pressures that dragged margins. All eyes are on Wipro now to see whether it will follow its peers or buck the trend. As per Bloomberg consensus estimates, Wipro is expected to post a net profit ₹3,005 crore on revenue of ₹20,819 crore. Mint highlights five things to watch out for in Wipro’s fourth quarter (Q4) earnings that will be declared on 29 April, after market hours. Revenue guidance and growth Analysts expect Wipro to post a constant currency revenue growth of 3.6% sequentially, in line with its Q4 revenue growth guidance of 2-4%. In dollar terms, revenue is expected to grow 3.3% sequentially. “Growth would be led by higher spending on digital and cloud transformation initiatives, higher growth in existing accounts and incremental revenue contribution from Edgile and LeanSwift acquisitions,"" Sharekhan said in a pre-earnings note. Operating margins Margins are under pressure due to increased attrition and employee costs. “EBIT margins in global IT services are expected to decline by 30 basis points QoQ, due to impact of salary hike amid higher attrition. Overall EBIT margins are expected to decline 20 bps QoQ due to weak performance in IT services,"" ICICI Securities said. Brokerage firm Sharekhan believes EBIT margin in IT services is expected to decline by 10 basis points QoQ, owing to higher hiring expenses to backfill rising attrition and rising discretionary expenses. Deal pipeline Investors will closely watch the deal pipeline of Wipro and how it has managed to ramp up some of the large deals it has won in the past. It acquired UK-based consultancy Capco for $1.45 billion last year, so, investors will monitor management’s commentary on the impact of Capco business due to current geo-political tensions. Commentary on the size and tenure of deals will be taken note of.

Revenue growth in constant currency terms rose 1.1% sequentially largely in-line with expectations. While its IT services business aided revenue growth, the products & platforms business was a drag. The company signed six large services and four product deals across verticals for a total new deal total contract value of $2.3 billion. For FY23, the company has guided for dollar revenue growth of 12-14% in constant currency terms. This is likely to be aided by continued traction in its services business and a healthy deal pipeline. Ebit margin for FY23 is seen in the 18-20% range. Ebit is short for earnings before interest and tax. While HCL’s FY23 margin guidance is pretty much on expected lines, its revenue guidance is ahead of estimates, said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. That said, the domestic brokerage house cautions that even though HCL’s IT services margins will keep on improving, volatility in the products segment will continue. Analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd expect HCL to struggle on margins. They say elevated supply-side issues and a higher investment requirement will result in HCL’s Ebit margin staying at the lower end of its guidance, before recovering in FY24. It should be noted that on a last twelve-month trailing basis, HCL’s IT services attrition rose to 21.9% in Q4FY22 from 19.8% in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, in the last one year, the HCL Technologies stock has risen by 15%. Peers Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd have risen by 16% and 18%, respectively. On the valuations front, analysts at IIFL Securities Ltd note that while the stock is trading at 30% discount to peers, rerating would be contingent on a more consistent delivery on growth and margins."

Updated: 15 Apr 2022,Talent churn in IT sector may stabilize in 6 months: Experts,https://www.livemint.com/industry/infotech/talent-churn-in-it-sector-may-stabilize-in-6-months-experts-11649953679909.html,"Some of India’s biggest information technology (IT) companies are facing an unprecedented surge in employee attrition as a pandemic-induced acceleration in digital transformation leads to an intense race for talent from global rivals as well as smaller and nimbler rivals such as startups. Companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd, and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. have seen record churn among their ranks. Industry experts have, however, predicted that the situation will ease shortly, possibly over the next six months. “Talent that transitioned out from Infosys and TCS last financial year, was absorbed by a nearly identical set of enterprises. In either of the cases, the Top 12 absorbers have taken over one-third of talent on the move,"" said Kamal Karanth, co-founder, Xpheno, a specialist staffing company. According to data from Xpheno shared exclusively withMint, most of whom who left Infosys in FY22 joined Accenture, followed by Cognizant, TCS, and Deloitte. At the same time, top recruiters who picked up TCS employees were Accenture, Cognizant, Infosys, and Deloitte. On a trailing twelve months (TTM) basis, Infosys’ attrition rate climbed to 27.7% in Q4 from 15.2% a year earlier, and 25.5% in the December quarter. On a TTM basis, attrition rate at TCS, the lowest in the industry, rose to 17.4% in Q4 from 7.2% a year earlier, and 15.3% in the December quarter.  The ongoing competition for talent may not last beyond two quarters, said experts. “We see this trend continuing for another six months because all companies will have to be profitable as much as they can and this environment will reset. Ultimately, the skills are not valuable if you keep outpaying someone beyond its value,"" said Thirukkumaran Nagarajan, vice president and head of human resources, IBM India and South Asia. IBM’s attrition rate, at less than 20%, is, however, more than its past but less than the market levels. HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro are set to declare their fiscal fourth-quarter results on 21 April and 29 April, respectively. The industry has been battling high attrition rates as demand for digital talent continues to outpace supply. The ‘Great Resignation’ was the term coined a few months ago when employees, mainly in the tech and startup sector, were flooded with offers, joining bonuses, and counter offers. As Indian companies try to keep pace with digital adoption and cloud-based services, their need for experts in Java, Javascript, Python, SQL, remains unsatiated. Infosys hired 85,000 freshers last fiscal, and plans to hire about 50,000 college graduates in FY23. Rival TCS onboarded close to 78,000 freshers in FY22 and aims to hire about 40,000 people from campuses this year. With the attrition scenario still to improve, other tech majors are expected to hire an equal number of freshers as last year. The management of the top IT firms believe that hiring and training freshers is the only sustainable way to fill demand. “This excess demand outpacing supply will continue for the next 2-3 quarters. The IT sector has always seen high attrition but after a few months, attrition numbers will come down to 15%,"" said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder of staffing firm TeamLease Services. While brokerage firm Motilal Oswal forecast attrition to remain at “elevated levels"" and “supply will continue to lag ever increasing demand"", it added that there may be some moderation in attrition starting this fiscal. These large-scale hiring is also impacting the companies’ margins as employee expenses shoot up. “The attrition across companies would continue to be high and, hence, cost to backfill attrition (at higher costs) and costs related to retention, bonus, rationalisation of compensations is expected to put pressure on margins,"" said ICICI Direct Research in a report."

Updated: 07 Apr 2022,Demand outlook for IT companies seen strong even as margins witness pressure,https://www.livemint.com/industry/infotech/demand-outlook-for-it-companies-seen-strong-even-as-margins-witness-pressure-11649312334742.html,"BENGALURU: With Indian IT services companies are set to announce their fiscal fourth quarter earnings (Q4FY22) beginning next week, investors will keep an eye on both the numbers and trends. As per sector analysts, demand outlook for Indian IT services companies remains robust on the back of strong tailwinds for the industry following digital and cloud transformation initiatives with enterprise clients. India’s largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) will announce its Q4FY22 earnings on 11 April, while Bengaluru-based Infosys Ltd. will release its numbers on 12 April. “The companies continue to see a demand tailwind in terms of investment in newer technologies like cloud transformation, AI/ML, blockchain, which is expected to further propel demand in coming quarters,"" ICICI Securities said in an earnings preview report. Accenture, which follows a September-August accounting calendar, reported strong second quarter earnings last month beating its own estimates. Accenture’s commentary suggests that only 30% of applications have so far migrated to cloud, indicating a huge scope for cloud transformation deals ahead. Analysts expect the revenue commentary of Indian IT companies to remain strong in Q4, with no impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and inflation on demand. “While tier-II players would continue to outgrow tier-I companies, the gap should start shrinking in Q4. Revenue growth is expected to moderate QoQ in Q4 as a high base effect comes into play,"" brokerage firm Motilal Oswal said. Brokerage firms expect TCS, Infosys, and Wipro to report constant currency revenue growth of 3.0-3.5% sequentially, while HCL Technologies is expected to post the weakest growth of 2.0% on a quarterly basis due to negative impact of its products and platforms business. However, margins of IT companies are expected to come under pressure, and either remain flat or decline in Q4 due to supply side headwinds. According to brokerage firm Sharekhan, EBIT margin is expected to remain flat to negative sequentially in Q4, “owing to slower revenue growth, lateral hires, and increasing travel expenses."" Motilal Oswal shared similar views, “We may see muted margins on account of wage inflation and slower growth in Q4 FY22."" During the fourth quarter earnings, some of the key factors investors will watch out for are improvement in deal pipeline, demand outlook for FY23, hiring/attrition trends, and margin outlook, according to ICICI Securities. “Further, the proposed restructuring by TCS and whether other IT companies would also follow on the same or not, would be an area of interest for the investors."""
