The Indian rupee fell 19 paise to close at all-time low of 79.04 (provisional) against US dollar. The surge in the dollar has set Asian currencies on course for their worst quarter since 1997 and created a dilemma for central bankers. Shares slipped on Wednesday in Europe and Asia ahead of the latest update on US economic growth, while oil prices were lower. A weaker-than-expected US consumer confidence reading highlighted worsening consumer expectations due to persistently high inflation. Shares fell in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and South Korea.  Indian indices snapped their four-day gain on Wednesday amid weak global market trends and inflation concerns.

The Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) selected Gupta, 56, for the post of chairman and managing director of GAIL after interviewing 10 candidates, it said in a post-interview notice. He will replace Manoj Jain, who is scheduled to retire on August 31.   Last year, government has issued a notification regarding Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021, in which single use plastic will be banned from 1st July 2022. Given, the rising concern over climatic change and environmental pollution, the extension of this deadline is very unlikely. The ban is on rigid plastic items such as plates, cups, glasses, cutlery, wrapping or packaging films, PVC banners less than 100 micron, straws and stirrers. The industry size of single-use plastics is estimated to be ₹10,000 crore. This has been positive news for paper industry as the opportunity to replace the single use plastic with paper has been huge. However, currently, India lag on require infrastructure to entirely replace the single use plastic. For example, India consume about 6 billion of plastic straws every year which need to replace with paper straw and currently, India does not have domestic manufacturing capacity for this.

We tweak our FY23/24E earnings lower by ~1%. IGL reported strong results with EBIDTA/PAT of Rs5.0bn (6%Q/Q; PLe Rs3.9bn) and Rs3.6bn (16%Q/Q; PLe Rs2.7bn), due to higher margins given lower spot purchase. Volumes were lower QoQ partly due to pandemic restrictions in January and were at 7.7mscmd (-1%Q/Q). For FY22, EBIDTA/PAT was at Rs18.8bn (+11% 2yr CAGR) and Rs13.1bn (2yr CAGR 7.7%). We believe pick-up in economic activity will drive growth in coming quarters. IGL remains an enviable business model with high volume growth due to geographical expansion and addition of new buses and taxis. Also, fuel economics, shift to private vehicle ownership post pandemic will drive CNG volumes despite excise duty cuts, in our view. Reiterate “BUY"" with DCF-based PT of Rs589 (Rs662) as we raise the WACC to 10.3% from 9.7%.   “NYMEX crude trades marginally lower near $111/bbl after recovering nearly 10% from recent lows. Crude oil rose in last few days on supply concerns as G7 members worked on ways to cap Russian crude prices, Libya and Ecuador faced supply disruptions due to political issues and as some major producers like UAE indicated that they were producing near capacity. The momentum is crude oil however came to a halt as disappointing US economic data rekindled demand concerns and as market players positioned for weekly inventory report. Crude may remain choppy ahead of inventory report however lack of any positive surprise may result in some profit taking.""   “COMEX gold trades in a range near $1820/oz as support from disappointing US economic data, ban on Russian gold imports by some G7 countries, sharp rebound in crude oil price and improving outlook for Chinese economy is countered by rebound in US dollar index, attempts at recovery by equity markets, continuing ETF outflows and monetary tightening stance of major central banks. Gold remains stuck in the $1800-1850/oz and this may continue amid lack of fresh triggers however with Fed’s emphasis on aggressive tightening, the US dollar may remain supported keeping pressure on gold prices..""   We downgrade MM to HOLD with revised DCF-based target price of Rs1,150 (earlier: Rs1,065), implying 15x FY24E core earnings and discounted value of stake in various listed entities. Under present business visibility, we see limited scope for further earnings upgrades, resulting in limited upside on present valuation levels, post MM having given ~60% return in past three months.   IRCTC share price: Shares of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation rally took a pause today after surging on last three successive sessions. IRCTC share price today opened downside and went to hit intraday low of ₹609.30 per share mark on NSE in early morning deals, logging around 1.50 per cent dip from its Tuesday close of ₹620 per share levels.   Asian stock markets fell on Wednesday, extending Wall Street's overnight losses amid concerns over inflation and the possibility of recession, which also boosted the safe-haven dollar. Japan's Nikkei index fell 0.98%, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.37%, dragged lower by Australian shares, off 0.81%, and Korea's KOSPI, down 1.54%. Asian shares had ended the Tuesday session on an upward trajectory after China announced an easing of its quarantine requirements for inbound passengers, in what some observers saw as the biggest relaxation so far of its ""zero COVID"" strategy. But the positive impact had petered out on Wednesday. ""Inevitably, markets tend to overreact to these sorts of news,"" said Carlos Casanova, senior economist at UBP in Hong Kong. ""In order for that to be sustainable, we really want to see these measures materialise into actual reopening."" Chinese blue chips, which hit a four month high the day before, lost 1.16% while the Hong Kong benchmark fell 1.83%.  EUROSTOXX 50 futures were down 0.57% and FTSE futures lost 0.68% before European markets opened. The losses in Asia followed a turbulent day on US markets, with the S&P 500 index down more than 2% after data showed US consumer confidence dropped to a 16-month low in June due to fears high inflation could cause the economy to slow significantly in the second half of the year.   Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani stepped down on Tuesday from the role of director of the telecoms arm of Reliance Industries in favour of his son Akash, setting the stage for a leadership transition at his energy-to-retail conglomerate. The change was disclosed in a regulatory filing by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which said Mukesh's 30-year-old son and non-executive director Akash was being appointed chairman of the board. The move comes after Ambani, who ranks among the world's top 10 billionaires, first signaled last year that his children would have significant roles in the family's business empire. Reliance is ""in the process of effecting a momentous leadership transition,"" he said at an event in December. Akash's twin sister Isha is a director on the boards of Jio as well as Reliance Retail, which houses the conglomerate's ambitious bets in India's brick-and-mortar space. The youngest of the siblings, Anant, sits on the board of renewable energy and oil and chemical units of Reliance as a director.   We re-iterate BUY on Century Plyboards (CPBI) as demand continues to remain healthy for wood panel products. Our recent interaction with dealers and the management of Century Plyboards (CPBI) indicates that in the currently ongoing Q1FY23, demand trends are steady across segments like plywood, laminates and MDF on continued pick-up in residential market and higher spend on home improvement post the pandemic. CPBI has taken price increase of ~2-4% in plywood segment and ~3-4% in laminates during Q1FY23, which should enable it to mitigate the raw material price pressures and thus, enable margin to remain steady going ahead. CPBI management had earlier guided for 15-25% revenue growth across segments in FY23. We maintain estimates and our BUY rating on the stock with an unchanged Mar’23E target price of Rs747.   We reiterate our BUY ratings on Indian Hotels Co. Ltd. (IHCL) and Lemon Tree Hotels (LTH). For IHCL, we have a target price of Rs284/share, valuing the stock at 22x Jun’24E EV/EBITDA. For LTH, we have a target price of Rs84/share, valuing the stock at 20x Mar’24E EV/EBITDA.   Shares of Century Plyboards India Ltd have been under pressure recently, after scaling a new 52-week high of ₹749 in March. Concerns about persistent high raw material inflation have weighed on investor sentiment for the stock. So far in this calendar year, the stock has corrected by around 15% on the National Stock Exchange.   After the G-7 leaders agreed to curb Russian oil imports to limit the energy proceeds that Kremlin uses to finance its war machines in Ukraine the country's fuel prices have gone up due to strong demand from Asia. But should India be worried?   Domestic brokerage and research firm IIFL has retained its positive stance on Deepak Fertilisers shares, as at 10x FY23ii P/E, it continues to find valuations attractive. While nitric-acid realisations and spreads are expected to sustain in FY23, TAN spreads may soften. Thus, EPS growth in FY23 is expected to be muted, the brokerage highlighted in a note.   Traders in India’s foreign-exchange market are bracing for more instances of dollar shortages, as record outflows from the nation’s equities and deteriorating external finances bite. Some Mumbai-based banks saw a dollar crunch last week, as outflows from Indian assets add to the pressure, according to Mizuho Bank Ltd. and IFA Global. The rupee dropped to a record low against the greenback on Wednesday. Foreign investors have pulled $28 billion from Indian equities this year, while higher oil import costs and a widening current account deficit mean that everybody from investors to companies are demanding dollar for their rupee at the same time. The Reserve Bank of India said last Friday it’s trying to meet the demand through its reserves.   Rakesh Jhunjhunwala portfolio: After climbing to life-time high of ₹268.95 on NSE in April 2022, Indian Hotels Company shares are under base building phase. However, the stock has a history of giving strong return to its shareholders in long term. In last 20 years, this Rakesh Jhunjhunwala stock has ascended from ₹13.85 to ₹228.10 apiece levels, giving compound annual growth rate or CAGR of near 15 per cent over this period of two decades.   Isha Ambani is set to be named chairman of the Reliance conglomerate’s retail unit in another sign that her father, Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, is pushing ahead with a plan for succession in one of Asia’s richest families.   Stock market of India has been under sell-off heat after the outbreak of Russia-Ukraine war. In YTD time, both Nifty and Sensex have corrected more than 10 per cent whereas small-cap index has corrected over 16 per cent in 2022. So, positional investors looking for value picks available at discounted price may get lured towards small-cap stocks for higher returns when the market rebounds.   Domestic equity indices declined substantially in the opening session of Wednesday due to consistent depreciation of rupee, foreign fund outflows, prevailing inflation concerns, among others. Indian currency rupee has been consistently hitting fresh all-time lows. The renewed rise in global crude oil prices too have a negative bearing on the market sentiments, said analysts. On Tuesday, the indices closed steady, while they have declined during the majority of the sessions so far in June. At 10.00 a.m on Wednesday, Sensex was at 52,844.78 points, down 332.67 points or 0.63%, whereas Nifty at 15,749.35 points, down 100.85 points or 0.64%.   The Indian rupee weakened further on Wednesday, touching record lows against the U.S. dollar as losses in domestic shares and other Asian currencies weighed on sentiment. The partially convertible rupee was trading at 78.94/95 per dollar by 0409 GMT, after touching a lifetime low of 78.95. The currency closed at 78.77 on Tuesday. Traders said the rupee could weaken towards 79 per dollar during the session, but the central bank is expected to intervene to slow the slide in the currency.   2Wheeler stocks have outperformed Nifty by 11-33% since Feb 2022 . However, stocks have still lagged Nifty by 33-77% since Jan 2018 due to demand downturn and EV concern. While the latter concern will continue until clarity on EV market shares emerges, Jefferies believes stocks are attractive for the impending demand recovery.   Stocks dropped in Asia on Wednesday on renewed worries about a gloomy economic outlook as monetary policy tightens in much of the world to fight high inflation. An Asian equity index snapped a four-day climb, shedding more than 1%. US futures steadied after a tech-led tumble in the S&P 500 on Tuesday. Institutional portfolio rebalancing may be impacting trading. China’s bourses were in the red too but the losses were relatively modest. In a surprise move, the nation Tuesday reduced quarantine times for inbound travelers. That hinted at an eventual shift away from a strategy of stamping out Covid that involves great economic cost via lockdowns and travel curbs.   A total of two stocks have been put under the ban for trade on Wednesday, June 29, 2022 under the futures and options (F&O) segment by the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

Adani Power shares are one of the multibagger stocks in 2022 that Indian stock market has produced despite global economy reeling under the pressure of inflation and gloomy economy outlook. In YTD time, Adani Power share price has surged from around ₹101 to ₹270 apiece levels on NSE, recording around 165 per cent rise in 2022.

Shares of the firm slumped 11% to $55.96 on Monday, extending their decline this year to 78% as Bitcoin trades at less than half its value from just six months ago. Goldman analyst William Nance cited the “continued downdraft in crypto prices"" and the broader drop in activity levels across the industry. Coinbase had fallen 75% this year prior to the downgrade.   The rupee plunged by 48 paise to close at record low of 78.85 (provisional) against the US dollar on Tuesday, weighed down by persistent foreign capital outflows and a surge in crude oil prices. At the interbank foreign exchange market, the rupee opened lower at 78.53 against the greenback and finally settled at 78.85, down 48 paise over its previous close. During the session, the rupee touched an all-time low of 78.8550 against the American currency.   The dollar climbed on Tuesday while the euro faltered after European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde offered no fresh insight into the central bank's policy outlook. The ECB is widely expected to follow its global peers by raising interest rates in July to try to check soaring inflation though economists are divided on the magnitude of any rate hike. The euro held below $1.06 after Lagarde said the central bank would move gradually but with the option to act decisively on any deterioration in medium-term inflation, especially if there were signs of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations.   Gold inched down on Wednesday in range-bound trading, as sustained strength in the dollar kept investors away from greenback-priced bullion. Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1,818.74 per ounce by 0105 GMT. US gold futures also eased 0.1% to $1,820.30.

The Reserve Bank of India said last Friday it’s trying to meet the demand through its reserves.   Oil prices fell on Wednesday after rising in the previous three sessions but losses were limited on the view that global supply tightness will continue as there is limited room for major producers such as Saudi Arabia to boost production. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures slid 44 cents, or 0.4%, to $111.32 a barrel at 0150 GMT, giving up earlier gains. Brent crude futures for August dropped 61 cents, or 0.5%, to $117.37 a barrel, also reversing an earlier gain. The August contract will expire on Thursday and the more-active September contract was at $113.14, down 66 cents, or 0.6%.   US consumer confidence slipped to its lowest level in 16 months as persistent inflation and rising interest rates have Americans as pessimistic as they’ve been about the future in almost a decade. The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index slipped to 98.7 in June from 103.2 in May and the second straight monthly decline and the lowest level since February 2021.

Monthly and quarterly institutional portfolio rebalancing may be impacting trading. The dollar held gains after rising the most in more than a week in the Wall Street session amid disquiet over evaporating US consumer confidence. Treasuries were steady, leaving the 10-year yield at 3.18%. The risk of an American recession overshadowed China’s surprise move Tuesday to reduce quarantine times for inbound travelers. The step had lifted markets on hopes of a shift away from a strategy of stamping out Covid that comes with great economic cost via repeated lockdowns. Oil pushed past $112 a barrel on supply risks. In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin wallowed around $20,000 amid generally poor sentiment.   Tokyo stocks opened lower on Wednesday, extending falls on Wall Street as a gloomy US consumer confidence report offset positive news about China's move to scale back Covid-19 restrictions. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was down 0.67 percent, or 235.88 points, at 26,813.59 in early trade, while the broader Topix index slipped 0.79 percent, or 14.98 points, to 1,892.40.   Australian shares fell on Wednesday, with selling seen across most sub-sectors, as a drop in June US consumer confidence dampened investor sentiment amid a slew of interest-rate hikes globally and recession worries. Data released on Tuesday morning showed the US consumer confidence index dropping to the lowest since February 2021, with near-term expectations reaching their most pessimistic level in nearly a decade. That dragged the S&P/ASX 200 index down 1.2% to 6,681.1 by 0053 GMT, and putting it on track to snap a four-day winning streak. The benchmark had added 0.9% in the previous session.

The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.28 percent, or 9.53 points, to 3,399.68, while the Shenzhen Composite Index on China's second exchange also fell 0.28 percent, or 6.38 points, to 2,237.54.   Wall Street closed sharply lower in a broad sell-off on Tuesday as dire consumer confidence data dampened investor optimism and fueled worries over recession and the looming earnings season. The S&P and the Nasdaq fell about 2% and 3% respectively, with Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com weighing the heaviest. The blue-chip Dow shed about 1.6%. ""Markets were fine today until the consumer confidence number came out,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""It was weak and markets immediately began selling off."" With the end of the month and the second quarter two days away, the benchmark S&P 500 is on track for its biggest first-half percentage drop since 1970. All three indexes are on course to notch two straight quarterly declines for the first time since 2015. Data released on Tuesday morning showed the Conference Board's consumer confidence index dropping to the lowest it has been since February 2021, with near-term expectations reaching its most pessimistic level in nearly a decade.

Nifty 50 index added 132 points and closed at 15,832 levels whereas BSE Sensex surged 433 points and closed at 53,161 levels. Nifty Bank index ended 183 points higher at 33,811 levels. According to stock market experts, the crucial overhead resistance of 15,800 levels (previous swing lows, as per the concept of change in polarity) has been taken out on the upside. But, the lack of further upside post upside breakout and a formation of range bound action subsequently after the opening could dampen the effort of bulls to sustain the highs. Day trading guide for stock market today Speaking on day trading guide for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said, ""The short term trend of Nifty continues to be positive. Display of lack of strength to sustain the highs during upside breakout is likely to result in further consolidation or downward correction from the highs.

Updated: 23 Jun 2022,How corporates are helping achieve 86% of PM Modi's climate goals by 2030,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/how-corporates-are-helping-achieve-86-of-pm-modi-s-climate-goals-by-2030-11655958606712.html,"India wants non-fossil fuel power sources to provide half of its electricity supply by 2030. To achieve this target, the country needs to massively scale up funding for renewables and to meet its goals by 2030 investment of $223 billion is needed, according to a new report by research company BloombergNEF (BNEF). At COP26 in November 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced India's plans to reduce emission intensity by more than 45% by 2030 below 2005 levels, and called out five decarbonisation targets, terming them ‘panchamrit’(nectar distilled from five ingredients; in this case, the five promises). To sum-up the five nectars Prime Minister Narendra Modi had stated, ""First- India will reach its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030. Second- India will meet 50 percent of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030. Third- India will reduce the total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now onwards till 2030. Fourth- By 2030, India will reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by less than 45 percent. And fifth- by the year 2070, India will achieve the target of Net-Zero. These panchamrits will be an unprecedented contribution of India to climate action."" According to India's Central Electricity Authority forecast, reliance on coal will drop from 53 percent of installed capacity in 2021 to 33 percent in 2030, whereas solar and wind together make up 51 percent by then, up from 23 percent in 2021. India’s power generation capacity grew by 118% between 2011 and 2021. Renewables share of capacity reached 37% in 2021 from 31% in 2012. Solar power has expanded the fastest reaching 60GW in 2021 from less than 1GW in 2011. The report “Financing India’s 2030 Renewables Ambition"" has been published in association with the Power Foundation of India. India has already invested around $ 75 billion in renewable energy in the past eight years between 2014 to 2021 to install 165 GW of renewable energy which now needs to treble to $ 223 billion to meet India’s 500 GW goal by 2030, the report said. ● $363 billion of investments would be needed in building new power projects and batteries between 2020 and 2029 to meet the CEA’s 2030 optimal capacity mix. ● Out of this, from 2020 to 2029: $241 billion would be needed to build solar and wind power plants and another $26 billion to build battery storage projects. ● In 2020 and 2021, new-build wind and solar together secured $17.4 billion of asset financing. So, an average of $27.9 billion is required annually from 2022 to 2029 to meet the 2030 targets. The report concludes that corporate commitments from Indian companies could help India achieve 86 per cent of its 2030 goals of building 500 GW of cumulative non-fossil power generation capacity. Several big corporates are contributing in India's path to achieve 2030 climate goals with the top-10 independent power producers have 33GW renewables commissioned and 46GW in the pipeline Reliance is leading the pack with objective to invest $10bn to create a renewable energy ecosystem by 2024 and would have built and enabled100GW solar systems. Adani Group aims to be world's largest solar power company by 2025 and world's largest renewable power company by 2030. Tata Power plans to build 25 GW green energy portfolio, JSW to add 15GW renewables with $10bn plan by 2030 and NTPC targets 60GW renewables by 2032. To meet its climate goals of wind and solar capacity installations by 2030 India needs to invest  India will need to invest $223 billion in order to meet its goal of wind and solar capacity installations by 2030, according to a new report by research company BloombergNEF (BNEF). The goal is part of the five decarbonisation targets that had been announced by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at COP26 in November 2021. Additionally, India aims to meet 50 percent of its electricity demand from renewable energy, thereby making renewable energy especially crucial in meeting the country’s 2030 and 2070 climate goals. The report “Financing India’s 2030 Renewables Ambition"", published in association with the Power Foundation of India, finds that corporate commitments from Indian companies could help India achieve 86 percent of its 2030 goals of building 500 GW of cumulative non-fossil power generation capacity. By 2021 165 GW of zero-carbon generation had already been installed in the country. India's Central Electricity Authority forecasts the country's reliance on coal to drop from 53 percent of installed capacity in 2021 to 33 percent in 2030, whereas solar and wind together make up 51 percent by then, up from 23 percent in 2021. India has consistently ranked among the leading emerging markets covered by Climatescope, BNEF’s flagship report analysing market attractiveness for energy transition investment. In 2021, India ranked first in the power category among 107 emerging markets. Transparent market mechanisms, supportive policies and ambitious government targets have attracted many domestic and international players to India’s renewables market."
Updated: 22 Jun 2022,Coal-based electricity generation backbone of India's power sector: NTPC chief,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/coalbased-electricity-generation-backbone-of-india-s-power-sector-ntpc-chief-11655918708361.html,"Amid the reports of coal shortage and power outages in the country, state-run power giant NTPC's Chairman and Managing Director Gurdeep Singh on 22 June said that coal-based electricity generation is the backbone of power supply and is going to stay this way for the next two-three decades. Singh, who was participating in a panel discussion at the BloombergNEF Summit in the national capital, was of the view that instead of talking about phasing out coal-based thermal power plants, India needs to focus on dispatchable renewable energy. ""Why are people too much concerned about coal? Today we are supplying three-fourths of the electricity from coal-based plants. These coal-based power plants are the backbone (of power supply in the country or baseload),"" he said. ALSO READ: NTPC augments coal from own sources ""What we need to look at is how to reduce coal-based generation rather than phase down or phase out coal-based power plants. Let's now talk about that. It is too early to talk about that (phasing out coal-based plants). I think coal (based power) it is going to stay for two to three decades,"" he added. Meanwhile, India has set a target of having 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030. Among other things, the NTPC chief opined that the country needs to make this renewable energy dispatchable and reliable. But, he stressed more on the importance of making affordable and reliant 24X7 power on demand for consumers. ""My concern is that we may have to start new coal-based power plants to meet the requirement,"" Singh said. On way to help reduce fossil fuel-based electricity consumption, Singh suggested the economical solar and wind energy can complement coal-based thermal power during the day. Also, he was of the view of having new efficient and environment-friendly coal-based thermal power plants rather than running old and inefficient ones. ALSO READ: Coal stock at over 52 MT; enough for 24 days' requirement of power plants Apart from these, the NTPC MD said it is important that low cost long-term funding is made available in the country to accelerate the growth of renewable energy. The state-run power giant NTPC supplies one-fourth of the electricity in India. It is also entering the hydro, solar and wind energy segments and aims to have 60 GW of renewable energy capacity in the next decade. With inputs from PTI."

Ashok Leyland: Commercial vehicle maker Ashok Leyland’s electric mobility arm, Switch Mobility, expects an orderbook pipeline of 1,000 electric buses by the end of this financial year, feeding the significant demand boom for electric buses for public transit that India is witnessing. The company is also aiming to launch its electrified range of light commercial vehicles within this fiscal. PNB Housing Finance: Will raise up to ₹2,000 crore by issuing bonds on a private placement basis.

Updated: 14 Jun 2022,"Sensex ends in the red, Nifty below 15,750; oil and gas stocks top drags",https://www.livemint.com/market/live-blog/share-market-live-updates-sensex-nifty-bse-nse-stock-market-today-14-06-2022-ril-viacom-ipl-zomato-srei-11655171309721.html,"India's equity markets were volatile on Tuesday, swinging between gains and losses. Investors now await the US Fed's next policy announcement, due Wednesday, for clues on how aggressive the central bank intends to be in raising rates.  India's benchmark equity indices ended Tuesday lower, but off lows, tracking global peers and as domestic inflation data cemented the case for more rate hikes, going ahead. High global energy and raw material prices combined with a weak rupee fuelled the fastest annual rise in India's annual wholesale price-based inflation to 15.88% in May. US equity futures pared gains on Tuesday and a rebound in European stocks proved short-lived, suggesting markets aren’t out of the woods after a rout driven by expectations of sharper Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes to fight inflation. Back home, the benchmark Sensex fell 153.13 points to end the session at 52,693.57, while the Nifty was down 42.30 points at 15,732.10.  Realty, metal indices rose, while auto and oil and gas stocks fell. The midcaps and the smallcaps also ended with minor cuts.   High global energy and raw material prices combined with a weak rupee fueled the fastest annual rise in India's wholesale prices in more than 30 years, raising expectations for the central bank to order more interest rate hikes. A surge in crude oil and commodity prices since Russia invaded Ukraine in February has set inflation alight in many countries, forcing central banks to raise interest rates. Wholesale prices, akin to producer prices, climbed 15.88% in May from year ago levels, staying in double-digits for a 14th straight month, and was, according to economists, India's highest since September 1991.   Aviation regulator DGCA on Tuesday said it has imposed a fine of ₹10 lakh on Air India for denying boarding to passengers holding valid tickets and thereafter not providing mandatory compensation to them. ""After that a series of checks were carried out by DGCA and during our surveillance at Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Delhi, there were specific instances, in the case of Air India - where the regulation (regarding compensation to passengers) is not being followed and therefore, a show cause notice was issued to the airline and also a personal hearing was afforded,"" the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said in a statement. According to the regulator, Air India may not have a policy in this regard and does not pay compensation to the passengers.   The U.S. dollar consolidated gains near a 20-year peak on Tuesday while its rivals from the Aussie to the euro nursed steep losses as traders braced for aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve this week. Expectations for a 75 basis-point increase at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday are nearly baked into prices, according to CME's Fedwatch Tool with investment banks like Goldman Sachs expecting a 75 basis-point rate hike in June and July, and a 50 basis-point rise in September. A 75 basis-point increase would be the biggest since 1994 and with world stock markets nursing deep losses, the dollar's appeal as a safe-haven asset is also boosting its allure.   The Indian government’s spending on information technology is expected to grow 12.1% to $9.5 billion in 2022, far higher than the 5% rise globally, according to Gartner, Inc. The research firm estimates government IT spends for the year globally to touch $565.7 billion. “Contrary to the worldwide spending, all segments will experience growth in India in 2022,"" Apeksha Kaushik, principal analyst, Gartner, said in an interview.  Global geopolitical tensions and looming recession in the US are not expected to have much impact on India, she added. While software spends by the Union government will grow at the fastest pace globally at a record 28% and cross the $2 billion mark in 2022, IT services is likely to post 13.4% growth to hit $2.4 billion.     European stocks edged higher from their lowest level in over a year as investors bought the dip after a global rout sparked by worries of aggressive central bank policy tightening amid stubbornly high inflation. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was up 0.3% after slumping Monday to its lowest since March 2021. Banks led the advance with rate-sensitive sectors outperforming following a dip in Treasury yields. Insurance and energy stocks also rose, while real estate declined.   Bajaj Finance Limited, the lending and investing arm of Bajaj Finserv, has increased the interest rates on its fixed deposit (FD) programme by up to 20 basis points (bps), for tenors between 24 to 60 months (except 44 months).    Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked various government departments and ministries to undertake the recruitment of 10 lakh people on a ""mission mode"" in the next year and a half, his office said on Tuesday. The direction from Modi came following a review of the status of human resources in all government departments and ministries, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said. The government's decision comes amid the opposition's frequent criticism of it on the issue of unemployment. A large number of vacant posts in different government sectors has often been flagged.   India's palm oil imports in May fell 10% from a month ago as top producer Indonesia curbed exports of the edible oil, a trade body said on Tuesday. The south Asian country is the world's biggest importer of vegetable oils and lower purchases could weigh on Malaysian palm oil futures. India imported 514,022 tonnes of palm oil in May, down from 572,508 tonnes in April, according to the Solvent Extractors' Association (SEA) of India. Indonesia, the world's biggest producer and exporter of palm oil, on April 28 halted exports of the product to control soaring prices at home. Jakarta allowed exports to resume from May 23, but put in place policies to safeguard domestic supplies. Indian refiners in May sourced more palm oil from Malaysia, Thailand and Papua New Guinea, but still the overall imports were down, the SEA said.   Nifty The Nifty began the new week with heavy losses amid weak global cues and closed below 15800 level. All sectoral indices closed deep in the red with IT, media and metal being top losers. Ahead of the FOMC meeting, we expect the Nifty to remain subdued. It may face resistance at higher levels due to aggressive writing at ATM and OTM Call strikes. Bank Nifty The Bank Nifty also witnessed selling pressure in line with the Nifty and closed with a loss of more than 1100 points. Looking at options data, the Bank Nifty’s immediate support is at 33000 while on the higher side, 34000 Call strike will act as resistance and limit upside gains.     Inspite of a strong demand outlook for IT services providers, worsening global macro economic scenario raises concern of a recession. For IT sector, this could translate into lower client spending, thus weighing on demand pipeline beyond FY23. Striking a note of caution, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said, ""Profit warning from clients of IT companies and increasing external risks makes the assumption of 6-8% global IT spending growth, unreasonable. We moderate our stance and bake in normalized global IT spending growth of 3-4% for CY2023E and 7% for CY2022E.""

French energy company TotalEnergies said on Tuesday it has agreed to buy a 25% stake in Adani New Industries Limited (ANIL) as part of a deal to form a new green hydrogen project in India with the Adani company. TotalEnergies, one of the world's biggest oil and gas producers, has faced criticism from climate activists and has been moving into the renewable energy sector and diversifying away from hydrocarbon-centred activities in recent years.   Indonesia on Tuesday issued regulations backing recently announced changes on a palm oil export tax policy, including cutting the maximum levy rate to accelerate shipments that have been slow to rebound after the ending of an export ban. But the levy rate will be raised in August, according to the finance ministry regulations, sparking concerns from an industry group. Indonesia, the world's biggest palm oil exporter, allowed palm shipments to resume from May 23 following a three-week export ban designed to boost cooking oil stocks and keep runaway local prices in check. Authorities have since launched an export acceleration programme and tweaked tax rules after shipments were slow to restart amid confusion over procedural issues. Details of Tuesday's regulations were in line with previous announcements, including lowering the maximum levy rate for crude palm oil to $200 a tonne from $375, effective until 31 July.   Bitcoin extended declines on Tuesday as investor sentiment took another leg down over fears that bigger Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes loom to quell inflation. The world’s largest digital token shed as much as 10.3% to reach $20,824, the lowest level since December 2020. A range of other tokens from Ether to Avalanche were also nursing losses.   Gold hovered near a four-week low on Tuesday, as some bears looked to book profits, but prices remained largely pressured by a strong dollar and investors dumping bullion to cover for losses in other assets. Amid prospects of aggressive monetary policy tightening, spot gold rose 0.4% to $1,825.97 per ounce, in Asian deals, after falling to its lowest since May 19 at $1,810.90 earlier in the session.   The market crashed with full force on the first day of the week, as benchmark indices slumped below their crucial levels on across-the-board selling pressure. There have been heightened concerns amongst investors that central banks will be more aggressive in the coming months to hike interest rate hikes in order to combat inflation, which will in turn hurt economic growth and put margins under pressure. Markets were also down due to continued strength in Brent crude prices, 10-year bond yields rising to 3.20% from recent lows of 2.80%, and the expected CPI numbers. The fear and uncertainty was clearly visible in India's VIX, which is up over 15% at 22.50.  Technically, if the Nifty breaks and closes below 15700, it will be a major downside event for the market. In such a situation, the index would fall to the level of 15500-15400 in the short term. It is advisable to reduce a weak long position below the 15700 level. Also, Bank Nifty could drop to 32000 level if it ends below 33500.   Oil prices seesawed in positive and negative territory on Tuesday, holding up despite recession fears and potential new COVID-19 curbs in China that could dampen demand as the market remains tightly supplied. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude eased 4 cents to $120.89 a barrel in early deals, while Brent crude futures dipped 6 cents to $122.21 a barrel.   Retail inflation eased in May from the eight-year high it hit the previous month but remained well above the central bank’s upper tolerance level, adding pressure on policymakers to tame unrelenting price rise. Consumer Price Index inflation moderated to 7.04% in May from 7.79% in April, helped by slower increases in food prices, data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) showed on Monday.

Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange fell 117.50 points, or 0.74%, to 15,661.00 in early deals on Tuesday, indicating a negative start for Indian benchmarks. India's benchmark equity indices slumped over 2.5% on Monday amid a sell-off in global markets. The rupee plunged 20 paise to close at an all-time low of 78.13 against the US dollar, as a lacklustre trend in domestic equities and stronger greenback overseas weighed on investor sentiment. The Sensex fell 1,456.74 points to end the day at 52,846.70, having touched an intraday low of 52,527.08. The Nifty was down 427.40 points or 2.64% at 15,774.40.    Asian shares tumbled on Tuesday after Wall Street hit a confirmed bear market milestone and bond yields struck a two-decade high on fears aggressive U.S. interest rate hikes would push the world's largest economy into recession. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.9%. Australian shares S&P/ASX200 sank 5% in early trade, while Japan's Nikkei stock index was down 1.74%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index slipped 1.44% and China's CSI300 Index was down nearly 1% at open. US futures steadied in the wake of a three-day rout in the S&P 500 of nearly 9%. Robust earnings from technology bellwether Oracle Corp. lifted battered tech shares in extended US trading. On the Wall Street on Monday, the S&P 500 fell 151.23 points to 3,749.63 and dropped 21.8% below its record set early this year to put it into what investors call a bear market. The S&P 500 has lost nearly 9% in just three days. That’s its worst such stretch since the earliest days of the coronavirus crash in March 2020.  The Dow lost 876.05, or 2.8%, to 30,516.74 on Monday, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 530.80, or 4.7% to 10,809.23.  "
Updated: 10 Jun 2022,4 power sector stocks to watch next week as suggested by HDFC Securities,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/4-power-sector-stocks-to-watch-next-week-as-suggested-by-hdfc-securities-11654882404065.html,"The brokerage firm HDFC Securities has given an eye on the power sector and has picked up Borosil Renewable with an 'Add' rating, NTPC with a buy rating, Tata Power with a reduce rating, and JSW Energy with a sell rating, believing that India will add 342GW of RES capacity between FY22 and FY30, led by solar +280GW, representing a capex potential of INR11.2 trillion. HDFC Securities has said in a note that “Renewables are poised to play a huge role in India’s energy sector, with capacity increasing fourfold by 2030, aided by stringent Renewable Power Obligation (RPO) standards, decarbonisation efforts, and increasing power demand. However, the success of RES will require the penetration of hybrid structures (rather than plain vanilla tenders) along with viable storage systems to ensure peak power requirement and grid stability. Another major leap that India and other global economies are pursuing is green hydrogen, which will replace the conventional pollutant fuel in the fertilizer, ammonia, steel, marine, refinery and heavy vehicle industries but not in the passenger vehicle segment."" The brokerage has said India would require ~21GW of electrolyser capacity by FY30 to meet it’s anticipated ~4MT of green hydrogen demand, which will be powered by ~80GW of RES capacity. The RES growth would require ~INR20 trillion of funding over the next decade. “In our view, NTPC (BUY), Borosil Renewables (ADD) and Tata Power (REDUCE) will be key listed beneficiaries and should be considered for long-term investment play,"" HDFC Securities has said. “We expect India will add ~342GW of RES capacity over FY22-FY30, led by solar +280GW which represents a capex opportunity of INR11.2 trillion (debt funding of INR9.0trillion). Higher RPO obligation of 40% (vs 20% now), which would push discoms to sign renewable PPAs. The bankability would improve with hybrid projects as it ensures RTC power. Companies with a large portfolio of hybrid and storage facilities will attract better valuations,"" the report of the brokerage says. The brokerage has further claimed that “We expect that the mega transition from grey to green energy, along with favourable policies, will provide a strong impetus to domestic manufacturers to make RES a sustainable and competitive industry. Further, the viability of storage and green hydrogen will play a key role in the success and mass-scale adoption of RES energy in the system. However, any failure or delay in lowering storage costs or finding another viable alternative could significantly derail the country’s renewable adoption program."" The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint."

Indian investors turned cautious, expecting RBI to hike interest rate to curb inflation, while global investors are keeping an eye on US inflation data and key rate decision in Europe. Globally, stock markets were mixed on Tuesday after a bond sell-off on Wall Street fuelled anxiety about a possible US economic slowdown, while oil prices were stable on China easing Covid curbs. Shares rose marginally in Japan and Shanghai, while it fell in Hong Kong, South Korea, and Australia.  Indian indices on Monday closed significantly lower, extending run of losses, dragged by heavy selling pressure in consumer durables, capital goods, and realty stocks. The Sensex fell 567.98 points, or 1.02%, to close at 55,107.34, while Nifty50 declined 153.20 points to end at 16,416.35. Sectorally, IT, realty, pharma, consumer durables, among others, came under heavy selling pressure, while energy, oil & gas, and power sectors ended in the green. On the 30-stock index, the most gains were made by NTPC and Maruti, while Titan, DRL, HUL, and L&T were among the biggest losers. On Nifty50, ONGC, Coal, India, and NTPC ended higher, while Titan, DRL, and UPL were among the biggest laggards.   Global stock markets were mixed Tuesday after a bond sell-off on Wall Street fuelled anxiety about a possible U.S. economic slowdown and Australia raised interest rates. London, Shanghai and Hong Kong declined. Frankfurt opened higher and Tokyo gained. The yen, trading at two-decade lows, fell further to almost 133 to the dollar. Wall Street futures were lower after the benchmark S&P 500 index rose 0.3% on Monday and the market price of a 10-year Treasury bond fell. That increased its yield, or the difference between the day's price and the payout at maturity.   Oil prices were stable on Tuesday as the market balanced risk sentiment with supply concerns and the prospect of higher demand as China relaxes its COVID curbs. Brent crude futures were down 38 cents, or 0.3%, at $119.13 barrel at 0926 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 25 cents, or 0.2%, at $118.25 a barrel, having risen by over $1 per barrel earlier in the session.   Asian equities' valuations dropped to a more than two-year low at the end of May, as regional shares were hit by concerns over monetary tightening measures by major central banks and supply chain disruptions. The MSCI Asia-Pacific index's forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) stood at 12.6 at the end of last month, the lowest since March 2020, according to Refinitiv data. Regional shares have faced bigger declines this year, as higher inflation levels stoked recession worries and lockdowns in China pushed manufacturers in countries ranging from Japan to South Korea to slow production activity. The data showed the MSCI World index's P/E stood at 15.3 at the end of last month, pushing its valuation premium over the MSCI Asia-Pacific to 21%, much higher than the 10-year average of 14.8%.   Since analysts at JPMorgan downgraded its Indian IT sector stance to underweight on 18 May, 2022, India IT performance has been volatile. Despite the recent sharp correction seen in IT stocks, Indian IT companies are still trading at around 40% premium to pre-Covid average multiples.   Crude oil prices on Tuesday rose by ₹14 to ₹9,239 per barrel as participants widened positions on a firm spot demand.

Marketmen said raising of positions by participants amid a rising demand from cattle-feed makers mainly influenced cottonseed oil cake prices.   The U.S. dollar rose to a two-week high as rising U.S. Treasury yields supported the greenback, pushing the Japanese yen to its lowest level against the dollar in two decades. The yen dropped to a 20-year low of 133 per dollar, levels that had previously been highlighted as intervention territory, a day after central bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated an unwavering commitment to ""powerful"" monetary stimulus. The yen is sensitive to interest rate differentials between Japanese debt and U.S. bonds. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields had climbed as high as 3.064% in Tokyo trading for the first time in almost four weeks, before slipping back to 3.0307%. Spreads between 10-year U.S. and Japanese debt held at 278 bps, not far from a 3-1/2 year high of 292 bps hit last month.   European stocks fell with U.S. futures Tuesday as investors dumped risk assets as central banks resolute on tightening policy fanned growth fears. The dollar advanced and bond yields stabilized. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped as telecom and technology stocks weighed. In the UK, the export-heavy FTSE 100 was little changed as the pound slid on concerns about the nation’s growth and risks to Boris Johnson’s leadership. Investors are reluctant to take on risk and volatility remains elevated. Equities are struggling to mount a sustainable rebound amid fears policy makers need to be even more aggressive in their withdrawal of stimulus to rein in inflation, hurting the economy and corporate earnings.   Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said retail investors seem to act as shock absorbers even when foreign portfolio investors continued to pull away amid volatility in stock market as there has been a very significant increase in retail investor numbers during the pandemic.   Traders lose more to impact costs than to brokerage and taxes when trading large quantities, therefore online brokerage firm Zerodha has introduced Iceberg orders which aims to help reduce impact costs.   Gold could be heading for another rally, with warnings over a global economic slowdown paving the way for a fresh push toward $2,000 an ounce.

Spot gold was little changed at $1,842.46 per ounce, as of 0442 GMT, trading in a tight $5 range. Earlier in the session, bullion touched $1,836.10, its lowest since June 1. U.S. gold futures were steady at $1,844.90.   Analysts at JPMorgan believe a sustained improvement in the profit margin contribution (Q4F22 35%) at Paytm seen over the last 2Qs sets the stage for operating leverage Q2F23 onwards as indirect costs moderate - resulting in a consistent downtrend in Adjusted EBITDA loss and an eventual path to breakeven.

According to stock market experts, sell-off in Aarti Industries shares is due to the weak global sentiments as the chemical company has reported 45 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in revenue and 42 per cent YoY rise in PAT (Profit After Tax).   In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin price today fell below $30,000 after advanced back above the $31,000 mark in the previous session. The world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency plunged more than 4% and was trading at $29,370.   SBI Cards and Payment Services (SBI Card) on Monday said its board has approved a proposal to raise ₹2,500 crore by issuing non-convertible debentures (NCDs) to fund business growth.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala portfolio: In recent sell-off, a good number of quality shares in the Indian stock market have undergone heavy correction. Tata Communications shares are one of them.

According to stock market experts, Tata Communications share price looks positive for long term positional investors as its order book has improved and the company has recently expressed confidence in its revenue growth recovery.   Copper prices slipped on Tuesday, weighed down by a stronger dollar, although demand revival hopes as top consumer China relaxed COVID-19 curbs, and declining inventories limited losses. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was down 0.6% at $9,682.50 a tonne, as of 0344 GMT. The most-traded July copper contract in Shanghai was down 0.1% at 72,690 yuan ($10,909.50) a tonne by the midday break.   The rupee depreciated 5 paise to 77.71 against the US dollar in opening trade on Tuesday, as heavy selling pressure in domestic equities and a strong greenback in the overseas market weighed on investor sentiments. In addition, investors remained concerned over rising crude prices and sustained foreign capital outflows, forex dealers said. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened weak at 77.72 against the US dollar, then recovered slightly to quote 77.71, registering a decline of 5 paise from the last close. In the previous session, the rupee had closed at 77.66 against the US dollar. On the domestic equity market front, the 30-share Sensex was trading 532.74 points or 0.96 per cent lower at 55,142.58, while the broader NSE Nifty declined 157.50 points or 0.95 per cent to 16,412.05.

Foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the capital market on Monday as they offloaded shares worth ₹2,397.65 crore, as per exchange data.   Japan's Nikkei index touched a more than two-month high on Tuesday, as automakers led gains after the U.S. dollar hit fresh 20-year highs. The Nikkei share average was up 0.4% at 28,024.40 by 0217 GMT, rising above the 28,000 level for the first time since March 31. The broader Topix rose 0.72% to 1,952.96. ""Automakers pushed the Nikkei above the 28,000-mark but it seems only limited amount of money is circulating around the market these days,"" said Shoichi Arisawa, general manager of the investment research department at IwaiCosmo Securities. ""The market has been struggling to rise in a broad rally and investors are targeting different sectors each day.""   Gold could be heading for another rally, with warnings over a global economic slowdown paving the way for a fresh push toward $2,000 an ounce. A potent mix of decades-high inflation, geopolitical turmoil and growing talk of recession should be bullish for the traditional haven, according to speakers interviewed ahead of a precious metals conference in Singapore this week. Bullion is down about 10% from a peak in mid-March, after the concerns that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine might sprawl into a broader conflict dissipated. But with top banking executives now warning about fresh economic shocks, the situation is ripe for stagflation, which would be bullish for gold.   As India’s monetary policy makers huddle to find ways to tame inflation, the question for them is not whether to raise borrowing costs, but by how much. The six-member Monetary Policy Committee will probably raise the benchmark interest rate by 40 basis points to 4.8% on Wednesday, according to the median in a Bloomberg survey of 37 economists. As of Monday, the poll returned what is easily the most varied number of predictions for hikes, ranging from 25 basis points to 75 basis points. With Wednesday’s policy decision following May’s surprise 40 basis-point off-cycle hike, expectations have narrowed down to the size of increase to tame inflation that’s been running above the central bank’s 2%-6% target band since the beginning of this year. Wholesale prices have gained at the fastest pace in over three decades, adding pressure on businesses to pass on high costs to consumers.   7 stocks to buy or sell today — 7th June   Wealth managers in Asia are holding back from offering digital assets to investors despite soaring demand due to a lack of understanding of these assets, according to an industry survey by consulting firm Accenture published on Monday. Global banks have been cautiously moving into crypto for several years, some building it within existing operations and others setting up new businesses. ""Currently, 52 percent of affluent investors in Asia hold digital assets of some sort. Accenture's research indicates this could reach 73 percent by the end of 2022,"" Accenture said on Monday. ""Digital assets represent 7% of surveyed investors' portfolios — making it the fifth-largest asset class in Asia — more than they allocate to foreign currencies, commodities or collectables. Yet two-thirds of wealth management firms have no plans to offer digital assets,"" Accenture said. The findings were part of Accenture's report on the future of Asia's wealth management industry based on two surveys - one of about 3,200 investors and another of more than 500 financial advisors at wealth management firms in Asia. The surveys were done in December 2021 and January 2022.   India's palm oil exports in May were its highest in seven months and up 15% on April as the country overcame curbs on Indonesian exports by sourcing more of the commodity from Malaysia, Thailand and Papua New Guinea, five industry officials said. Higher purchases by India, the world's biggest importer of vegetable oil, could support Malaysian palm oil prices, which are trading near a record high. India imported 660,000 tonnes of palm oil in May, up from 572,508 tonnes in April, according to the average estimate from five dealers. Indian imports from Indonesia fell in May, but refiners managed to buy more from Malaysia, Thailand and Papua New Guinea, said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive of Sunvin Group, a vegetable oil brokerage and consultancy.   The dollar continued its overnight rally into Asian trading hours on Tuesday, hitting fresh two-decade highs versus the yen, as worries about persistent inflation pushed up U.S. bond yields. The greenback also edged higher versus the euro, sterling and Swiss franc. It crept up, too, versus the Australian dollar, with the market split on whether the country's central bank will hike Australia's key interest rate later in the day by a quarter point or opt for something bigger. The Aussie weakened 0.15% to $0.7183, continuing its retreat from a six-week peak at $0.72825 reached last Friday. The dollar pushed as high as 132.305 yen on Tuesday - a level not seen since April 2002 - buoyed by the 10-year Treasury yield's rise to 3.05% for the first time in nearly four weeks. The currency pair last traded 0.17% higher at 132.12.   Asia's stock markets edged lower on Tuesday, the yen hit a 20-year low and bond markets wavered as investors nervously awaited U.S. inflation figures and central bank meetings in Australia, Europe and, next week, in the United States. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson survived a no-confidence vote among his Conservative Party's lawmakers on Monday, but gilts and Treasuries nursed losses from selling that began as talk of a move to replace him gathered steam through London and New York trade. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 9.9 basis points (bps) overnight and hit 3.0580% early in the Asia session. The move has pulled the dollar higher and poured cold water on initial optimism about China's emergence from COVID lockdowns.   London copper slipped on Tuesday, weighed down by a stronger dollar and as some investors took advantage of a sharp price rise in the previous session to book profits. * Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was down 0.5% at $9,692 a tonne, as of 0145 GMT, after rising 4.4% to its highest since April 27 at $9,916.19 on Monday. * The most-traded July copper contract in Shanghai was flat at 72,700 yuan ($10,909.85) a tonne.   Oil prices inched higher on Tuesday on expected demand recovery in China as it relaxed tough COVID curbs and doubts a higher output target by OPEC+ producers would ease tight supply. Brent crude futures were up 19 cents, or 0.2%, at $119.70 barrel at 0050 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 25 cents, or 0.2%, at $118.75 a barrel. The benchmark hit a three-month high of $120.99 on Monday. Easing travel restrictions in China are expected to boost demand for oil in the coming weeks, analysts from ANZ Research said in a note. Beijing and the commercial hub Shanghai have been returning to normal in recent days after two months of painful lockdowns to stem outbreaks of the Omicron variant. Traffic bans were lifted and restaurants were opened for dine-in service on Monday in most parts of Beijing.   Stocks in Asia traded mixed Tuesday as a jump in Treasury yields fueled concerns that rising borrowing costs will weigh on earnings and induce a recession. The yen sank to a 20-year low. Equities in Japan rose as the currency’s plunge on a widening interest-rate gap with the US provided a tailwind for exporters. Australian stocks dipped before a central bank meeting expected to deliver back-to-back rate increases for the first time in 12 years. Technology stocks in Hong Kong advanced on speculation the government may ease a crackdown on the sector. China fluctuated and US futures dropped. Treasuries added to losses that sent five- and 10-year yields over 3% for the first time since mid-May ahead of a slew of new debt supply before crucial inflation data at the end of the week. The 10-year Treasury yield inched up after jumping more than 10 basis points as yields across the curve advanced at least seven basis points Monday. The dollar gained as investors shunned risk assets. Bitcoin fell back below the $30,000 mark and the pound trimmed an advance spurred by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson surviving a leadership vote.   U.S. stocks ended a choppy session slightly higher on Monday, helped by gains in Amazon.com and other mega-cap growth shares, while persistent worries over inflation and interest rates kept a lid on the market. Shares of Amazon.com Inc rose 2% and were the biggest positive for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq after the online retailer split its shares 20 for 1. Apple Inc shares climbed 0.5%. The tech giant at its annual software developer conference announced among other things that it would more deeply integrate its software into the core driving systems of cars. Helping sentiment were easing regulatory crackdowns in China and signs in parts of China of a return to more normal activity after the country's biggest COVID-19 outbreak in two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 16.08 points, or 0.05%, to 32,915.78, the S&P 500 gained 12.89 points, or 0.31%, to 4,121.43 and the Nasdaq Composite added 48.64 points, or 0.4%, to 12,061.37.

Fake insurance call centre busted,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/beware-retired-ntpc-official-loses-rs-1-6-crore-fake-insurance-call-centre-busted-11654235768898.html,"NOIDA : With the arrest of 16 people, the Noida police on Thursday claimed to have busted a fake call centre which, among others, had duped a retired official of ₹1.62 crore on the pretext of getting him ₹26 lakh of an insurance policy back. Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Noida) Ranvijay Singh said the fake call centre was located in the Bhopura area of the adjoining Ghaziabad district. Among those arrested are the gang's kingpin and 10 women, who worked at the fake call centre, Singh said, adding that the case has been solved by the Noida Cyber Cell and Sector 113 police station officials. ""On May 21, a retired NTPC (National Thermal Power Corporation) official approached the Sector 113 police station with a complaint that he has been duped of ₹1.62 crore by some people over a period of time,"" Singh said. ""He had provided us with whatever documents and evidence he had related to the episode, after which a case was lodged and we took up the investigation. We have successfully busted a gang involved in this fraud and arrested 16 people,"" the police officer told reporters here. Singh said the gang was operating from Bhopura in the adjoining Ghaziabad district. The gang members had identified themselves as people linked to a bank insurance agency and duped the complainant, who had got a life insurance policy from the HDFC bank six-seven years ago. ""The complainant had paid only one instalment for that policy and not any follow-up instalments. The gang had somehow procured the insurance data and called up the complainant, telling him that ₹26 lakh are in his account, which can be transferred back to him. ""Over a period of time, the gang duped the complainant of ₹1.62 crore in installments of ₹1 lakh or ₹2 lakh in the name of getting him his ₹26 lakh back,"" Singh said. The kingpin of the gang, Sonu Kumar, has been arrested. For this particular case, the accused had appointed his aide Neelesh, who had duped the retired NTPC official, the additional DCP said. ""Sixteen people, including 10 women, have been arrested. All of them had some role to play in the fraud and were aware of what they were doing,"" he said. The gang had opened the fake call centre and using fake sim cards cheated people by assuring them recovery of money in lieu of the policy whose installment had not deposited and other benefits, the police said. An FIR has been lodged at the Noida Sector 113 police station under Indian Penal Code section 420 (cheating) and under provisions of the Information Technology Act against the accused, the police said. The police have recovered 16 mobile phones, one laptop and ₹1.50 lakh cash from the possession of the gang, the police added. Those arrested have been identified as Sonu Kumar, the gang's kingpin, Rohit Kataria, Ashwani Kumar, Rahul Singh, Nilesh Saxena, Ajay Kumar, Sandhya Kumar, Chanchal, Sanjana Bajpayee,, Shruti Kumar, Anjali, Mohini Singh, Kesar Saxena, Chanchal Gupta, Priyanka and Barkha Singh, the police said. Among those arrested, most are residents of Ghaziabad, while some are from Delhi and Faridabad also, the police added. Additional DCP Singh said the gang is understood to have been operating for the last two years but a detailed background check on its activities is underway. The police have also got to know that some gang members had purchased properties with the money duped from various people and details of all such assets and bank accounts are also being checked, he added. The Noida police, meanwhile, urged the general public to be cautious during online activities and during telecommunications especially with unknown callers who talk to people on the pretext of providing them finance-related assistance or benefits.

The electricity giant not only aims to import 20 million tonnes of coal, at an eight-year high, over the next few months but is also targeting 85% growth in its captive coal production this year to 26 million tonne (mt), according to company officials privy to the development. With improved supply of domestic coal and higher imports, NTPC expects to prevent fuel shortages at its plants, which will help the company generate enough power to prevent any demand-supply mismatch for the remaining period of the current fiscal year. NTPC’s installed capacity of 69 GW as of March 2022 accounts for nearly one-fifth of India’s installed capacity and is therefore a key stakeholder in ensuring uninterrupted power supply across the country. “NTPC is a generating company, but it is also playing a key role in providing fuel security for power stations. Our coal imports have already started reaching power stations and entire 20 mt of imports is expected to be completed early this year. Production from our captive mines in difficult operational areas in Jharkhand is also expected to nearly double. Still, we would require adequate supplies of domestic coal for optimal power generation,"" said the official quoted above, seeking anonymity. The union ministry of power has directed all coal-based power plants to import 10% of their requirements to improve the fuel stock at plants amid an unprecedented increase in power demand. NTPC has already imported about 3.8 mt of coal, of which 2.24 mt hass reached power stations, while 1.6 mt has arrived at ports. Orders for the remaining quantity is being given at an accelerated pace so that the fuel is available at power stations in time to meet any shortages.

China’s industrial output and retail sales both contracted more than estimated in April, data showed Monday, and the central bank left the interest rate on one-year policy loans unchanged.

The key highlights of CreditAccess Grameen Ltd.’s (CA Grameen) Q4FY22 performance were a pick-up in GLP growth and improved asset quality. On the operational front, disbursements during the quarter stood at ₹5,792 Cr (+23% YoY and QoQ). Robust disbursement growth translated into a healthy GLP growth of 22% YoY, ahead of management’s guidance of 17-19%. With growth momentum expected to remain healthy, CA Grameen expects GLP to grow at 24-25%, driven by 8-10% customer addition growth. However, as the company looks to implement the new RBI guidelines, disbursement growth in Q1FY23 is likely to be muted.   We believe the asset quality stress is now largely behind and the company is well-positioned to accelerate growth in a risk-calibrated manner.

Delhivery IPO QIB portion was oversubscribed and received a total subscription of 2.66 times.

We have given a neutral rating to delhivery IPO looking at the expensive valuations of the IPO.   Avenue Supermarts Ltd’s stock rose about 7% in opening deals on Monday on the National Stock Exchange, partly reversing losses seen last week when the stock had declined nearly 12%. In fact, shares of the company that runs the DMart chain of retail stores are now off the extremely high levels that they have been enjoying for a while now. After all, the stock has declined as much as 40% from its 52-week high of ₹5,900 apiece seen on 18 October on NSE.   Titan plans to strengthen the core while scaling up its new business. In Jewellery, ICICI Securities said it likes the strategy to open (more) stores in smaller towns. Further, it has clearly carved out its focus on high-growing sub-segments to drive growth.   We maintain BUY Rating on the stock with revised target price of ₹4,654/share at 30x on FY24E EPS. The stock trades at PER of 23.3x on FY24E EPS.   We maintain ‘Buy’ rating on SBI with a revised price target of ₹659: We value the bank at 1.35x FY23 P/BV for an FY23E/24ERoE profile of 14.3/15.8%. We assign a value of ₹181 per share to the subsidiaries, on SOTP.   We maintain our BUY rating on GUJS, with a revised TP of ₹370/sh (from ₹400/sh), as we adjust our estimates to accommodate for a slower trajectory in volume growth and to account for downward revision in tariff. Our SOTP ascribes ₹115/sh to GUJS’s core business, on DCF basis and ₹255/sh to listed and unlisted investments.   Gold today struggled for gains in Indian markets amid flat global rates. On MCX, gold futures slightly higher at near 3-month lows of ₹49,954 per 10 gram while silver moved 0.4% higher at ₹59,565 per kg.   Rating: BUY | CMP: Rs2,433 | TP: Rs2,950 We maintain BUY on Eicher Motors as we anticipate (1) volume growth from Classic 350 plus new product launches and (2) rising exports volume from channel expansion and market share gains to further aid profitability. We trim our EBITDA margin estimates by 100bps for FY23/24 factoring in commodity cost pressures and assign a SoTP based TP of ₹2,950 (at 27x FY24E EPS for standalone business and 17x for VECV).   Volatile market conditions have led to a significant slowdown in the Indian initial public offer (IPO) market during the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2021, EY Global IPO trends report suggests.   Tata Power Company in a regulatory filing said on Monday that its wholly-owned subsidiary Tata Power Solar Systems won an order to build a 300-megawatt solar project for state-owned utility major NHPC at an all-inclusive price of ₹1,731 crore.   Shares of ACC and Ambuja Cements were in huge demand on Monday after Gautam Adani's group clinched a deal to acquire a controlling stake in Holcim Ltd's businesses in India for USD 10.5 billion. The stock of ACC rallied 7.79 per cent to ₹2,288.15 on the BSE. Shares of Ambuja Cements gained 4.13 per cent to ₹373.65. Gautam Adani's group on Sunday said it has clinched a deal to acquire a controlling stake in Holcim Ltd's businesses in India for USD 10.5 billion, marking the ports-to-energy conglomerate's entry into the cement sector.   The base metals pack ended the week on a mixed note, with aluminum being the only metal to gain 1.2 percent for the week. Copper prices rose on Friday after falling to 7-month lows as a slowing global economy will have little to no demand for metals. However, the prices were still on track for their sixth week of losses due to rising fears of a worldwide economic slowdown dampening demand. In the short term, however, metals may stay under pressure, owing to COVID-19 limitations in top customer China, which have slowed metal demand and disrupted supply networks. Another hindrance for base metals was a stronger US dollar, which traded around two-decade highs, lowering demand for dollar-backed commodities. For other currency holders, a stronger dollar raises the cost of acquiring these goods. Outlook: We expect copper to trade lower towards 737 levels, a break of which could prompt the price to move lower to 718 levels.   Bharat Forge (CMP Rs.629) In view of better business visibility, improving economic situation, healthy demand outlook for CV segment and foray into high-margin segments, going forward, we recommend BUY on Bharat Forge with 1-Year TP of Rs1,000, valuing the stock at 30x FY24E. . Intraday Pick DLF (PREVIOUS CLOSE: 319) BUY For today’s trade, long position can be initiated in the range of ₹313- 316 for the target of Rs. 327 with a strict stop loss of ₹310. JUBLFOOD (PREVIOUS CLOSE: 475) BUY For today’s trade, long position can be initiated in the range of ₹466- 471 for the target of Rs. 485 with a strict stop loss of ₹463. TCS (PREVIOUS CLOSE: 3415) BUY For today’s trade, long position can be initiated in the range of ₹3380- 3410 for the target of Rs. 3500 with a strict stop loss of ₹3330.   TechM reported a mixed 4QFY22 performance. Margins were below our expectations while PAT was above our expectation. We expect both telecom and enterprise verticals to witness a healthy growth on the back of step-up in 5G capex and mid-term resiliency in technology demand. We believe TechM will be the key beneficiary of the medium-term themes such as software defined network (SDN) and telecom IT modernization. In view of healthy deal wins, strong deal pipeline and 5G rollout benefiting profitability, we maintain our BUY rating on the stock with a Target Price of Rs1,890, valuing the stock at a P/E multiple of 23x on FY24E earnings.   Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) will list on the stock exchanges tomorrow, following the initial public offer (IPO) which was oversubscribed nearly three times the issue size. The government has fixed the issue price of LIC shares at ₹949 apiece, the upper end of the IPO price band, fetching the exchequer around ₹20,557 crore.   The initial public offer of Venus Pipes and Tubes was subscribed 16.31 times on the last day of subscription on Friday. The issue received bids for 5,79,48,730 shares against 35,51,914 shares on offer. The issue had a price range of ₹310-326 per share.   What investors should know   In view of the strong volume growth ahead, regular price hikes, healthy export potential, structural positives in European operations and comfortable valuation, we turn positive on APTY. Post recent price correction, risk reward is favourable at current valuation of 10.6x FY24E earnings. Therefore, we upgrade APTY to BUY with a revised Target Price of Rs235 (vs. Rs220 earlier).   Millions of Indians investing in the country’s biggest listing could turn sour on the equity market if the stock follows the poor performance of its state-run predecessors. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government raised $2.7 billion by selling shares in Life Insurance Corporation of India, including to millions of families nationwide that hold LIC policies. The stock starts trading Tuesday at a time when markets worldwide are being roiled by the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and rising interest rates. While deep-pocketed global funds can withstand volatility, small investors -- especially first-time shareholders such as the ones created by by LIC’s listing -- risk being burned if the stock underperforms. Of the 21 Indian state-run companies that debuted in the stock market since 2010, half are still trading below their issue price.   India's Adani Group acquired a controlling stake in Holcim AG's cement businesses in India in a $10.5 billion deal to become the second biggest cement producer in the country, Adani Group said in a statement on Sunday. Asia's richest person Gautam Adani's conglomerate acquired 63.19% of Ambuja Cements Ltd and its subsidiary ACC in fierce bidding with local companies. The divestment is the latest move by Holcim as it seeks to reduce its reliance on cement production, an industrial process which produces high levels of carbon emissions and has therefore deterred many environmentally-conscious investors.   Despite the near-term volatility in demand in tractor sales, we expect tractor industry to continue growing going forward on account of the changing industry dynamics, increasing mechanization, rising affordability, and widening alternate usage of tractors. In view of the sizable presence in a relatively better-placed tractor segment, strong positive cash flow, healthy return ratios and attractive valuation, we reiterate our BUY rating on the stock, and maintain the Target Price of Rs2,250.   Rating: BUY | CMP: Rs3,231 | TP: Rs4,651 We cut FY23/24 EPS estimates by 10.8% and 13.5% and DCF based target price to Rs4651 (5345 earlier) even as we upgrade to the stock to Buy post sharp correction. We believe increased capex following accelerated store openings, higher inventory due to inflation and assuming higher WACC (rising interest rates). D’Mart reported strong growth despite higher inflation while growing the share of general merchandise and apparel by 50bps in FY22 vs FY21 (still lower than 27.3% share in FY20). 4Q margin expansion of 15bps shows the robust business model despite deterioration in sales mix and operating cost of 21 new stores opened in 4Q (other expenses up 18.9% YoY and 3.7% QoQ versus just 9.2% increase YoY in 9MFY22).     Gold edged up on Monday from a more than three-month trough hit in the previous session, as lower U.S. Treasury yields kept demand for zero-yield bullion afloat above the key psychological support level of around $1,800 per ounce. Spot gold was up 0.1% at $1,812.15 per ounce, as of 0227 GMT. U.S. gold futures gained 0.1% to $1,809.80.   8 stocks to buy or sell today — 16th May   Bitcoin staged a modest recovery to trade at around $30,000, extending a period of relative market calm after the collapse of a closely watched stablecoin roiled digital assets in the past week. The largest cryptocurrency advanced 3.4% n Sunday to $30,350 as of 4 p.m. in New York. Ether, the second-biggest token, rose 5% while coins like Avalanche and Cardano posted even larger gains. Bitcoin dipped to a low of $25,425 on Thursday after the TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin unraveled, throwing the entire ecoystem that supports it into disarray. At its height, the market panic engulfed the $76 billion stablecoin Tether, a key cog in cryptoassets that briefly dipped from its dollar peg.   Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists cut their forecasts for US growth for this year and next to reflect the shake-out in financial markets amid the Federal Reserve’s tightening of monetary policy. In a report Sunday, the economists led by Jan Hatzius said they now expect the economy to grow 2.4% this year and 1.6% in 2023, down from 2.6% and 2.2% previously.   China’s economy contracted in April, with Covid outbreaks and lockdowns dragging the industrial and consumer sectors down to the weakest levels since early 2020 as millions of residents were confined to their homes and factories were forced to halt production. Industrial output fell 2.9% in April from a year ago, worse than the median estimate of a 0.5% increase in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Retail sales contracted 11.1% in the period, weaker than a projected 6.6% drop. The unemployment rate climbed to 6.1%, higher than the forecast of 6%. China’s economy has taken an enormous toll from the government’s stringent efforts to keep the virus at bay. Beijing has insisted on sticking with its Covid Zero strategy to curb infections, even though the high transmissibility of omicron puts cities at greater risk of repeatedly locking down and reopening compared to earlier strains.   China’s central bank refrained from cutting interest rates despite mounting evidence of a sharp slowdown in economic growth, suggesting policy makers may be concerned about the currency’s depreciation and capital outflows. The People’s Bank of China kept the rate on its one-year medium-term lending facility at 2.85% on Monday. Economists had been split on the decision, with 13 of the 25 surveyed by Bloomberg expecting no change, and the rest predicting a reduction between 5 basis points and 15 basis points. The PBOC also rolled over the maturing 100 billion yuan ($15 billion) of medium-term lending facility loans without providing additional liquidity.   The dollar was firm Monday while equity futures pointed to the possibility of stock market gains in Asia following a bounce in US shares. Contracts rose for Japan, Australia and Hong Kong after a technology-led jump on Wall Street Friday in a tumultuous week in markets. The risk of an economic downturn amid high inflation and rising borrowing costs is the major worry for markets, alongside Russia’s war in Ukraine and China’s growth-sapping Covid lockdowns.   As spiraling inflation spreads across the globe, emerging-market bonds from Turkey to Thailand are feeling the brunt. Local-currency debt from developing nations -- which is far more sensitive to a country’s domestic inflationary pressures than dollar denominated equivalents -- has slumped almost 9% this year, the most since at least 2008, according to a Bloomberg index. There’s unlikely to be any relief soon as central bankers around the world attempt to control surging prices by raising interest rates even more aggressively -- potentially risking growth in doing so.   Wheat jumped by the exchange limit after India’s move to restrict exports, exposing just how tight global supplies are after the war in Ukraine and threatening to drive up food prices even more. The government will suspend overseas sales to manage its food security, according to a notification dated May 13. This drew criticism from the agriculture ministers of the Group of Seven nations, who said that such measures make the world’s crisis worse. Benchmark futures rose as much as 5.9% to $12.47 1/2 a bushel in Chicago, the highest in two months. Prices have surged about 60% this year, increasing the cost of everything from bread to cakes and noodles. The surprising thing is that India isn’t even a prominent exporter on the world stage. The fact that it could have such a major impact underscores the bleak prospect for global wheat supplies. War has crippled Ukraine’s exports, and now droughts, floods and heat waves threaten crops in most major producers.   Oil fluctuated at the start of a new week as investors weighed plans by Germany to ban Russian crude imports, while US gasoline futures rallied to top $4 a gallon for the first time ever. West Texas Intermediate crude swung between gains and losses near $111 a barrel after posting a third weekly gain. Germany plans to stop importing Russian imports by the end of the year even if the European Union fails to agree on co-ordinated action, according to government officials. The market has been gripped by a tumultuous period of trading since Russia’s late-February invasion of Ukraine and a Covid-19 resurgence in China. The war has boosted the cost of food and fuels, with surging US retail gasoline and diesel prices helping fan the fastest inflation in decades.   Stocks in Asia climbed with US equity futures Monday amid a steadier mood in global markets following a Wall Street bounce. Equities rose in Japan, Australia and South Korea, while Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 contracts pushed higher, signaling some relief from this year’s stock market rout. A gauge of the dollar was little changed. Sentiment may be getting a boost from the People’s Bank of China, which effectively cut the interest rate for new mortgages over the weekend, seeking to bolster an ailing housing market. Meanwhile, Shanghai partially loosened its Covid lockdown by announcing a phased reopening of shops. Virus curbs are squeezing China’s economy and some analysts expect a cut in the rate on one-year policy loans Monday. In the bond market, a key question is whether economic worries will help stem 2022’s Treasury selloff, which has been driven by inflation and tightening US monetary settings. The 10-year US yield increased to 2.94%.   Tokyo shares opened higher on Monday after Wall Street rebounded, backed by gains among high-tech stocks. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index gained 1.23 percent, or 325.72 points, to 26,753.37 at the open, while the broader Topix index rose 1.03 percent, or 19.13 points, to 1,883.33. Wall Street stocks rallied on Friday, finally managing to score gains at the end of a week beset by worries over inflation, the Ukraine war and the global economic outlook. The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index led the major US indices, jumping 3.8 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.5 percent, while the broad-based S&P 500 rose 2.4 percent. ""The Dow rebounded for the first time (after a six-day losing streak) and Nasdaq continued to grow significantly. This will be a tailwind for Japanese stocks,"" Okasan Online Securities said.  "

Updated: 04 May 2022,India turns to coal again despite climate woes,https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/india-returns-to-coal-despite-climate-woes-11651604111580.html,"NEW DELHI : India plans to expand its coal-fuelled power generation capacity after a six-year gap as a spike in demand caused by scorching summer temperatures triggered blackouts in some parts of the nation. State-run NTPC Ltd, the country’s largest power producer, invited bids to construct one such plant to meet the growing electricity demand, a top company executive said.            "
Updated: 03 May 2022,"NTPC to award contract to construct 1,320 MW coal-fired plant ",https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/ntpc-to-award-contract-to-construct-1-320-mw-coal-fired-plant-11651566957904.html,"After a long gap, India plans to build new coal-fuelled power generation capacity with the country’s largest electricity generator NTPC Ltd all set to call bids for three such plants to meet the growing demand for electricity. According to a company official aware of the plan, NTPC will this month award a contract to construct a 1,320-megawatt coal-fired supercritical plant in Talcher, Odisha. This is the first time in six years NTPC will be calling for bids for new coal-fired capacity after the generator decided to set up only greenfield renewable capacities to take up its fossil fuel and renewable generation mix to 50:50 by 2032 from the present share of fossil fuel of about 80%. The focus on coal-fired plants is also in the wake of the country’s worsening power crisis and the inability of fossil fuel-based plants to maintain grid stability and frequency amid wide-scale mismatch in demand and supply. The company will also consider awarding contracts for two previously stalled expansion projects at its Lara and Singrauli sites in central India, the official said, requesting anonymity as the plans are still being discussed. NTPC didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment. The country is grappling with a power crisis as unusually hot summer in early months shored up power demand while fuel supplies to power stations remained sluggish, leaving several stations with critically low coal stocks. The demand-supply mismatch resulted in several parts of the country plunging into darkness with state utilities resorting to power cuts of up to 8 hours a day in several areas. Though the marginal dip in temperatures in north India has reduced power demand for now, the long summer ahead may trigger a crisis situation again. “NTPC’s decision to revive plants to put up its announced coal-fired stations is a good development as coal will continue to be the mainstay of the country’s power system for a long time and it makes sense to fully utilise this potential before relying on other fuel mixes,"" said a power analyst from one of the four big audit and consultancy firms asking not to be named. In Talcher, NTPC proposes to award 1,320 MW of capacity with two supercritical units of 660 MW each. In Talcher, NTPC was operating one of its oldest plants, a 460 MW unit that was shut last year in March after 54 years. At Lara in Chhattisgarh, NTPC planned 4,000 MW coal capacity with an investment of over ₹20,000 crore but is operating just 1600 MW. So, it may look at adding three more units of 800 MW here. In Singrauli, Uttar Pradesh, the company would replace its existing 2,000 MW capacity with a new plant with capacity configuration still being worked out. The official said, as these project sites are not best suited for renewable capacities, NTPC would look at coal fired capacities. NTPC had also previously slowed plans to advance the Lara and Singrauli projects as electricity demand faltered during the pandemic. With power demand rising in the country as economy picks up pace post the pandemic, NTPC is also looking to increase coal imports to 20 million tonne during the current fiscal, and raise output from its captive mines by a whopping 86% this year to 26 million tonne."

New Delhi-based NTPC will this month award a contract to construct a 1,320-megawatt plant in Odisha, according to a company official with knowledge of the plans.  The company will also consider awarding contracts for two previously stalled expansion projects at its Lara and Singrauli sites in central India, the official said, requesting anonymity as the plans are still private.  NTPC didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment Tuesday, which is a public holiday in India. Several states across India are suffering prolonged blackouts as scorching heat waves boost energy demand at a time when coal stockpiles are dwindling and nations globally are contending with tight fuel markets. Disruptions to electricity supply are lasting as long as eight hours a day in some areas. NTPC previously slowed plans to advance the Lara and Singrauli projects as electricity demand faltered during the pandemic. The producer has also been focusing on proposals to increase renewable energy capacity, rather than coal. Despite a near-term addition to its coal fleet, the company will stick to a target to rapidly expand clean power capacity, the official said. NTPC is aiming to cut the share of fossil fuels in its energy mix to about half by 2032 from 83% currently. NTPC’s plans for the Odisha plant show how India, which still relies on coal for about 70% of electricity generation, can use the fossil fuel more efficiently, according to R. Srikanth, a professor of energy and climate at National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bengaluru.  “One way to do that is phase out all old power plants and replace them with modern plants that consume less coal to produce the same amount of energy,"" Srikanth said. “We need to stop defaming coal.""  NTPC’s new facility will replace a smaller plant at the same site that was phased out last year after more than five decades.  The producer is also taking steps to address the coal shortages that are prompting India energy crunch. Imports will be increased to 20 million tons during the fiscal year to March, while NTPC will aim to boost annual output at its own mines by about 86% to 26 million tons.

NTPC said that Dadri-II, and Unchahar power plants are operating at maximum capacity, adding that present stock level is at 1,40,000 tonne and 95,000 tonne respectively. Import coal supplies are also in the pipeline, it added. The Delhi government had said that two important power sources are facing a coal supply shortage which could result in disruption in power supply to essential institutions such as the Delhi Metro and the hospitals. The national capital gets the maximum supply of 728 MW from Dadri-II power station and 100 MW from Unchahar power station, the Arvind Kejriwal government said while flagging disruption of power supply from these two power stations. The Delhi government appealed to the Centre to take immediate steps so as to ensure undisrupted power supply in the capital as there is a shortage of coal in various thermal stations in Delhi, according to a statement from the state government on Thursday. “If steps are not taken in time, there may be problems with round the clock power supply in Delhi Metro and hospitals,"" said the statement. The coal supply situation in power plants has become a pain point for states and the Centre even as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday forecast temperature to touch 46 degree Celsius mark in parts of Delhi. IMD has issued heatwave warnings for three days upto 1 May for western Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Western Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. “Today’s temperature in Delhi may rise by 0.5-1 degrees and touch 46°C at some stations. Some stations in Haryana may record temperatures over 46°C. Peak temperature today will be in Haryana, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Western Uttar Pradesh,"" news agency ANI reported quoting RK Jenamani, senior scientist, at the India Meteorological Department. From 2 May, a change is taking place, a western disturbance is advancing and thunder and rain are likely, the agency said in its Twitter handle quoting Jenamani. The Delhi government had claimed that barely a day’s worth of coal stock was left in Dadri-II power plant which is the main source of power for the national capital. It supplies 728 megawatt (MW) power to the state. Delhi government also said the supply of coal will last between one to eight days in different plants supplying power to the state. State-owned power producer NTPC Ltd. said in a tweet on Friday that currently Unchahar and Dadri power stations are declaring more than 100% rated capacity to the grid. “All six units of Dadri and five units of Unchahar are running at full capacity and receiving regular coal supplies.

Updated: 27 Apr 2022,Power crisis adds to heat wave woes in east India,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/power-crisis-adds-to-heat-wave-woes-in-east-india-11651065822864.html,"KOLKATA : As no respite is in view from the sweltering heatwave in eastern India, the region has seen a rising demand in electricity, simultaneously a rise in power outages.  Jharkhand, Odisha and Bihar has reported power outages in the past few days from their major cities as well as rural areas.   Several reports of coal shortage have emerged in the past few weeks adding to the woes of people and their ruling governments.  Maximum temperatures in most places in these states are hovering above 40 degrees Celsius with little respite on offer over the the next few days, the weatherman said. Situation in Jharkhand Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren admitted that the state is unable to meet the peak demand, but said his government has sanctioned additional funds for buying power from the open market through energy exchanges. ""The heat is beyond imagination... several states in the country are facing shortage of power. It is also difficult to purchase power from the open market due to high rates and competition among states,"" Soren said. As per the Central Electricity Authority, the state has a total installed capacity of 4,556.44 MW as on January. Of this, around 4,250 MW comes from thermal sources. Thermal power plants in Jharkhand are reportedly unable to fulfil the daily peak hour requirement of nearly 2,400 MW in the wake of ""lower"" supply of coal, the officials said. Situation in Odisha In Odisha, residents of a number of districts complained of frequent power cuts amid scorching heat. The state faced acute shortage of electricity in mid-April following the breakdown of an NTPC unit, which generates 800 MW of power, of which Odisha's share is 400 MW. The energy department has also called for regulating air-conditioner load, industrial and agricultural load during peak hours from 7 pm to 11 pm for the next one week in order to maintain stable power supply. The coal crisis at certain independent power plants (IPPs) has also added to the electricity woes in the state, an official of the department said. ""The government is dealing with a situation in April, which was expected in May. Never before has Odisha experienced such high temperatures in April,"" said Energy Secretary N B Dhal. Odisha's current peak power demand is estimated to be 5,200- 5,400 MW, while the state generates around 4,800 MW. ""Discussions in a meeting (chaired by Chief Secretary S C Mohapatra) indicated that the power supply situation is quite under control, and it would get better by the first week of May,"" an official release said. Situation in Bihar Bihar Energy Secretary Sanjeev Hans said the state is facing a power deficit of 200-300 MW per day because of the sudden increase in demand, following the early arrival of peak summer and reduced generation of hydropower. The state’s consumption is close to 6,000 MW per day and availability from different sources is to the tune of 5,000-5,200 MW, he said. ""However, almost every day we are purchasing around 600 MW from the power exchange at higher rates,"" Hans told news agency PTI. State-owned National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) has an installed power generation capacity of 8,410 MW across six projects in Bihar. ""In terms of meeting power demand, Bihar is in a much better position if you compare figures with other states,"" said Vishwanath Chandan, spokesperson, NTPC (Eastern Region-1). Situation in West Bengal Meanwhile, officials in West Bengal said the state is a major power producer and capable of managing its electricity demand. ""We are operating all our generation units at around 85 per cent plant load factor as per norms, and we have been able to exponentially increase our coal production from captive mines,"" West Bengal Power Development Corporation Ltd (WBPDCL) Chairman and Managing Director P B Salim told PTI. The state-run power producer has six thermal plants in West Bengal. Average power demand in the state is between 9,000 MW and 9,200 MW, the officials said. "

Updated: 22 Apr 2022,Maharashtra govt to import coal to tide over load shedding crisis: Ajit Pawar,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/maharashtra-govt-to-import-coal-to-tide-over-load-shedding-crisis-ajit-pawar-11650619529447.html,"Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said that in order to tide over the current load shedding crisis in the state, the government has decided to import coal to some extent from outside the country for power generation. The scale of the purchases and the decision to go back on a plan to cut coal imports underscore the severity of the India's fuel crisis. Utilities' coal inventories are at the lowest pre-summer levels in at least nine years and electricity demand is seen rising at the fastest pace in at least 38 years. Maharashtra plans to import 8 million tonnes for ""blending purposes,"" while Gujarat will place orders for 1 million tonnes next week, news agency Reuters reported. Pawar also said that efforts were on to get one coal mine in Chhattisgarh allocated to the power department in Maharashtra. Speaking to reporters here, Pawar said the supply of coal was not being done in the country the way it should be. ""Load shedding is going on in the state. A meeting was held on this issue by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. I will take a review of the power department every week on the issue of load shedding and the cabinet has given its approval to check whether there is any availability of power in the country,"" he said. Efforts are being made to do away with load shedding and to ensure smooth power supply in the state, the senior NCP leader said. ""Coal supply to several states is insufficient. Maharashtra is also not getting enough supply and that is why we have taken a decision to import coal to some extent from outside the country. Besides that, efforts are being made to get one coal mine allocated for Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited (Mahagenco)...Energy Minister Nitin Raut is working on it,"" Pawar added. Congress president Sonia Gandhi has also asked the Chattishgarh government which is of a similar ideology, to allocate one coal mine to Maharashtra, he said. Replying to a question whether the BJP-led Centre was indulging in vendetta politics by not providing coal to Maharashtra, Pawar said the supply of coal to various states was not happening the way it should be done. ""There are issues of railway wagons. Today, railway wagons are needed to transport coal, sugar, wheat and other essential commodities, which need to be taken to the ports. I do not want to bring any politics into it. I do not want to make that kind of allegation, but it is a fact that there is a shortage of coal,"" the deputy chief minister said. Last week, minister Nitin Raut had said that load shedding in the state was a result of increase in electricity demand relaxation of the Covid-19 curbs, and blamed the Centre for poor management of coal supply. Coal miners in South Africa, Australia and Indonesia are likely to be the main beneficiaries of India's buying spree, though those producers are already stretched by the recent spike in demand. India's federal government has also asked the state governments of Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana to import a total of 10 million tonnes of coal. While Punjab has committed to import 625,000 tonnes, the other states have not detailed any plans, the meeting minutes showed. Maharashtra's expected 8 million tonnes of coal imports will be in addition to the 2 million tonnes it had already ordered, for which delivery is expected on May 8. India had previously asked state government-run utilities to import 4% of their coal requirements for blending, but subsequently suggested last week that imports be boosted to 10% of the quantity needed to address soaring power demand. Federal government-run NTPC Ltd, the country's top electricity producer, plans to boost coal imports to the highest level in eight years, Reuters reported last month. Many Indian states including Andhra Pradesh in the south, Maharashtra in the west and Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan in the north are already facing power cuts. (With inputs from agencies)"

Eventually, the stock closed 6% higher, taking the returns so far this calendar year to about 31%. In comparison, the Nifty50 index has declined by 1% year-to-date. One reason for the optimism on the NTPC stock is that the Street hopes the company will fetch higher valuations for its renewable energy assets.         "
Updated: 18 Apr 2022,"With demand soaring, NTPC on strong footing",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/with-demand-soaring-ntpc-on-strong-footing-11650272422262.html,"Shares of NTPC Ltd hit a new 52-week of ₹163.15 apiece on Monday on the NSE. So far this calendar year, the stock has surged by around 31%. One reason for the optimism on the NTPC stock is that the Street hopes that the company will be able to fetch higher valuations for its renewable energy assets.  “Further, the steep pre-money equity valuation of Rs34000 crore which Tata Power Co.’s renewable platform was able to garner sets a new benchmark for the industry. A potential deal at high valuations cannot be ruled out for NTPC’s renewable assets as well,"" said Rohit Natarajan, analyst at Antique Stock Broking Ltd. In general, NTPC is a beneficiary of strong power demand in the country. Also, the company’s captive mines and coal linkages place it in a relatively better position as the tariffs are much lower when compared to the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) prices. Amid increased demand and coal shortage, the average market clearing price (MCP) in the day-ahead electricity market on the IEX, touched ₹8.9 per unit in April (average till 18 April). This is a further increase from the average MCP seen in March. In FY22, prices have averaged at Rs4.4 per unit. On the other hand, NTPC’s average tariff in the nine-month ended FY22 (9MFY22), stood at 3.91 per unit. “We believe since the exchange is not proving to be a reliable means for catering to discoms’ (distributor companies) power requirements, due to the huge gap in purchase and sell bids leading to extraordinary prices, discoms will be drawing more (purchase power agreement) PPA-based thermal power going forward, benefitting NTPC,"" said analysts at ICICI Securities in a report on 12 April. Moving ahead, NTPC is transitioning into an integrated power generating company with an increasing focus on clean and green energy. In FY22, the non-fossil fuel share in total installed capacity rose by 30 basis points to 8.1%, according to ICICI Securities. One basis point is 0.01%. NTPC aims to enhance its renewable portfolio and install 60GW (gigawatt) of renewable energy capacity by 2032. But for now, thermal power is seeing increased traction as power generated from renewable sources is not available round the clock as they have natural limitations. As such, NTPC would stand to benefit as coal-based plants form the largest portion of its total installed capacity. In FY22, the plant load factor of coal-based plants reached 70.7%, and is expected to increase further as necessity rises. “With uptick in demand, NTPC has enough capacity to respond to the same,"" said Abhineet Anand, analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. However, there are offsetting factors. “Key downside risk in the medium term includes a severe coal shortage which would result in under-utilization of NTPC’s capacities. Though the company has captive mines, the potential ramp-up in coal supplies from Coal India Ltd needs to be closely monitored,"" added Anand."

The state-run utility, which produces over a quarter of India's power output, will import 16 million tonnes for blending with domestic coal during the year ending March 2023, the NTPC officials said. ""We have been directed by the Indian government to import 16 million tonnes, and we will be doing it to ensure the country's energy security,"" one of the officials said. The rise in imports reflects strong growth in demand for power as India's economy recovers after the pandemic and forecasts for a particularly hot summer. India's federal government has directed all utilities to cumulatively import about 33.5 million tonnes for blending during the year, the second official said, the highest in at least six years. Higher imports by India could put further upward pressure on global coal prices, which touched record highs in March in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia - Europe's biggest supplier. Prices have cooled since, but are still much higher than average levels in 2021. India is the world's second coal importer, and counts Indonesia, Australia and South Africa as its major suppliers. Details on India's coal import plans have not been previously reported. India's power generation surged at its fastest pace in three months in March, due to higher than normal temperatures for the month and increased activity following the relaxation of COVID restrictions, while power cuts hit the highest level since October. State government-run utilities have been asked to import 8.75 million tonnes this financial year, private utility operators have been directed to buy 6.22 million tonnes while other federal government-run utilities will import 2.53 million tonnes for blending, the second official said. NTPC has already awarded contracts to procure nearly 7 million tonnes, the officials said, adding all of it has been sourced from Indonesia at slight premiums to benchmark prices. NTPC did not immediately respond to a request seeking official comment. SURGING POWER DEMAND Higher power demand has forced India to cut coal supplies to the non-power sector, and mothball plans for some fuel auctions, despite record production and supply by state-run Coal India Ltd, which produces over 80% of India's coal. Some of India's non-power sector consumers, who largely use power generated from utilities not connected to the national grid, are also drawing expensive power from the national grid, adding to pressure on utilities with low coal stock. The higher imports reflect the magnitude of India's coal shortage heading into the summer, when power demand typically peaks due to increased air-conditioning demand and heightened industrial activity. ""We have done everything. Domestic coal production has risen. The whole crisis is because of the closure of imported coal-based power plants and gas-fired plants,"" the first official said. Nine of the country's 23 imported coal-based power plants are shut and most of the gas-fired power plants are either not operating or at a lower capacity, government data showed, as industry officials say high global fuel prices have made these plants too expensive to run at full capacity.

Updated: 04 Apr 2022,Andhra Pradesh cancels Adani bids to supply imported coal,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/andhra-pradesh-cancels-adani-bids-to-supply-imported-coal-11649029575585.html,"NEW DELHI : India's southern Andhra Pradesh has cancelled bids made for two separate tenders by India's Adani Enterprises to supply imported coal as the prices quoted were too high, two state government officials told Reuters. It is the first time in recent years that a major government tender for imported coal has been cancelled over high prices. Details on the cancellation have not been previously reported. India has asked utilities to step up coal imports to address a domestic shortfall. However, expensive imports could add to the financial woes of state government-owned, debt-laden power distributors, which have overdue payments of nearly $15 billion to power generators. Adani, India's largest coal trader, offered to supply last month 500,000 tonnes of South African coal at 40,000 rupees ($526.50) per tonne and another 750,000 tonnes at 17,480 rupees ($230.08) in January, the officials said. Benchmark South African coal prices started rising in January to hit a monthly high of $176.50 per tonne in the wake of an export ban by Indonesia, extending the rise to a record $441.65 per tonne in March due to the Russia-Ukraine war. Both tenders were cancelled because the prices quoted were too high, the officials said. Adani was the only bidder for the 500,000 tonnes tender, while Agarwal Coal, which had also bid for the 750,000 tonnes tender, had quoted a higher price than Adani, they said. Adani and Agarwal Coal did not immediately respond to emails and calls seeking comment on Sunday. India has cut supplies to the non-power sector as it faced two of its worst power shortages in recent years in October and March, despite record production by state-run near-monopoly Coal India Ltd. One of the officials, B Sreedhar, managing director at Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corp Ltd, said the current power shortage was not as bad as the one in October, but said the state was living a ""hand-to-mouth existence"". ""We have not been able to build up stocks. Even though coal is available locally because of more mining, transportation is an issue,"" Sreedhar told Reuters. Andhra Pradesh, which faced an electricity deficit of 7% during the last three days of March, floated a tender this week ""for urgent procurement"" of 100,000 tonnes of imported coal, the officials said. Indian state government-owned utilities could import at least 2.6 million tonnes in the coming months to address summer power demand, equalling total buying in the last 24 months, other state government officials said. The western Maharashtra state has floated a tender to procure 2 million tonnes of coal, while southern Tamil Nadu state could float tenders to procure 480,000 tonnes, senior officials there said. Federal government-run NTPC Ltd floated a tender last month to import 1.25 million tonnes of coal."
Updated: 02 Apr 2022,"Diversion of power only on request of states, DERC has no jurisdiction: Centre",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/diversion-of-power-only-on-request-of-states-derc-has-no-jurisdiction-centre-11648911440984.html,"Power from the central generating stations (CGS) will be allotted by the Central government to the states on their request, the ministry of power said on Saturday. The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has no jurisdiction in the matter, it said. The Delhi government and the city's power regulator DERC on Wednesday wrote to the Centre asking it to ensure adequate electricity supply to save the national capital from blackouts during the summer season. The power ministry had issued instructions to the Northern Regional Power Committee (NRPC) to re-allocate Delhi's share of 728 MW from the NTPC Dadri-II plant to Haryana from 1 April. However, in an urgent hearing earlier in the day, the Delhi High Court stayed the implementation of the power ministry's order, which was issued on Monday, they said, adding that the next date of hearing in the matter is April 1. The secretary of the DERC in a letter to the ministry's secretary requested it to ""immediately withdraw"" the reallocation order to avoid blackout in certain parts of the national capital and to meet continuous supply of power to run essential services like the Delhi Metro rail and hospitals. The ministry of power, in a statement issued today, said if any reallocation is to be done, it is only on the request of the state government and that also in case any other state is willing to take the surrendered power. ""The DERC jurisdiction extends only to fixation of tariff and giving advice and direction to Discoms of their State. The DERC can not give any direction to the central or the state governments,"" it added. In case of NTPC Dadri-II Thermal Power Plant, the central government said it had made allocation of this power to Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. ""Delhi power minister Satyendar Jain via his letter had surrendered power from 11 central generating stations which also include Dadri stage-II thermal power plant of NTPC, with immediate effect and to reallocate the same to other needy states. As per the said letter Delhi had surrendered full 735 MW allocation permanently,"" it said. ""Thereafter, government of India wrote to all states, that this power which has been surrendered by Delhi is available for reallocation. The government of Delhi did not protest or withdraw their letter of surrender. The reallocation of power surrendered by Delhiwas done to other states as and when other states requested for it."" Centre said Delhi government did not protest against these reallocation at any time. ""The balance power from Dadri stage-II to an extent of 728 MW was available for reallocation and, accordingly, on 28 March, 2022, the same has been given to Haryana based on their request. No request for withdrawal of the surrendered share had been received from Government of Delhi to the Government of India till 28.03.2022. It was only after reallocation of this power on 28 March, that the Government of NCT of Delhi woke up on 30 March and wrote to MoP to restore the Delhi share from Dadri stage II. Government of NCT of Delhi has quoted a letter from DERC dated 6th January, 2022 which was written to NTPC and a letter of DERC dated 14th October, 2021,"" the Centre said ""However, as pointed above DERC has no jurisdiction in the matter of allocation of power from central generating stations,"" it added ""It may also be noted that Delhi have relinquished their share of 756 MW from Dadri-I indicating that this power is surplus. Thus, if Delhi is really under crisis and have concern about their consumers, they should not have surrendered their share from Dadri-I. As the reallocation to Haryana has already happened on 28 March, any further reallocation can only be after hearing Haryana as Haryana is now also an affected party and any withdrawal would impact their power adequacy plans."" News agency PTI reported that said that the reallocation of power from Delhi to Haryana caught electricity distribution companies (discoms) unaware. The city's discoms have already surrendered power allocation from the Dadri-I plant, citing high cost, from November 2020. ""The reallocation of power to Delhi from Dadri-II is also beyond comprehension as the power purchase agreement of discoms for scheduling power from Dadri-II is valid and in force till July 30, 2035, when it completes stipulated 25 years,"" the PTI report said. The reallocation from the Dadri-II plant will pose a big problem before the discoms as such a large quantum of power (728 MW) at short notice may not be easily available at the power exchange, where the rates are already fluctuating between ₹10-15 per unit, the officials said."
