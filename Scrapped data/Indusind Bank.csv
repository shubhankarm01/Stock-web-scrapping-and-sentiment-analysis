Updated: 25 Jun 2022,Why are attractive FD interest rates vital in high inflation scenario,https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/why-are-attractive-fd-interest-rates-vital-in-high-inflation-scenario-11656079356689.html,"The real rate of return for the depositors amidst multi-year high inflation is of utmost importance as their investments are important for banks functioning. If the interest rate is artificially low then the inflation rate that could lead to negative returns and would nudge depositors to opt for assets like gold as a mode of investment, the RBI governor Shaktikanta Das explains. Depositors turning to assets like gold could impact financial savings and further impact investment. In an interview with the Times of India newspaper, the RBI governor said, ""When the central bank communicates that it is focused on inflation and takes steps in that direction, it gives confidence and a clear message to households and businesses."" Further, Das said this will anchor inflation expectations and contain second-round effects of supply shocks. Eventually, the core and headline inflation can moderate. However, Das also said, ""let us not forget the depositors with whose savings the banks function."" According to the RBI governor, in an environment of high inflation, if interest rates are kept artificially low, then the real rate of return for the depositors would become that much more negative and if that happens, depositors may turn to other assets like gold. ""This will impact financial savings and have an immediate impact on investment,"" Das added. Any change in RBI's policy repo rate will have an impact on the lending and deposit rates of the bank. However, the quantum and timing of passing on the policy repo changes depend upon the bank. In a rate hike scenario, the interest rates on term loans such as houses, cars, and personal among others - are seen to get higher. However, such is the opposite for deposits as they seem to become attractive - giving hefty returns to depositors on their investments in traditional schemes, especially in fixed deposits which are less risker than compared to market instruments and also offer guaranteed returns. In the last two monetary policies, RBI has hiked the repo rate by 90 basis points. In May, RBI raised the rate by 40 basis points and further increased it to 50 basis points in June 2022 policy. Now, the policy repo rate stands at 4.9%. RBI forecasts an inflation rate of 6.7% for the financial year FY23. RBI's medium-term target for inflation is 4% with a band of +/- 2% while supporting growth. Inflation continues to stay above RBI's comfort zone for the fifth consecutive month. In May, the consumer price index stood at 7.04%, although, it moderated from the 95-month high of 7.79% witnessed in April this year. Bank deposits and lending rates have gone up as well. These three banks offer inflation-beating interest rates to senior citizens. RBL Bank: On FDs below ₹2 crore, RBL Bank offers a 7.15% interest rate to senior citizens on 15 months tenure. RBL Bank also offers a 7% interest rate to senior citizens on 24 months to less than 36 months tenure. For senior citizens, the bank offers an interest rate of 6.80% on tenures like 36 months to less than 60 months; 60 months to 60 months 1 day; and Tax Savings Fixed Deposit (60 months). Meanwhile, the bank gives a 6.75% rate on maturity period of 12 months to less than 15 months; and from 15 months 1 day to less than 24 months. Further, the rate is 6.25% on tenures from 60 months 2 days to 240 months. The rate is 3.75% to 5.75% on tenures from 7 days to 364 days. AU Small Finance Bank: With effect from June 24, AU Small Finance Bank gives a 7.10% rate to senior citizens on tenures of 12 Months 1 Day to 15 Months. It also offers an interest rate of 7.40% each on tenures - 24 Months 1 Day to 36 Months; 36 Months 1 Day to 45 Months; and 60 Months to 120 Months. Meanwhile, the bank offers a 6.95% rate on tenures like 15 Months 1 Day to 18 Months; 18 Months 1 Day to 24 Months; and 45 Months 1 Day to less than 60 Months. While the interest rate ranges from 4.25% to 5.85% on tenures starting 7 days to 12 months. The interest rate is applicable on FDs below ₹2 crore. IndusInd Bank: Although, IndusInd Bank does not offer above the inflation rate of 7.04%. However, it gives the maximum rate of 7% which is near the inflation rate, to senior citizens on deposits less than ₹2 crore on tenures starting 2 years to below 61 months. The private bank also gives a 7% rate on the Indus Tax Saver scheme for 5 years to senior citizens. Further, the bank offers 6.75% on tenures 1 Year 6 Months to below 2 years; while the rate is 6.50% each on 1 Year to below 1 Year 6 Months; and 61 months and above. To senior citizens, the bank offers an interest rate from 3.75% to 6% on tenures starting 7 days to 364 days. IndusInd's interest rate is still higher than peers like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, and Kotak Bank."

Shares were higher in Europe and Asia on Friday despite data suggesting some economies are slowing. Shares rose in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and South Korea.  Indian indices on Friday closed higher, led by good buying support in telecom, financial and auto stocks. The Sensex gained 462.26 points, or 0.88%, to close at 52,727.98, while Nifty50 added 142.60 points to end at 15,699.25. Sectorally, telecom, bank, auto, and financial stocks performed well, while IT stocks dragged.

On the Nifty50 index, M&M, Hero MotoCorp, and IndusInd Bank registered the biggest gains, while TechM, Infosys, and Apollo Hospitals were the biggest laggards.   The US dollar slipped on Friday and headed for its first weekly decline of June as traders dialled down bets on where interest rates might peak and brought forward the timing of rate cuts to counter a possible recession. A significant shift this week has been the fall in oil and commodity prices, which has eased inflation fears and allowed equity markets to rebound. This has eroded the safe-haven bid that's been boosting the greenback against major currencies.   Crude oil futures on Friday declined by 0.54 per cent to ₹8,178 per barrel as participants trimmed their positions on low demand. On the Multi Commodity Exchange, crude oil for July delivery fell by ₹44 or 0.54 per cent to ₹8,178 per barrel with a business volume of 3,881 lots. Globally, West Texas Intermediate crude oil was trading 0.09 per cent lower at USD 104.36 per barrel and Brent crude was 0.04 per cent down at USD 110.09 per barrel in New York.   Gold prices on Friday fell by ₹46 to ₹50,548 per 10 grams in futures trade as speculators reduced their positions. On the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold contracts for August delivery traded lower by ₹46 or 0.09 per cent at ₹50,548 per 10 grams in a business turnover of 12,159 lots.

Cottonseed oil cake prices on Friday declined by ₹3 to ₹2,597 per quintal in futures trade as participants reduced their bets tracking a weak trend in spot market. On the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange, cottonseed oil cake for July delivery fell by ₹3 or 0.12 per cent to ₹2,597 per quintal with an open interest of 78,700 lots. Analysts said sell-off by participants at existing levels amid subdued trend in market mainly weighed on cottonseed oil cake prices.   Copper futures on Friday fell by ₹4.85 to ₹693.40 per kilogram as participants cut their positions amid muted demand in domestic market. On the Multi Commodity Exchange, copper contracts for July delivery eased by ₹4.85 or 0.69 per cent to ₹693.40 per kg in a business turnover of 5,507 lots. Analysts said trimming of positions by speculators amid muted demand in spot market mainly dragged down copper prices in the futures trade.   Shares were higher in Europe and Asia on Friday despite data suggesting some economies are slowing. U.S. futures also advanced after a rally Thursday on Wall Street, where the market is headed for its first weekly gain after three weeks of punishing losses. Market players are looking ahead to U.S. inflation data due next week and hoping that the moderation in prices of oil and some other commodities this week is a sign inflation might be abating.   Rating: BUY | CMP: Rs354 | TP: Rs435 LIC Housing Finance (LICHF) saw a good quarter with a positive surprise on PAT led by beat on all fronts barring loan growth, that was a miss as volumes were impacted due to third covid wave. The company guided that disbursals could grow by 15% in FY23 and builder loans could see an uptick that might contribute 5-10% to credit flow. NII was ahead due to higher NIM driven by lower funding cost. Benefit of borrowing cost could continue, that might cushion NIM considering that fixed rate liabilities contribute 53% and interest rates could harden. Asset quality improved with GNPA/NNPA reducing QoQ by 40bps each led by better recoveries. LICHF performed well in H2FY22 while valuation at 0.8x is attractive. We maintain multiple at 1.0x FY24 ABV but slightly raise TP to Rs435. Upgrade from ACCUMULATE to BUY.   Global equity investors may be excited to see green on their screens this week but stock gains seem to be a function of a stronger shift toward defensives rather than a full-throated risk-on roar. A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. index of defensive stocks including megacap tech and healthcare names has climbed to more than an 18-month high relative to the MSCI AC World Index, as fears of a global recession outweigh concern over sky-high inflation. The gauge has jumped over 4% this week, double the rise in the global stocks benchmark -- itself on track for its first weekly gain in four. Investors are beginning to consider the consequences of a Federal Reserve that seems willing to hike the world’s largest economy into recession to defeat inflation. Chair Jerome Powell has called his commitment to curbing price rises “unconditional,"" giving a boost to havens like Treasuries this week and providing a fresh impetus for defensives to outperform.   India's retail inflation is likely to breach the mandated inflation target band of 2-6% for three straight quarters but is showing indications of peaking, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) deputy governor Michael Patra said on Friday.   A day after the central government revised its fiscal deficit target for FY2023 and stated it will limit it to the current year's numbers Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram criticised the government over the state of the Indian economy, asking if it was in the ""pink of health"" over high fiscal deficit, inflation, and the depreciating value of the rupee.   Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Michael D Patra on Friday said the Central Bank will not allow ""jerky movements"" of Rupee and stressed that the Indian currency has witnessed least depreciation in recent times.   Once seen as an attractive inflation hedge due to its limited supply, the ongoing turmoil in cryptocurrencies is likely to make investors sceptical about it.   Multibagger stocks: Adani Green Energy shares have delivered stellar 6,200 per cent return in last 10 years   Stocks rose in Asia on Friday following another rally on Wall Street as investors try to process central bank moves to fight soaring inflation and the growing possibility that those measures will induce a recession. Global markets have been thrown into turmoil for months by a perfect storm of crises that have left observers predicting a sharp contraction, including the Ukraine war, China's lockdown-induced economic troubles, supply chain snarls and spiking energy costs. Expectations that the Federal Reserve and other central banks will have to keep lifting rates have left many traders fretting that the pain could go on for some time, with sovereign bond yields -- key gauges to future rates -- continuing to climb.   Oil prices edged higher amid a volatile trading session on Friday, as supply uncertainty outweighed fears of slower demand from cooling U.S. economic activity. Brent crude futures climbed 31 cents, or 0.3%, at $110.36 a barrel by 0630 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 59 cents, or 0.6%, at $104.86 a barrel.   European stocks rebounded at the open Friday following another week of heavy losses for markets, including oil, on heightened fears of a global recession. London's benchmark FTSE 100 index gained 0.4 percent to 7,047.11 points, with investors brushing aside bruising defeats for Britain's ruling Conservatives in by-elections Thursday. The pound was little changed against the dollar and euro, also despite data showing a drop in UK retail sales volumes as inflation soars. In the eurozone, Frankfurt's DAX index won 0.3 percent to 12,947.75 points and the Paris CAC 40 gained 0.7 percent to 5,922.45.   The Central government is reportedly going to become the biggest shareholder of debt-ridden Vodafone Idea Limited, according to CNBT-TV18. The Centre may hold 33% around in the company and become the single largest shareholder in the third-largest telco in the country, as per the business news channel.   Jet Airways began its operational hiring and asked its former cabin crew members to rejoin the airline.   As surging inflation and the end of global easy-money policies send Indian stocks spiraling down from all-time highs, three charts show the pain is unlikely to end anytime soon.. The selloff comes as climbing costs and a record plunge in the rupee have forced the nation’s central bank to join global peers in raising interest rates.   The US dollar slipped against its major peers on Friday, on course for its first weekly decline this month as investors continue to assess the path for Federal Reserve policy and whether aggressive rate hikes would trigger a recession. The safe-haven currency also lost support amid improved market sentiment, which saw regional stock markets rise and buoyed riskier currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rivals, sank 0.2% to 104.19 in Asia. That undid the previous day's 0.19% rise, which was driven mostly by a decline in the euro after weak European factory data reduced bets for European Central Bank tightening.   Shares of Nazara Technologies rallied about 20% to ₹623 apiece on the BSE in Friday's trading session as the stock started trading ex-bonus ahead of its record date for the bonus shares issue. Bonus shares are fully paid additional shares issued by a company to its existing shareholders.   Dividend paying stock REC Ltd is going to consider issuance of bonus shares on 30th June 2022. In its meeting on 30th June 2022, board of directors of REC Limited will consider the proposal for issue of bonus shares to the equity shareholders of the company. The board is expected to decide ratio of bonus shares in this meeting as well. Bonus shares, if approved, will be another good news for shareholders as the company has already given interim dividend of ₹6 per equity share for the financial year 2022.   The selling in Nifty has shown signs of slowing down this week, with the index consolidating within a 500-point range since Monday. In doing so, Nifty is now forming an inverse Head and Shoulder pattern on the hourly chart, which is a bullish pattern. The neckline of this pattern is placed near 15630-15650 levels. If the index sustains above this zone, the recovery could extend towards 15900-16170 in the next few sessions. On the downside, 15400-15370 now becomes the immediate support zone for Nifty.   Gold and silver prices in India struggled today amid weak global cues. On MCX, gold futures declined to near two-week lows of ₹50,510 per 10 gram. Silver futures were marginally higher at ₹59,510 per kg. In global markets, gold rates were flat at $1,824.72 per ounce and remained on course for their second straight weekly decline. So far this week, gold prices have dropped about 0.9%, on worries of aggressive rate hikes by global central banks to counter runaway inflation. Among other precious metals, spot silver rose 0.4% to $21.02 per ounce but is set for weekly loss.   In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin price today rose above $21,000 mark. The world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency rose more than 4% and was trading at $21,083. The global cryptocurrency market cap today was below the $1 trillion, and was up over 4% in the last 24 hours to $977 billion, as per CoinGecko.   As the saying goes, there is no easy money in this world, you must make effort to make money. In real estate investments too, it is possible to make money via smart tools and instruments.

Global oil benchmark Brent crude futures fell 0.21 per cent to USD 109.82 per barrel.   Financial stocks led Indian shares higher early on Friday, setting the blue-chip indexes on course for their first week of gains in three, as a slide in commodity prices tempered inflation fears. The NSE Nifty 50 index rose 0.85% to 15,689.65, while the S&P BSE Sensex climbed 0.77% to 52,668.26. If gains hold, the blue-chip indexes are set to post weekly gains of over 2.5% each. The Nifty Bank index rose as much as 1.7%, led by a 3.7% jump in private-sector lender IndusInd Bank. Oil explorer ONGC climbed up to 4.6% after it said its unit made a new oil discovery in Colombia.

Unlike a fixed deposit, which requires a lump-sum deposit to create an account, an RD allows you to invest on a monthly basis, similar to a mutual fund SIP, and receive interest rates that are comparable to fixed deposits. You can not only earn good returns on your RD by making monthly deposits, but you can also manage your emergency fund more effectively by not parking a lump sum amount at once. RD, like other deposit products, is insured by DICGC up to ₹5 lakhs, minimizing deposit security risk to almost zero. Because interest rates are rising, now is the ideal time to create an RD account. Here are the banks that have raised their recurring deposit interest rates promptly after the RBI raised the repo rate to 4.90 per cent.  On 17th June 2022, HDFC Bank made interest rate revisions on RDs across selected tenors. The bank is now offering a maximum interest rate of 5.75% to regular customers and 6.50% to senior citizens on recurring deposits.

This will be the second extension in the deadline for submission of the resolution plan for Reliance Capital. Previously, the Committee of Creditors (CoC) had extended the bid deadline from May 26 to June 20. Piramal Enterprises has written to the administrator to extend the deadline to August 10, sources aware of the matter said. Another bidder IndusInd Bank has also sought more time for resolution plan submission.

Sharing its top stock picks, ICICI Bank & Bandhan Bank are top buys, IndusInd Bank (IIB) looks attractive. Higher inflation & rates tend to have limited impact on banks' credit growth, but with divergent impact on corporate & retail credit growth. Bank's corporate credit growth improves in times of high inflation as working capital needs rise & bonds become costlier, the global brokerage said. “Banks are better margin-managers across rate cycles as they adjust credit/duration spreads etc. to manage extent of price hikes. We saw this in the recent Covid cycle as well when despite sharp cuts, spreads/margins were largely stable. Loan-mix, funding-mix & asset quality plays are bigger divers of NIM, rather than just interest rates,"" Jefferies added. As India gets firmly into inflation control & tracking global regulatory action, we look at FY11-14 period when high oil prices of $100-125/ bbl pushed up India's CPI to 10-11%. This, along with normalisation from GFC, led RBI to raise policy rates and hold them high till CPI moderated.  “Our India Strategist estimates RBI may raise policy rates by an additional 75-100 bps over next 6m, leading to total hike of 150-180 bps (in reverse repo/SDF terms). Additional CRR hikes might be used for OMOs to abate any surge in G-Sec yields,"" it added.

While mounting inflation continues to scare economic growth ahead, however, during this time finding a safe and affordable investment also needs attention, especially for elderlies. Senior citizens majorly search for a safe, guaranteed return, tax benefits, and risk-free investment schemes. Hence, fixed deposits emerge as a perfect answer for investors who do not want to face market risk. Did you know some banks offer higher than inflation rates on FDs? Just like other central banks, RBI has also hiked its interest rate earlier this week showcasing its commitment to bring down inflation that is well above its comfort zone and ensure sufficient liquidity. This has made FDs attractive while borrowing interest rates expensive. Four private banks offer inflation-beating rates on fixed deposits. The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate is at 6.95% in March. These four banks offer a 7% interest rate to senior citizens on their FDs below ₹2 crore. Here's the list: IndusInd Bank To senior citizens, IndusInd offers a 7% rate on tenures starting 2 years to below 61 months (5 years 1 month). It also has a 7% rate on its tax savings scheme with a term of 5 years. A tax exemption of ₹1.5 lakh is allowed under section 80C of the IT Act, from the income of FDs. IndusInd offers a 6.50% rate on tenures of 1 year to below 2 years, and 61 months and above. 6% rate is offered on tenures starting from 270 days to 364 days. Meanwhile, for the shorter term, the rates vary from 3.25% to 5.25% for senior citizens. Yes Bank: This private bank offers a 7% rate to senior citizens on tenures starting 3 years to less than or equal to 10 years. Also, it gives an annualised yield of 7.19% on the same tenures to the elderly. There is a 6.40% and 6.66% rate available on the tenure of 1 Year less than 18 months, and 18 months to less than 3 years. For shorter periods, Yes Bank's interest rate starts from 3.75% to 5.58% for the elderly. The minimum amount for creating an FD is Rs10,000. The actual number of days will be calculated at the time of booking. Over here, the minimum tenure is 7 days while the maximum is 10 years. RBL Bank: For deposits below ₹2 crore, RBL offers a 7% rate on only one tenure starting 24 months to less than 36 months to senior citizens. It gives a 6.80% rate maturing from 36 months to 60 months 1 day. Also, the same rate is offered on the tax-saving deposit scheme of 5 years. Further, a 6.75% rate applies on 12 months to less than 24 months tenure. RBL, meanwhile, offers a 6.25% rate on 60 months 2 days to 240 months tenure. For shorter periods, the rate varies from 3.75% to 5.75%. Over here the minimum tenure is 7 days while the maximum is 240 months. Senior Citizens (60 years and above) who are Resident Indians are eligible for an additional Interest rate of 0.5% per annum. Bandhan Bank: Earlier this week, Bandhan Bank revised its fixed deposits rate from May 4, 2022. It offers a 7% interest rate to senior citizens on deposits below ₹2 crore for tenures 2 years to less than 5 years. A 6.5% rate is given on 1 year to less than to years tenure. While FDs above 5 years to up to 10 years, earn an interest rate of 6.35%. For shorter periods such as less than 1 year, the interest rate varies from 3.75% to 5.25%. Fixed deposits have become more attractive after RBI's rate hike: This week, on May 4th, RBI surprised with a hike of 40 basis points on the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) to 4.40% with immediate effect. Further, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted to 4.15%, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate are set at 4.65%. On the rate hike, Prasenjit Basu – Chief Economist, ICICI Securities said, ""The whole structure of interest rates will harden, implying that loans will be costlier and fixed deposits more attractive."" Anjana Potti, Partner, J Sagar Associates (JSA) explained that the rate hike will have a significant impact on short-term deposits. On deposits, JSA Partner said, ""short and mid-term rates always rise quickest in response to any change in the interest rate cycle."" Experts believe the rate hike cycle has commenced tackling soaring inflation that plays spoilsports on the economy's growth trajectory. More rate hikes are on the cards ahead! Prasenjit Basu said, ""If the Russia-Ukraine war persists beyond May and June, more rate hikes will be needed. If there is an early end to the war (within the next 5-6 weeks), global inflationary pressures will ease, reducing pressure for further rate hikes."" If more policy rate hikes are on the table by RBI ahead, that would mean fixed deposit interest rates will rise going forward as well. However, the timeline and the quantum of the hike will depend upon banks and will be keenly watched."

Domestic share markets started off May on a tepid note, ending lower on Monday. Losses were largely led by auto, IT and capital goods stocks, while weak global cues added to the pressure. In Europe, stocks were mixed Monday and the dollar was steady as worries over high inflation, tightening monetary policy and China’s Covid lockdowns contributed to investor caution. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index followed Asian stocks lower in sessions affected by holiday closures. U.S. futures rose after April’s slump, among the worst since the pandemic roiled markets in 2020. Back home, the Sensex fell 84.88 points, or 0.15%, to end the day at 56,975.99, while Nifty fell 33.40 points to 17,069.10. About 1,201 shares advanced, 2,180 declined, and 175 were unchanged. Capital goods, auto and IT indices fell a percent each. Midcap and smallcap indices also ended in the red.   Sri Lanka has extended a credit line with India by $200 million in order to procure emergency fuel stocks, the country's power and energy minister said on Monday, with four shipments due to arrive in May. Colombo was also in talks with New Delhi over extending the credit line by an additional $500 million, minister Kanchana Wijesekera told a news conference.   German Chancellor Olaf Scholz plans to invite Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as special guest to a Group of Seven leaders’ summit next month as part of an effort to forge a broader international alliance against Russia. Germany, which currently holds the rotating G-7 presidency, will also welcome the leaders of Indonesia, South Africa and Senegal to the gathering in the Bavarian Alps June 26 to June 28, said people with knowledge of the matter. The decision could be announced as early as Monday, when Scholz welcomes Modi for talks in Berlin and a joint German-Indian cabinet meeting. Despite concerns over the prime minister’s reluctance to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a recent jump in India’s fossil-fuel imports from Russia, Scholz decided the G-7 should court India, according to people familiar with the matter.   Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday issued a yellow warning for Northwest India due to a Western Disturbance, soon after the heatwave spell subsided across the country. Senior scientist of IMD, RK Jenamani said that there are chances of the heatwave being over in most parts of India, including Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, as per the analysis of IMD today. However, there are chances of a heatwave in West Rajasthan and Vidarbha, but the major heatwave spell is ove   State-owned insurance behemoth LIC has said that it will retain part of its stake in IDBI Bank to reap the benefits of the bancassurance channel. Along with the government, Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) will also divest its stake in IDBI Bank, but may not exit completely, LIC Chairman MR Kumar told PTI in an interview. LIC is currently doing roadshows for its maiden public issue, which opens for subscription on May 4.   Oil prices fell on Monday as concerns about weak economic growth in China, the world's top oil importer, outweighed fears of potential supply stress from a potential European Union ban on Russian crude. Brent crude futures fell 71 cents, or 0.6%, to $106.43 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 70 cents, or 0.6%, to $103.99 a barrel.    After pencilling in RoAs of 0.4% for FY22, driving it up towards FY23 target of 0.75% and 1.0-1.5% by FY25 will require advance growth scale up to mid-teens and cost efficiencies, besides further improvement in NIM trajectory and sustained credit cost. We expect RoA profile of 0.6% / 0.7% for FY23E / FY24E. There is turnaround in relevant operating metrics and improved confidence in stability of franchise. Nonetheless, we remain cognisant of risks from delay in resolution of stress pool, net labelled exposure of 5.3%, modest RoE profile during transition and supply overhang post the expiry of lock-in shares. We maintain HOLD with an unchanged TP of Rs14.   European Union energy ministers will meet Monday to discuss Russia’s decision to cut gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland, and debate planned new sanctions over Moscow’s war on Ukraine. The 27 nation-bloc has imposed five rounds of sanctions on Russian officials, oligarchs, banks, companies and other organizations since Russian troops invaded Ukraine in February.   State-owned CIL on Monday said coal supply to the power sector rose 15.6 per cent to 49.7 million tonne last month in the wake of high demand of the dry fuel from electricity generating plants and stressed that it is planning to augment its dispatches further, especially to power plants in the coming months. The statement comes at a time when several parts of the country are grappling with power crisis. ""With the intense demand for coal continuing unabated driven by an upward spiral in the electricity generation, CIL (Coal India) pushed up its supplies to power plants of the country to 49.7 million tonnes (MT) in April'22. This is 6.7 MT more supply compared to April’21 when the power sector’s dispatch was 43 MTs,"" the maharatna firm said. With higher output, CIL is aiming to increase its dispatches further, especially to power plants in the coming months. Coal India, which accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output, is one of the major suppliers of fossil fuel to the power sector.   Outlook & Valuation: At the upper end of the price band the LIC IPO  is offered at P/EV (embedded value) of 1.1x as compared to other large listed private life insurance companies which are trading at multiples of 2.5-4.3x Sep’21 EV. Though there are concerns over LIC regarding market share loss in individual insurance business and historically lower margins, we believe that valuations factor in most of the negatives. Expected improvements in product mix and greater transfer of surplus to shareholders account over the coming years are expected to drive profits from current low levels, which along with cheap valuations provide comfort. The issue is priced in the range of ₹902-949.   European stocks fell in thin trade on Monday, pressured by heavyweights such as Mercedes-Benz trading ex-dividend, while data that signalled a steeper pace of contraction in China's factory activity also dampened risk appetite. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.8%, set to snap a three-day session of gains, although trading volumes were likely thinned by a UK bank holiday. Ex-dividend factors weighed heavily on the STOXX 600, with automaker Mercedes-Benz, healthcare company Bayer , auto parts maker Continental and chemical group BASF all losing their payout attraction.   Mumbai saw a 30% fall in property sale registrations of 11,744 units in April, compared to 16,726 units in March, contributing over ₹738 crore to the state revenue. However, the number of units registered in April 2022 was the best in a decade for the month of April, said property advisory Knight Frank India. Around 55% registrations were in the price band of above ₹1 crore while in terms of apartment size, mid-sized homes (between 500-1000 sq ft) were the most preferred category of property registered during the month. (Read here)   India's electricity demand touched a record high in April as its northern states reeled under the hottest pre-summer months in decades, with a surge in the use of air conditioning triggering the worst power crisis in more than six years. Power demand grew 13.2% to 135.4 billion kilowatt hours (kWh), as the electricity requirement in the north grew between 16% and 75%, a Reuters analysis of government data showed. Electricity use is expected to grow as India's weather office has forecast above normal maximum temperatures over most parts of the west central, northwest, north and northeast.   Mid-size motorcycle maker Royal Enfield, a subsidiary of Eicher Motors, on Monday said it has tied up with Italian riding gear brand Alpinestars to create a riding apparel collection with high protection and performance. Founded in 1963 in Asolo, Italy, Alpinestars is now a world-leading manufacturer of professional racing products, motorcycling airbag protection, high-performance apparel, gear and technical footwear. The partnership aims to provide Indian riders with the essential tools needed to make the best of their adventures, Royal Enfield said in a statement.   Shares of Tata Chemicals Ltd jumped more than 10% in Monday’s morning trade on the National Stock Exchange. This is on a day when the benchmark Nifty50 index was 0.7% down. What gives? The reason is simple. The company announced results for the fourth quarter of FY22 (Q4FY22) on Friday after market hours and performance has exceeded Street expectations. Plus, management commentary has been upbeat.   The company's sales grew 24% year-on-year to 295,308 units in April. Total two-wheelers sales also grew 24% to 280,022 units in April. Domestic two-wheeler sales grew 37% on year 180,533 units last month.   Stable Occupancies Led by Back-to-Office Drive Embassy REIT’s Q4FY22 revenue at ₹749 Cr was in line with our estimate amidst stable occupancies coupled with resilient collections after the pandemic. The occupancy was 87.1% on the total portfolio of 33.8 msf at the end of Q4FY22. Reported NOI margins are 82.4% and EBITDA margins improved to 76.7% due to a fall in indirect expenses. EMBASSY has Leased 2.2 msf at 18% spreads across 47 deals, achieved 14% rent escalations on 7.7 msf across 89 deals for FY22, focused on occupiers from high growth sectors such as SaaS, EV, and E-Commerce. The management has guided NOI of ₹2,710 Cr (on average) for FY23 and NDCF/distributions of ₹2,050 Bn. DPU guidance stands at ₹21.7 per unit for FY23 on a similar base of 948 Mn units. Furthermore, the office leasing momentum continues to grow backed by a healthy return to workplace trajectory coupled with robust hiring by technology and global captive players and record tech investments. The company remains focused on delivering growth to Unitholders and scaling up its industry-leading portfolio.   Gold prices fell on Monday as elevated U.S. Treasury yields pressured demand for zero-yield bullion, ahead of a widely expected big interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve to contain broadening inflationary pressures.  Spot gold was down 0.6% at $1,884.50 per ounce. US gold futures dropped 1.5% to $1,883.30.  The market is concerned that the Fed could be quite hawkish, pricing in a 50 basis point hike, and it could be 75 basis points in July, said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. The U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to begin its two-day meeting on May 3 and announce its decision the next day. U.S. Fed policymakers look set to deliver a series of aggressive rate hikes at least until the summer to deal with rapid inflation and surging labour costs, even as two reports released on Friday showed tentative signs that both may be cresting.   Maruti Suzuki India's Q4FY22 performance was ahead of expectations on the margin front, aided by operating leverage benefits, lower discounts, and price hikes.  With low inventory and a large order book, we expect MSIL to come back strongly in terms of profitability along with volume recovery. Going forward, near-term headwinds of chip shortages weighing on production and commodity cost pressures will weigh on MSIL’s financial performance. We expect margin contraction in H1FY23E and normalization in H2FY23E. We maintain our BUY rating on the stock with an unchanged TP of ₹9,800/share, valuing the stock at 27x its FY24E EPS. The TP implies an upside of 27% from the CMP.   Q4FY22 Results: IndusInd Bank reported a healthy performance. GNPA down 21 bps QoQ to 2.27%. Restructured book down 70 bps to 2.6% Total loan related provisions declined to 3.5% vs. 3.7% QoQ Loan growth up 12.4% YoY and microfinance picked up with 18% YoY while deposits were up 15% YoY NII up 12.7% YoY, NIMs improved QoQ to 4.2%, PAT at | 1361 crore What should investors do? IndusInd Bank’s share price has gained ~1.8x in the past 18 months. We believe the bank will show improved business traction with corporate book adding to the momentum. We retain our BUY rating on the stock Target Price and Valuation: We value the bank at ~1.6x FY24E ABV and maintain a target price of ₹1150 per share.   Factory activity in India picked up last month, bolstered by a solid increase in demand as pandemic restrictions were eased, but rising energy prices pushed input costs to a five-month high, a private survey showed. International demand also jumped robustly to a 9-month high after contracting in March and domestic demand was above average. The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index compiled by S&P Global, improved to 54.7 in April from 54.0 in March.   Wipro Ltd's March quarter earnings were disappointing.  In Q4FY22, IT services revenue grew 3.1% in constant currency (CC) terms sequentially, missing consensus estimate of 3.4%. Ebit margin declined 60 basis points sequentially to 17%. Ebit is short for earnings before interest and tax. One basis point is one hundredeth of a percentage point. Analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd note that Ebit margin is the lowest since 1QFY19 levels impacted adversely by the dilutive impact of acquisitions made by Wipro through the past 18 months. (Read here)   Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. today announced that its overall auto sales for the month of April 2022 stood at 45640 vehicles. Mahindra’s farm equipment segment sold 39,405 units in India during April, up 51% on year. Shares of the company traded 0.8% higher at ₹929.55 apiece on the BSE.   Wipro’s 4QFY22 IT services revenue grew by 3.1% QoQ/28.5% YoY in constant currency (CC) to $2.7bn, in line with our estimates. Sequential growth came at 3.1% in CC terms, vs. our estimate of 3%. EBIT margin of IT services business is at 17%, broadly in line with our estimate of 17.1%, due to high attrition rate. Net income stood at Rs30.9bn (up 4% QoQ/up 4% YoY), 2.6% higher than our expectation of Rs30.1bn. Nine large deal TCV signed with a combined TCV of over $400mn in 4QFY22. Management guided for 1QFY23 revenue from IT Services business to be at $2.75-2.80bn. This translates into a sequential growth of 1-3%.  We expect the restructuring efforts, which include a simplified operating structuring, step-up in capability upgrade and talent management to bode well for WPRO in the medium term. However, margin pressure would continue. We lower FY23E-FY24E EPS estimates by 6% each, factoring weak margin profile. We retain our BUY recommendation and revise the target price to Rs570 (vs. the prior Rs720) and value the stock at 21x (earlier 25x) FY24E earnings. At CMP, Wipro trades at 18.7x FY24E EPS, which is at 26%/17% discount to the larger peers (TCS/Infosys).   The markets are likely to see gap down opening, SGX Nifty is down 200 points compared to Friday’s spot Nifty closing. Asian markets trading in red with Nikkei is down 0.5%, while Hang Seng is closed for labour day.   Jet fuel prices on Sunday were hiked by 3.22% to an all-time high, reflecting a surge in global energy prices. This was the ninth straight increase this year. The price of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) was raised by ₹3,649.13 per kilolitre, or 3.22%, to ₹1,16,851.46 per kl ( ₹116.8 per litre) in the national capital, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.   Shares of RIL, HDFC, Maruti, Wipro, Yes Bank, Tata Motors, Adani group will be in focus today. HDFC, Britannia Industries, Alembic Pharmaceuticals, Adani Wilmar, Castrol India, Devyani International, IDBI Bank, Inox Leisure, JBM Auto, Jindal Stainless, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services, Meghmani Organics are among the key companies scheduled to announce their earnings today   Dalal Street has been bustling as a record 34.6 million new investors flocked to the bourses last fiscal. With this, India clocked 89.7 million dematerialized (demat) accounts by the end of March 2022, registering a jump of 63% in FY22, data from the Securities and Exchange Board of India showed. In FY21, the demat tally had risen nearly 35% to 55.1 million. The relentless rally in stocks since the outbreak of the pandemic has lured younger and tech-savvy cohorts. (Read here)   Growth in the eight infrastructure sectors of the economy slowed in March after recovering to a four-month high in the previous month after supply-side disruptions caused a contraction in coal and crude oil output and a slowdown in some others. The sectors—coal, crude, natural gas, refinery products, fertilizers, cement, steel and electricity—expanded by 4.3% in March from 6% in February, data released by the ministry of commerce and industry showed on Friday. However, fertilizers, cement and electricity posted a swift recovery.   With the last two weeks of range-bound movement, the daily time frame chart exhibits a ‘Triangle’ pattern and prices are inching closer to their apex point. Hence, the breakout in either direction is imminent. As of now, we expect it to happen in the northward direction where 17400 – 17450 are the levels to watch out for. The moment we surpass this, we could see a lot of individual stocks participating in the next leg of the rally. This view would be negated if the index slides and sustains below the lower range. Most of the key indices are placed at a crucial juncture and they are waiting for some trigger to make a move. We hope to witness a much-awaited breakout in the early part of May which will certainly bring back a wider smile in the traders’ fraternity.   Oil prices fell on Monday in holiday-sapped trade in Asia as concerns about slowing economic growth in China, the world's top oil importer, outweighed fears of potential supply disruptions from a looming European Union ban on Russian crude. Brent crude futures fell $1.21, or 1.1%, to $105.93 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 99 cents, or 1%, to $103.70 a barrel. Markets in Japan, India and across Southeast Asia were closed for public holidays on Monday. Prices fell after China released data on Saturday showing that factory activity in the world's second-largest economy contracted for a second month to its lowest since February 2020 because of COVID lockdowns.   Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange fell 266.50 points, or 1.56%, to 16,860 in early deals on Monday, signalling a weak start for Indian benchmarks. On Friday, the benchmark Sensex fell 460 points to close at closed at 57,060.87, led by losses in banking, IT, and energy shares. The Nifty tanked 142.50 points to end the day at 17,102.55.   Stock markets in Japan, Australia, and South Korea fell on Monday, while US equity futures struggled as high inflation, tightening monetary policy and China’s Covid lockdowns deepened concerns about the global economic outlook.  Markets in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand are closed on Monday for public holidays. S&P 500 futures rose 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.2%.  Japan’s Topix index shed 0.2%, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 1.1%, and South Korea’s Kospi index fell 0.7%. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates by a half point Wednesday, the largest increase since 2000. The question is how high it needs to go to get runaway inflation under control and whether that will trigger a recession. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 900 points as another sharp sell-off led by technology stocks added to Wall Street's losses in April. The benchmark S&P 500 fell 3.6% and finished April with an 8.8% loss, its worst monthly slide since March 2020.  The Nasdaq composite, heavily weighted with technology stocks, bore the brunt of the damage this month, ending April with a 13.3% loss, its biggest monthly decline since the 2008 financial crisis.  "

The private sector lender, with a balance sheet of ₹4 trillion, is looking at growth opportunities in both assets and liabilities to achieve this target. “We are launching a home loan product and scaling up our tractor business. We see huge opportunity to scale up affordable housing business from ₹2,000 crore to ₹5,000 crore. We believe merchant acquiring business which is currently at ₹2,000 crore will expand to ₹4,500 crore. We have already got 377 merchants,"" said Sumant Kathpalia, managing director and chief executive officer, Indusind Bank, in the earnings call. “On the liability side we have an affluent business with an AUM (assets under management) of ₹60,000 crore, which will touch ₹1 lakh crore (1 trillion). We are also focussed on our NRI business which currently has an AUM of ₹27,000 crore and agency business,"" he added. It reported a 51% jump in net profit to ₹1,401 crore in the quarter ended 31 March from ₹926 core a year ago.

Net interest margins (NIM), a test of profitability, improved to 4.2% at the end of March quarter from 4.10% in the previous quarter. Kathpalia guided for NIM of 4.1-4.25% in FY23. Other income rose 7% at ₹1,905 crore during the quarter. Indusind Bank’s asset quality also improved this quarter. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of total assets shrank to 2.27% from 2.48% in the previous quarter while net NPA came at 0.64% as compared to 0.71% in the earlier quarter. The bank set aside lower funds in the fourth quarter with provisions and contingencies declining 21.5% to ₹1,464 crore as compared to ₹1,866 crore a year ago. The bank’s diamond business, which constitutes 4% of total loan book, was impacted due to the Ukraine crisis. The management, however, remains sanguine about the health of the portfolio. “We see slowdown on business. But over a period of time, it will normalize. It does not imply there will be credit default from this business. Credit flows and working capital cycle is going on fine,"" added Kathpalia. The bank saw 12% growth in advances to ₹2.39 trillion as of 31 March as against ₹2.12 trillion a year ago. Deposit growth stood at 15% to ₹2.93 trillion as against ₹2.55 trillion a year ago.

Ltd for ₹4,500 crore, in the biggest buyout yet in India’s ₹38 trillion asset management industry. In a statement issued on Wednesday, Infrastructure Development Finance Co. Ltd, the parent of IDFC AMC, said the Bandhan-led consortium was selected through a “highly competitive divestment process"", and the deal envisages continuity of the current management team and investment processes at IDFC AMC. “This will be supplemented well by Bandhan’s brand as well as GIC’s and CC’s international network and experience, which will aid IDFC AMC in further cementing its position in the asset management industry and propel further growth,"" IDFC said. IDFC AMC, the ninth-largest mutual fund in the country, had assets under management (AUM) of ₹1.15 trillion as of 31 March. Accordingly, the deal valued IDFC AMC at 3.9% of its latest AUM. While the transaction aids IDFC’s plan to exit non-core businesses and reverse-merge with IDFC Bank Ltd, it also helps Bandhan Financial make a beachhead in India’s fast-growing MF industry. Said Anil Singhvi, chairman of IDFC, “This transaction is a significant milestone in our plan of unlocking value, and the consideration demonstrates the strong position of IDFC AMC in the Indian mutual fund space. We have achieved signing within six months of the board’s decision to divest, which further demonstrates IDFC board’s commitment to consummate the merger of IDFC Ltd and IDFC Financial Holding Co. with IDFC First Bank."" The Bandhan-led consortium beat private sector lender IndusInd Bank Ltd and another consortium led by American fund manager Invesco to win IDFC AMC, two people aware of the matter said. “ChrysCapital will be spearheading the consortium as far as leadership management and the business structure post the buyout by the Bandhan Financial-led consortium is concerned. The deal has been finalized at ₹4,500 crore, which is 2.2% of IDFC AMC’s average AUM for March quarter,"" one of the two people said on condition of anonymity. He added that as IDFC AMC has more debt-oriented MF schemes, the deal has been done somewhat at the lower end of the average industry valuation given for acquiring mutual fund businesses. Ashish Agarwal, managing director of ChrysCapital, said, “ChrysCapital is very excited to partner with BFHL and GIC to buy out IDFC AMC, a quality platform with a seasoned management team. The company is well poised for the future with strong industry tailwinds including increasing financialization of savings and a growing equity culture among the younger generation."" “While Bandhan Bank will bring in 60% of the investment to acquire IDFC AMC, ChrysCapital and GIC will invest 20% each to acquire the mutual fund business entirely from the shareholders of IDFC,"" the person cited earlier said. Last week, IDFC’s investment banker Citigroup Global Markets, submitted its proposal to the board with the names and bids of finalists. The proposed sale of IDFC AMC is in line with IDFC Group’s objective to reverse-merge with IDFC First Bank Ltd and focus on banking operations after selling off profitable non-core assets. Karni S. Arha, managing director of Bandhan Financial Holdings, said, “The acquisition of IDFC AMC provides us with a scaled-up asset management platform, with a stellar management team and a pan-India distribution network."" On 24 February, Mint reported that the Hinduja family led IndusInd Bank Ltd was one of the top three contenders to buy IDFC AMC."

Updated: 08 Mar 2022,Dish TV to move SAT against Sebi's order ,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/dish-tv-to-move-sat-against-sebi-s-order-11646727030942.html,"Mumbai: Dish TV India is planning to appeal against the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (Sebi) interim order asking the company to disclose the results of its annual general meeting held in December within 24 hours, according to a stock exchange notice on Tuesday. “The Company is preferring an Appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal in respect of the said Order,"" it said in the notice. On Monday, Sebi had issued show cause notices to the company’s directors asking why the meeting results have not been disclosed so far despite repeated advisories from the regulator. The satellite television services provider did not disclose the results of the annual general meeting citing a pending case in the Bombay high court. Financial creditors, led by Yes Bank, which own 45% stake in Dish TV is said to have voted to oust the present directors and promoter, Jawahar Lal Goel. Sebi had asked the depositories to immediately freeze the demat accounts of the company's directors and the compliance officer till the voting results of the AGM held last year are disclosed on the stock exchanges or till further orders. Sebi noted that the high court had in its order dated 23 December, while rejecting any ad-interim relief, did not prohibit the company from disclosing the outcome of the AGM. But the company by taking an erroneous plea that the matter is sub-judice, has been delaying the disclosure, knowing fully well that there is no such order restraining the company from disclosing the outcome of the AGM, it said. Subsequently, the high court observed that the pendency of the Dish TV case will have no bearing on the disclosure requirements of SEBI. “Despite issuance of the above quoted clarification by the Hon’ble Bombay High Court itself and repeated advisories issued by SEBI, the Company Interim Order in the matter of Dish TV India Limited has not disclosed the results of voting in the AGM held on December 30, 2021 even after a passage of 68 days since the date of AGM,"" the order said. Sebi’s interim order came after it received complaints from Yes Bank alleging that Dish TV had wrongfully withheld the results of voting on various proposals put forth in its AGM. IndusInd Bank also requested Sebi to take appropriate action against the company for non-compliance and for misinterpreting the high court’s order."

On Wednesday as well, the stock fell around 5% on the NSE in the morning trade. This, despite the company reporting robust earnings performance in the December quarter on 8 February.   Telecom operator Bharti Airtel's consolidated net profit dipped 2.8% to ₹830 crore for the third quarter ended December 2021 from ₹854 crore in the same quarter year ago. Shares of Bharti Airtel rose to ₹710 apiece on the BSE in Wednesday's opening deals. What should investors do?   India’s central bank is set to stick with baby steps to policy normalization, as it is seized by the need to anchor borrowing costs for the government in addition to supporting a durable recovery in Asia’s third-largest economy. Those objectives will likely make the benchmark interest-rate a sideshow at this week’s monetary policy review, which is due Thursday. The Reserve Bank of India will instead likely raise the reverse repurchase rate to cut down inflation-inducing liquidity in the banking system -- a signal that it’s committed to return policy to pre-pandemic settings. But the key takeaway from Governor Shaktikanta Das’s address at 10 a.m. in Mumbai on Thursday will be how the RBI plans to support the government’s record 14.95 trillion rupee ($200 billion) borrowing plan in a market where demand is flagging.   4 stocks to buy or sell today — 9th February   Here is the list of the top 10 stocks that are likely to be in focus on Wednesday   Japanese shares rose on Wednesday, underpinned by overnight strength on Wall Street, as investors hunted for companies that reported strong results as the earnings season nears its peak. By 02:01 GMT, the Nikkei share average rose 0.8% to 27,500.36, while the broader Topix advanced 0.72% to 1,950.72. Wall Street ended sharply higher overnight, lifted by big technology firms such as Apple and Microsoft, while a jump in Treasury yields elevated bank stocks ahead of a key inflation reading this week.   The rupee edged lower by 5 paise to close at 74.74 against the US dollar on Tuesday as stronger greenback, elevated crude oil prices and foreign fund ouflows weighed on forex market sentiment. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 74.65 a dollar and later touched an intra-day high of 74.57 and a low of 74.80. The local unit finally ended the day at 74.74, down 5 paise from the previous close. In the previous session on Friday, the rupee had settled at 74.69 against the greenback.   Gold prices were steady on Wednesday near a two-week high scaled in the previous session, as inflationary risks and Russia-Ukraine tensions underpinned the safe-haven metal, despite the prospect of an aggressive rate hike by the U.S. central bank. Fundamentals * Spot gold was steady at $1,825.89 per ounce by 0108 GMT, hovering close to Tuesday's high of $1,828.68. U.S. gold futures dipped 0.1% to $1,826.30. * Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields were steady, but slightly lower compared with the November 2019 high reached in the previous session. [USD/][US/] * U.S. inflation data for January is due on Thursday and expectations are for a 7.3% annual rise, according to a Reuters poll, after robust labour data last week. * Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. Higher rates also boost the dollar, pressuring the greenback-priced precious metal.   Oil prices nudged up on Wednesday following two sessions of losses after industry data showed an unexpected drop in U.S. crude and fuel stocks, offsetting concerns of a possible rise in supplies from Iran. Brent crude futures rose 23 cents, or 0.3%, to $91.01 a barrel by 0122 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $89.47 a barrel, up 11 cents, or 0.1%.

U.S. crude, gasoline and distillate stocks fell last week, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday. Crude inventories fell 2 million barrels, according to API, versus analysts' expectations of a 400,000-barrel increase.   Technology companies and banks helped drive stocks higher on Wall Street Tuesday, as the market bounced back from an early slide to more than make up its losses from the day before. The S&P 500 rose 0.8per cent after having been down 0.4per cent. More than three fourths of the stocks in the benchmark index notched gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1per cent and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.3per cent. Bond yields rose, lifting the 10-year Treasury yield to the highest level since before the pandemic began.

The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was up 0.80 percent, or 218.17 points, at 27,502.69 in early trade, while the broader Topix index edged up 0.69 percent, or 13.40 points, to 1,947.46. After a tailwind from the rebound of Wall Street shares following a batch of mostly solid earnings, the Japanese market's ""focus is now on Toyota's earnings,"" later in the trading day, senior market analyst Toshiyuki Kanayama of Monex said in a note.   Chinese state-backed funds’ intervention in domestic stock markets Tuesday is rekindling hope that a bottom is near for the nation’s battered equities. The CSI 300 Index ended down just 0.6% at the close on Tuesday, paring an earlier slump of 2.4%, which was its biggest intraday drop since August. State-related funds entered the market to buy local shares in the afternoon session, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked to not be identified because the matter is private. Meanwhile, U.S.-listed Chinese stocks gained overnight, with technology names including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Pinduoduo Inc. leading the way.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 index rose 0.77% Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index increased 0.48% South Korea’s Kospi index rose 0.74% Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 1.63% China’s Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.11%   -Earnings: AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Toyota Motor, Twitter, Uber, Walt Disney -Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester speaks Wednesday -UK Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey speaks Thursday -US consumer price index, initial jobless claims Thursday   Stocks rose Wednesday and a selloff in sovereign bonds paused, bringing some relief for markets from the concerns about tightening monetary policy that have whipsawed assets this year. Shares climbed in Japan, South Korea and Australia, while U.S. equity futures advanced. The S&P 500 closed near session highs, dip-buying lifted the Nasdaq 100 and a U.S. small-cap gauge outperformed. Sentiment in Asia may get a boost from China, where state-backed funds intervened in the stock market Tuesday, helping the benchmark index stage a recovery from its biggest intraday drop since August 2021. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index jumped. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield inched lower but remained in sight of levels last seen in 2019 as the Federal Reserve gears up to raise interest rates to quell inflation. A dollar gauge fluctuated.

The application was filed under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The bank, a financial creditor to Zee Entertainment, claimed the company defaulted on a loan of ₹83 crore. Zee Entertainment is a party to the Debt Service Reserve Account Guarantee Agreement (DSRA) entered into with IndusInd for a term loan facility advanced to Siti Networks Ltd, an exchange filing by the company said. Under the agreement, IndusInd Bank extended a ₹400 crore debt facility to Siti Networks, a unit of Zee Entertainment. The loan was sanctioned against a guarantee provided by the promoter group. As per the agreement, IndusInd issued a notice to Zee Entertainment for accelerated payment of the entire amount in October 2020. Zee has been contesting that, as a guarantor, its liability is limited to an amount equivalent to one quarter’s interest and a further amount equivalent to one quarter’s principal instalment as and when due. In December 2021, Zee Entertainment agreed to merge with Sony Pictures Networks India. Sony will hold a majority stake in the merged company, and the Zee promoter family will own 3.99% with an option to increase its stake up to 20% from the market. The broadcaster is also locked in a legal tussle with its majority shareholders—Invesco Developing Markets Fund and OFI Global China Fund. The matter pertains to Invesco Developing Markets Fund’s petition wherein it requisitioned Zee Entertainment Enterprises to hold an extraordinary general meeting. The matter is currently pending before the Bombay high court and other forums."

Updated: 21 Dec 2021,‘Connected ecosystem banking will emerge soon’,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/connected-ecosystem-banking-will-emerge-soon-11640085507208.html,"Mumbai: Banks are gradually moving towards platforms and application programming interface (API)-led ecosystems to build innovative business models. Amid the rapid digital transformation, regulations and compliance norms set by the government will define how banking evolves. In an interview, Biswabrata Chakravorty, head, IT, IndusInd Bank, spoke about how the private sector lender has created differentiated customer experience offerings through APIs. Edited excerpts: How has IndusInd Bank leveraged tech to deliver value to businesses? We embarked on the digital journey much before the pandemic hit us. While the one-and-a-half years have been tough, it has expedited digitization as well as the focus and speed of innovation. We began with automating the manual processes by leveraging technologies like customer relationship management (CRM), robotics and others. Then, we focused on creating the right digital architecture by taking the hybrid cloud approach. This enabled us to rapidly scale, provision and create multiple application infrastructure in a very short time. We can monetize the infrastructure for application design and ensure rapid delivery of customer experience. Data lake is another area that we focused on. We have got a data lake that enables us to rapidly ingest huge volumes of data. We use cloud capabilities to analyse data, and open source to mine the data and generate statistical models. Our efforts concentrated on creating a differentiated customer experience through APIs. We have created an unassisted or do-it-yourself customer journey for practically every product. The tech platforms are helping us deliver these journeys to the customers, which are completely paperless and seamless with no human intervention. For instance, we have stitched the entire loan journey with alm-ost 40 APIs; they are running in an orchestrated manner. What are the pillars for the bank’s digital strategy? There are three areas that will underpin how we have prepared ourselves for digital strategy. First, we want to take an overview of end-to-end customer experience. Our ultimate objective is to remove friction, optimize processes and create an impact on the customer journey. We are also conscious of the fact that no technology stack will function smoothly for delivering customer experience if it doesn’t have a foundational API management framework to support it. Hence, the second strategy for delivering superior customer experience is to have a robust layer which is enabled through APIs. To deliver a good customer experience, you need a strong API framework. And we have been able to do it because we have a strong API platform to support digital customer experiences. With our hybrid cloud approach, we have created a technology infrastructure, which is scalable and resilient. This ensures all the customer services are delivered in a reliable manner. Second, we have invested significantly in data warehousing and analytical capabilities. We want our analytical units, like the campaign management team, to be able to use data and run campaigns in a targeted manner. The third pillar is organization and governance structure. Having the right operational process to deliver the technology and the right governance structure helps. How are you maintaining operational resiliency and ensuring there are no lapses in digital engagement with customers? The crux lies in the way we architect our infrastructure and how we have scaled up the private and hybrid cloud. We have kept redundancies with the design and physical deployment architecture. Besides, we are not using cloud to optimize our costs but for better reliability. How will banking services evolve in the near future? Every industry got disrupted due to the pandemic. So was the banking sector. Customer experience rules the roost and there will be a huge demand for all the technologies that will help in creating a differentiated customer experience. We will also see the emergence of connected ecosystem banking—an area that will witness a lot of innovation. The regulatory and compliance landscape will play a key role in determining what is going to be banking’s future."
