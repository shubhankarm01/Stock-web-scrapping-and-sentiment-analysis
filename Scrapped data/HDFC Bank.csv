Updated: 09 Jul 2022,Investors wealth rises near ₹7.73 lakh cr this week on bullish markets,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/investors-wealth-rises-near-rs-7-73-lakh-cr-this-week-on-bullish-markets-will-this-trend-continue-11657361726408.html,"Indian markets closed this week on a bullish note with Sensex nearing 54,500 and Nifty 50 above 16,200. On Friday, the benchmarks maintained their winning streak and settled in the green for the third day in a row despite mixed global cues. Overall, the week was positive and investors added notable gains in their portfolios. The bullish performance can be attributed to consolidation in commodity prices and a slowdown in foreign funds outflow. Investors' wealth on BSE skyrocketed by nearly ₹7.73 lakh crore this week. Going forward, the seesaw sentiment stays on the broader markets, however, the focus will shift to June 2022 quarterly earnings. On Friday, Sensex closed at 54,481.84 up by 303.38 points or 0.56%. Nifty 50 ended at 16,220.60 up by 87.70 points or 0.54%. A broad-based buying was seen across sectoral indices with capital goods outperforming and banking stocks also supporting the gains. Metal stocks were under pressure. Both Sensex and Nifty 50 have climbed more than 3% this week. The market cap of BSE stood at nearly ₹2,51,59,998.80 crore by end of July 8. The valuation has risen by ₹7,72,870.07 crore from the market cap of ₹2,43,87,128.73 crore on July 1.  Among the top 10 most valued companies on BSE, Reliance Industries (RIL) continues to lead with a market cap of ₹16,17,879.36 crore followed by TCS at ₹11,94,625.39 crore and HDFC Bank at ₹7,75,832.15 crore. Infosys and HUL also took the fourth and fifth spots with a market cap of ₹6,37,033.78 crore and ₹5,86,422.74 crore respectively. Others were - ICICI Bank with a market cap of ₹5,25,656.96 crore, LIC at ₹4,47,841.46 crore, SBI at ₹4,35,922.66 crore, HDFC at ₹4,06,213.61 crore and Bharti Airtel at ₹3,81,833.20 crore. Talking about this week's performance, Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, “During the week, the domestic market saw a bull run, led by consolidation in commodity prices, and reduced FII selling. Crude prices fell over recessionary fears. However, the fall has boosted the appetite for consumption, chemicals, logistics, and OMCs as it will reduce the cost burden of these sectors.""  Nair explained that falling crude prices will calm inflationary fears, reducing the burden on central banks to raise interest rates aggressively at upcoming meetings. Positive domestic macro and business data by banks were the other major factors that helped in boosting market sentiment.  He further said, currently, investors are preferring value than growth stocks, resulting in selling across sectors like IT. Defensive sectors like FMCG can perform better due to strong cash flow, high governance, dividend policy, and stable earnings growth. This month, FPI funds outflow stood at ₹4,418 crore as of July 8 from the Indian market (including equity, debt, debt-VRR, and hybrid market). Overall, this year, FPIs have pulled out a massive ₹2,31,708 crore from the market, as per NSDL data. So far in 2022, FPIs have only emerged as net sellers due to turmoil in macroeconomic factors. Meanwhile, the rupee has hit a series of all-time lows. On Friday, the local unit closed at 79.26 against the US dollar at the interbank forex market down by 13 paise amidst a strong greenback, persistent foreign funds outflow, and a slight rebound in crude prices. However, Nair also pointed out that this rally can fizzle out as correction in commodities prices & tightening monetary policy are negative for the global economy, limiting earnings growth & valuation expansion. Markets June 11 to June 15 outlook: Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives, Samco Securities said, ""the coming week is going to test the market in a number of ways as a multitude of important events are lined up. The USA’s much-anticipated inflation numbers, Producer Price Index (PPI), and the jobless claims data will keep the global markets on their toes. The inflationary problem is not just restricted to the west thus the Indian inflation numbers that are set to release will keep the markets back home busy. The Retail inflation eased to 7.04% in May vs. 7.79% in April, whether the declining trend continues or not is something that is keenly awaited."" ""Aside from macro data, quarterly results will influence market sentiment. The management commentary on future earnings growth trajectory will be of interest to D-street. With a slew of important events coming up, investors are advised to be careful and cautious in their investment decisions,"" Sheth added. Nair added, that the Q1 earnings season will be the prime focus of the market, in the near term. Giving an outlook on Nifty, Sheth said, in the short term, it may face stiff resistance around 16,200 levels. If it maintains above that level, the next obstacle could be around 16,500 levels. On the downside, 16,000 will serve as a strong support level. ICICI Direct analysts have given a bullish stance on markets ahead. The outlook is anchored on twin key observations - a) Breach of the key downward trend line which is in force since April 2022 indicating the end of the two-month corrective phase b) Current pull back is qualitatively better as compared with earlier pullbacks since April in terms of market breadth (measured by the percentage of stocks above 50 DMA (51%) strongest in two months indicating broad-based participation). Amongst sectors, BFSI, IT, Auto, Consumption, and capital goods are preferred while Pharma witnesses stock-specific action. On stocks, ICICI Direct analysts said, ""we prefer SBI, HDFC bank, Infosys, Tata Motors, DLF, L&T, Titan in large caps while in midcaps we prefer ABB, SKF, Persistent, Apollo Tyres, M&M Finance, Bajaj Electricals, Phoenix Mills, CCL Products, Indian Hotels, and Kansai Nerolac."" TCS and Avenue Supermarts stock will be in focus after their Q1 results. Companies like HCL Tech, HDFC Bank, Mindtree, Tata Metaliks, ACC, L&T Infotech, Tata Elxsi, JSPL, Federal Bank, and L&T Technology Services will also be in focus ahead of their quarterly earnings scheduled next week.

Updated: 08 Jul 2022,SBI vs HDFC vs ICICI vs IDFC vs Post Office vs RBL vs Yes Bank: Check RD rates,https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/sbi-vs-hdfc-vs-icici-vs-idfc-vs-post-office-vs-rbl-vs-yes-bank-check-rd-rates-11657274580845.html,"A recurring deposit (RD) is one of the most well-liked debt investment products in the voyage of personal finance when it comes to establishing a secure investment by making monthly contributions and avoiding lump sums.

Therefore, individuals searching for SIP-like deposits can compare the interest rates here of recurring deposits of some top financial institutions by eliminating lump-sum deposits in fixed deposits.  State Bank of India (SBI), the largest lender in the nation, gives the same interest rates on FDs and RDs.

Updated: 08 Jul 2022,How an Indian cement maker bought Russian coal using yuan,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/exclusive-how-an-indian-cement-maker-bought-russian-coal-using-yuan-11657240560306.html,"An Indian cement maker's recent purchase of Russian coal using yuan involved India's biggest private lender, HDFC Bank, according to an invoice seen by Reuters and a source, as more details emerge of the kind of trade that could blunt Western sanctions against Moscow. There is no suggestion that the purchase, the particulars of which have not previously been reported, in any way breaches sanctions imposed on Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. But the document shows one way in which Russia could continue to sell commodities abroad without settling in U.S. dollars despite restrictions aimed at freezing it out of financial markets. According to the invoice dated June 5 and a source familiar with the matter, HDFC Bank backed cement maker Ultratech's purchase of Russian coal from producer and trader SUEK for 172.7 million yuan ($25.74 million). The letter of credit for the deal was issued by HDFC Bank's Mumbai suburban branch of Andheri East, according to the invoice.  The dollar is the currency of choice for global trade in raw materials, but some traders say the yuan could be increasingly used to settle payments for supplies from Russia.  In the invoice, SUEK requests Ultratech remit the 172.7 million yuan to SUEK's account at the Shanghai branch of China Everbright Bank. SUEK lists the Hong Kong branch of international lender HSBC as the correspondent bank.  A correspondent bank acts as a middleman in the transfer of money from one bank to another. Reuters could not determine if a payment had been received by China Everbright or if HSBC or any other bank was involved in a transfer of funds.  HDFC Bank and HSBC declined to comment. Ultratech, SUEK and China Everbright Bank did not respond to requests for comment. It was not clear from the invoice which currencies were used to effect the yuan payment.  The amount listed was quoted in Chinese yuan and Reuters reported last week that Ultratech imported 157,000 tonnes of coal from Switzerland-registered SUEK and agreed to settle the final payment in that currency. YUAN TRADES STILL RARE For India, such payment methods could become more common as it seeks to maintain trade ties with Russia for commodities including oil and coal without the risk of contravening Western sanctions. India has deep political and security ties with Russia and has refrained from condemning the Ukraine war, which Russia says is a ""special military operation"". India's energy imports from Russia have soared recently as traders, unable to sell into many Western markets, have offered steep discounts. New Delhi defends its purchases of Russian goods, saying they are legal and that a sudden halt would inflate prices further and hurt consumers. Greater use of the yuan to settle payments could help insulate Moscow from punishment and bolster Beijing's push to further internationalise the yuan and chip away at the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global trade. It is, however, still rare for an Indian firm to agree to settle a trade with a non-Chinese company in yuan. In the absence of sanctions, overseas payments to Russian commodity and energy companies would typically be made in dollars via SWIFT to Russian accounts. For Indian trade settlements using the yuan, lenders would potentially send dollars to foreign banks with sufficient yuan reserves, or Chinese banks they have tie-ups with, in exchange for yuan to settle the trade. The invoice mentioned the SWIFT transaction IDs of both HSBC's Hong Kong branch and China Everbright's Shanghai branch. Reuters could not confirm whether any payment was made using the SWIFT platform. SWIFT is a secure messaging system that facilitates rapid cross-border payments, making international trade flow smoothly. Several Russian banks have been cut off from the system in recent months. ""As a matter of policy, SWIFT does not comment on flows between institutions,"" a spokesman said. India's bilateral trade with China, for which companies largely pay in dollars, has flourished even after a deadly military border clash between the two in 2020 that ratcheted up tensions that have still not subsided. New Delhi has increased scrutiny on Chinese investments and imports, and banned some mobile apps over security concerns. The Indian government and the central bank were aware of potential payments for Russian cargo in Chinese yuan, sources told Reuters last week. The government and central bank did not comment for this article."
Updated: 07 Jul 2022,SBI vs ICICI vs HDFC vs BoB vs PNB vs Axis Bank: Check home loan rates,https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/sbi-vs-icici-vs-hdfc-vs-bob-vs-pnb-vs-axis-bank-check-home-loan-rates-11657192950652.html,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) increased the repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.9 percent at its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in June. This had an effect on the retail loan segment, prompting both new and current loan borrowers to pay higher EMIs. Home loans are now more expensive as a result of the benchmark interest rate increase, and the rates are often significantly higher for borrowers without salaries or those with credit scores below 750. Repo Linked Loan Rate (RLLR) and Marginal Cost of Fund Based Lending Rate (MCLR) hikes are still in progress even after a month of MPC meetings. As a consequence, it is difficult to get a home loan with cheap interest rates currently. However, let's examine the home loan rates being provided by the largest lenders in our nation.  Bank of Baroda (BoB) accepts applications for home loans from Indian residents who are at least 21 years old. Additionally, eligible are non-resident Indians (NRIs) with Indian passports, persons of Indian origin (PIOs) with foreign passports, and overseas citizens of India (OCI). The bank has set a maximum age restriction of 70 years for borrowers who want to get loans, and the maximum loan term is 30 years. The effective interest rate on home loans for non-staff members ranges from 7.45 per cent to 8.80 per cent. While the interest rate that applies to staff members (Public Scheme) is 7.45 per cent.  The minimum interest rate for home loans was raised to 7.55 per cent on June 15, 2022, by SBI, the largest lender in our nation. On the bank's website, it is stated that the lender has also raised its External Benchmark-based Lending Rate (EBLR) from 7.05 per cent to a minimum of 7.55 per cent. With effect from June 15, 2022, SBI has increased the benchmark one-year MCLR rate from 7.20 per cent to 7.40 per cent and updated the marginal cost of fund-based lending rates (MCLR) by up to 0.20 per cent.  Home loans with reasonable interest rates are available from ICICI Bank for terms of up to 30 years. Through ICICI Bank Express Home Loan, a self-service digital platform for current as well as non-ICICI Bank customers, borrowers can obtain digital approval for a home loan. With effect from June 8, 2022, ICICI Bank updated its External Benchmark Lending Rate (EBLR). ""ICICI Bank External Benchmark Lending Rate"" (I-EBLR) is referenced to RBI Policy Repo Rate with a mark-up over Repo Rate. I-EBLR is 8.60% p.a.p.m. effective June 8, 2022,"" the bank has mentioned on its website.  The marginal cost of lending rate, or MCLR, has been raised by the HDFC Bank across all tenors, and the new MCLR rates are effective as of Thursday, July 7. The overnight, one-month, and three-month HDFC Bank MCLR rates were increased by 20 basis points to 7.70%, 7.75%, and 7.80%, respectively. The HDFC Bank MCLR rates have increased by 20 bps to 7.90% and 8.05%, respectively, for tenures of six months and one year. The MCLR for HDFC Bank has increased by 20 bps to 8.15 per cent and 8.25 per cent for terms of two and three years, respectively.  Repo Linked Lending Rate (RLLR) is now 7.40 per cent with effect from September 6,2022, and One Year MCLR Rate is 7.55 per cent at PNB. The home loan interest rates are as follows.  Home loans from Axis Bank start at Rs. 3,00,000 and include a number of benefits including longer-term, appealing interest rates, a simple application procedure, doorstep service, etc. No prepayment fees as well as floating and fixed interest rates are permitted by Axis Bank for home loans. The bank provides a floating rate of 7.60 per cent to 7.95 per cent per year for salaried individuals and a fixed rate of 12 per cent for home loans. The floating rate for individuals who are self-employed ranges from 7.70 per cent to 8.05 per cent annually. and the current fixed rate for loans is 12 per cent."

However, post-expiry a sharp downside movement in the Sensex heavyweight Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) shares led to dip in the 50-stock index towards 15,500 levels. But, except oil and gas, the other sectors performed well and hence, the index recovered from the lows to end around 15,750 with a marginal loss. Asian markets struggled again on Friday following another selloff on Wall Street fueled by recession fears. European equities were steady on Friday after two days of declines as investors look ahead to a busy month of earnings amid concerns over a slowing economy. According to stock market experts, a small negative candle was formed on the daily chart with a long lower shadow. Technically, this pattern indicates the formation of the hammer-type pattern (not a classical one). Such market action signals a short-term bottom reversal pattern for the market. This could also indicate a false downside breakout of the small range at 15,700 levels. This is a positive indication, and one may expect further upside in the short term. Day trading guide for stock market today Speaking on day trading guide for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said, ""The short-term trend of Nifty continues to be range bound. But Friday's sharp upside recovery from the lows hints at the possibility of more upside for the market ahead. A sustainable upside move only above 15,900 to 15,950 levels could bring bulls back into the market and that could possibly pull the Nifty towards the next upside levels of 16,200 to 16,300 levels quickly.

Updated: 01 Jul 2022,HDFC Bank recovers some funds transferred in glitch,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/hdfc-bank-recovers-some-funds-transferred-in-glitch-11656618474014.html,"NEW DELHI : India’s largest private lender HDFC Bank Ltd is trying to collect around ₹100 crore from 4,468 customer accounts that saw money withdrawals after a technical glitch in May transferred around ₹1,000 crore into these accounts, two people aware of the development said. After the erroneous transfer that made several customers millionaires briefly, the bank swung into action by reversing the credit. However, by then, 4,515 customer accounts had withdrawn around ₹126 crore. The issue assumes significance given that HDFC Bank’s IT infrastructure had recently come under the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) scanner. In December 2020, the banking regulator barred HDFC Bank from launching new digital products and signing up new credit card customers. The card restrictions were lifted in August last year, while the digital curbs were withdrawn in March. “We have utilized this time to draw up short, medium, and long-term plans to meet the evolving digital requirements of our customers, and we will roll out these initiatives in the days to come,"" HDFC Bank said in a 12 March statement. HDFC Bank managed to recover around ₹26 crore from 47 customer accounts through means such as recall of fund transfer for those who used electronic means such as National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT), real-time gross settlement (RTGS) and Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) to transfer that money, but is still trying to recover around ₹100 crore, with some customers claiming they have already spent that money. “The issue of the said money transfer has been almost completely resolved. To put matters in context, a display error was noticed in balances of a few customer accounts post a system patch upgrade on the night of May 28/ early morning of May 29, 2022. This caused some customers of the Bank to note an erroneous balance in their account. Post the proactive detection by the Bank, the issue was remediated for all these accounts. These customers can now operate their accounts for which they are intended,"" a HDFC Bank spokesperson said in a 24 June statement to Mint. HDFC Bank is also exploring how to recover money spent through Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions at merchant establishments. Also, in order to recover the money from one HDFC Bank account, all HDFC accounts of the same customer were frozen to recoup it. Where the money was transferred to other bank accounts via third-party transfers, HDFC Bank is corresponding with those banks to get the amount reversed. Also, the fixed deposits with HDFC Bank wherein the transferred amount was parked are being recovered. “We haven’t heard of such a transfer happening in a long time. HDFC Bank is doing everything to get the money back from those who have withdrawn money. While a majority of accounts are from Tamil Nadu, there have also been instances from other parts of the country,"" said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity. As of 31 March, HDFC Bank had deposits of ₹15.6 trillion. It has 6,342 branches, with plans to double the number of branches in three years."

According to Trading Economics data, the 10-year yield of g-secs is around 7.45 %, while the 5-year yield is at 7.26% on June 30. In line with Shyamala Gopinath Committee recommendations to ensure small savings schemes are market-linked, the Finance Ministry in March 2016, had announced instead of annual resetting of small savings schemes' interest rates for the next financial year, the interest rates from now on will be reset every quarter based on the G-Sec yields of the previous three months. In 2011, the Gopinath committee had recommended keeping small savings interest rates higher by 25-100 basis points from the average yields of government securities. With the small savings schemes' interest rates kept unchanged, are they attractive compared to bank deposits that have witnessed massive hikes in their interest rates since RBI started to hike repo rate?. Since May this year, RBI has hiked the repo rate by 90 basis points - taking the rate to 4.90%. Here is the list of interest rates offered by major banks on their fixed deposits. SBI: From June 14, SBI is offering a 5.30% interest rate to regular customers on 1 year to less than 2 years tenure. The rate is 5.80% for senior citizens on the same tenure.

Nifty 50 index ended 51 points lower at 15,799 while BSE Sensex shed 150 points and closed at 53,026 levels. Nifty Bank index dipped 372 points and closed at 33,269 mark. However, despite ending in red zone, Indian stock market was among the best performers in Asian markets. According to stock market experts weakness in global markets is mainly due to growing fears that policymakers bent on dampening inflation will tip their economies into recession. They said that minor degree of positive sequence like higher tops and bottoms is intact on the daily chart and current weakness could in line with the formation of new higher bottom of the sequence. There is no confirmation of any higher bottom reversal as of now. Day trading strategy for stock market today Speaking on day trading strategy for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said, ""The short term trend of Nifty continues to be choppy with negative bias. The present range bound movement could continue for the next 1-2 sessions and immediate supports for NSE Nifty to be watched around 15,600 to 15,650 levels. On the flip side, a decisive move above 15,850 to 15,900 levels is likely to open a sustainable upside for the market."" ""The Bank Nifty index has relatively underperformed in last few sessions to the benchmark. However, the crucial support in the index is placed around the 33000 mark and if the index manages to hold this support, then a recovery could be expected in the banking space as well in the near term. On the other hand, the Nifty Midcap100 index is trading around its crucial hurdle of ’20 DEMA’ and hence one should keep a close tab on the same.

We seem to be nearing a trough in the asset-quality cycle and provisioning levels appear demonstrably sufficient. Capitalisation for sector-leading large private banks is more than adequate in our view,"" it said in a note on Indian banks. BNP Paribas thinks deposit flows have entrenched a lot of cost-stability advantages that larger banks enjoy. Valuations, while not a bargain, are not in the highest reaches of trading bands either. BNP Paribas' top stock picks - HDFC Bank: The global brokerage believes recent headwinds on tech investment news flow create a special opportunity in HDFC Bank as its traditional strengths (CASA tailwinds, best-in-class asset quality) are being somewhat discounted. Its Buy tag on HDFC Bank shares comes with a target price of ₹1,710. ICICI Bank: ICICI Bank remains a play on credit revival with high provisioning levels, tech investments and continued CASA mobilization, it said with target price of ₹890.  Axis Bank: “We choose Axis Bank for the valuation headroom it offers as well as gearing to a credit cycle recovery through both asset quality and loan growth. Our comfort with AXSB’s provision levels is as high as what we have for ICICIBC’s but recognise that a lower CASA and higher cost of funds ensure that higher rates do not confer an equal amount of competitive benefits on it as on HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank,"" the note stated. The brokerage's Buy tag on the bank stock comes with a target price of ₹970. Further, BNP Paribas also has buy ratings on IndusInd Bank (TP: ₹1,030), AU Small Finance Bank (TP: ₹750) and State Bank of India (SBI) with price target at ₹500.

Updated: 26 Jun 2022,"Bear days are numbered, build quality portfolio. These stocks are hot picks",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/bear-days-are-numbered-build-quality-portfolio-in-markets-these-stocks-are-hot-picks-11656263787991.html,"Markets recovered last week as equity benchmarks snapped a two-week losing streak as investors took a breather from inflation concerns due to the downside in commodity prices. Going forward, markets will continue to witness volatility as bearish stick still lingers with current macroeconomic risks, however, the days are numbered. The selling pressure is expected to be short-lived and experts have advised investors to build quality stocks portfolio. On Friday, Sensex finished at 52,727.98 up by 462.26 points or 0.88%. Nifty 50 closed at 15,699.25 higher by 142.60 points or 0.92%. Both the benchmarks have gained nearly 3% each from June 20 to 24. During these days, investors' wealth on BSE climbed by ₹7,40,977.89 crore. BSE market cap stood at ₹234,86,923.67 crore on June 20 and jumped to ₹242,27,901.56 crore on June 24. Research Analysts - Dharmesh Shah, Nitin Kunte, CMT, Pabitro Mukherjee, and Vinayak Parmar at ICICI Securities in their technical note said, equity benchmarks behaved contrary to our expectations as downbeat global cues tracking anxiety around rising inflation globally, rate hikes weighed on investor sentiments. On Nifty 50, they said the velocity of the decline accelerated on breach of March low of 15700 and drifted further to the 15200 mark. Going forward, the analysts said, ""We expect the index to gradually resolve higher and extend pullback towards the 16600 regions in coming months wherein strong support is placed in the vicinity of 14800-14600 zone, which we expect to hold as it is 80% retracement of CY-21 rally (13596-18604), at 14600. Thus, dips should be utilised to construct a portfolio by accumulating quality stocks in a staggered manner."" ICICI Securities analysts' positive bias is based on four factors: 1. The reading of the percentage of stocks above 200 DMA below 15 signifies extreme pessimism in the markets that eventually leads to a technical pullback to the tune of a minimum of 10% in the subsequent three months. 2. Index has already corrected 18% from the life highs and has approached oversold reading on the weekly momentum oscillator. The weekly RSI has approached its lowest level (placed at 35) since May 2020. Historically, a reading of 35 on weekly RSI has produced a decent pullback, and the analysts expect this rhythm to maintain in the coming months. 3. India continues to relatively outperform the EM basket even in the ongoing corrective phase despite significant selling by FIIs. Over the past one year, while the MSCI EM index has corrected over 40% from highs, India has relatively outperformed as the benchmark corrected only 18%. 4. The India VIX and crude oil prices have cooled off from the recent swing high. Indian Equities have an inverse correlation with the India VIX. Thus, providing impetus for the acceleration of ongoing pullback. They added, ""On the broader market front, in three instances over the past decade, intermediate correction in the Nifty Midcap, Small cap indices have been to the tune of 28% and 40%, respectively. At present, both indices have corrected 25% and 34%, respectively."" Therefore, the analysts said, ""any further correction is likely to be short-lived amid oversold territory and would set the stage for a technical pullback in coming weeks."" Here are the top picks of ICICI Securities analysts: BFSI - SBI, HDFC, Kotak Bank, Federal Bank, and Bajaj Finance. Telecom & Technology - Reliance, TCS, Infosys, L&T Infotech, HCL Technology, and Coforge. Capital goods - L&T, ABB, Siemens, BEL, AIA Engineering, ELGI Equipment, Sanghvi Movers, and Timken India. Consumption - Hindustan Unilever, Titan, ITC, Asian Paints, Tata Consumer, Havells India, Jubilant Foods, and Astral Poly. Auto - M&M, Maruti Suzuki, Ashok Leyland, Jamna Auto, Mahindra CIE, FIEM Industries, and Minda Industries. Infra and Realty - DLF LTD, Brigade Enterprise, and Phoenix Mills. Pharma & Chemicals - Divi's Laboratories, Cipla, Syngene, Torrent Pharma, and SRF Ltd. Metal - JSW Steel, Hindalco, and Graphite. Others - Adani Port, Indian Hotels, Zee Entertainment, Trent, Concor, Nocil, Balrampur Chinni, BDL, Bluedart, Dixon Technologies, Kansai Nerolac, and NRB Bearing. Markets weekly outlook: For the week June 27 to July 1, ICICI Direct analysts expect Nifty to eventually resolve past falling channel placed at 15800 and gradually head towards 16200 levels in coming weeks. In expiry week, use dips towards 15400 to create long positions as the index is poised at extreme oversold readings. ICICI Direct analysts added that brent oil prices have breached the weekly rising trend line indicating a loss of momentum and ""we expect upsides to be capped in 125-130 zone."" According to ICICI Direct analysts, amongst sectors preferences, IT, and BFSI are key sectors with favourable risk/reward, while Auto and Capital goods are expected to extend outperformance. The analysts prefer - SBI, HDFC, Kotak Bank, TCS, Maruti Suzuki, ITC, and Titan in large caps while in midcaps we like KPIT Technologies, Federal Bank, AIA Engineering, NRB Bearings, Ashok Leyland, Automotive Axles, Bharat Electronics, Havells, Trent, and Indian Hotel. Yesha Shah, Head of Equity Research, Samco Securities said, ""The coming week has a host of events arriving which could affect the mood of the market. Globally, investors will keenly analyze the US quarterly GDP growth rate numbers. The USA would officially enter into a recession if they post a negative growth and thus this could have a spill-over effect on global markets."" ""In India, the vehicle sales figures will continue to fuel stock-specific moves on D-Street as investors attempt to decipher the future trend,"" Shah added, ""Moreover, the monthly F&O expiry in the second half of the week may cause volatility in the indices. Investors are thus advised to accumulate good stocks with strong fundamentals, free cash flows, and lower leverage over the long run while disregarding short-term difficulties."""

(HDFC) and HDFC Bank, following the merger, chairman Dinesh Khara told shareholders on Wednesday. “SBI is the largest home loan provider in the country. Our home loan market share stands at 35.3% (among scheduled commercial banks); we are very mindful of HDFC-HDFC Bank merger and are taking necessary steps to counter the emerging competition,"" Khara said at the bank’s 67th annual general meeting. HDFC Bank and HDFC had announced a deal in April, to make the merged entity more competitive, and allowing access to a captive customer base to cross-sell products. The merger, expected to close in 18 months subject to regulatory and other approvals, will significantly widen its lead over private sector peers ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, in terms of total loans. Currently, HDFC Bank is in the home loan business in conjunction with HDFC. As per the arrangement, HDFC Bank sells home loans, while HDFC approves and disburses. HDFC Bank gets a sourcing fee for the transactions and has the option to purchase up to 70% of the fully-disbursed loans. As of 31 December, the merged entity‘s loan book is at ₹17.9 trillion, way ahead of ICICI Bank’s ₹8.14 trillion and Axis Bank’s ₹6.65 trillion.

Updated: 22 Jun 2022,HDFC Bank-HDFC merger: Why now? CEO explains in letter to shareholders,https://www.livemint.com/news/hdfchdfc-bank-merger-why-now-hdfc-bank-ceo-sashidhar-jagdishan-explains-in-letter-to-shareholders-11655876983104.html,"In a letter to shareholders in its annual report for 2021-22, India's private lender HDFC Bank's chief executive officer (CEO) Sashidhar Jagdishan explained the reasons and the timing of the proposed merger with housing finance company HDFC Ltd, subject to various regulatory approvals and will take effect in about 15 to 18 months. Why the merger with HDFC? ""Quite simply, this is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss. Home loans are an emotional product and bring with them a host of accelerated benefits for the Bank. Price corrections in the property market have seen inventories come down. Also, rising incomes mean that home loan EMIs have come down as a percentage of a person’s income. All this means that housing is going to be a huge growth opportunity and one of the key drivers of India’s GDP over the next decade,"" Jagdishan said. Further, only 2% of HDFC Bank's customers source their home loans through the bank, while 5% do it from other institutions. And about 70% of HDFC Ltd.’s customers do not bank with them.  “All these give us an idea about the size of the opportunity. The long tenor nature of home loans provides resiliency to the balance sheet. With the advantage of a lower cost of funds and the phenomenal distribution muscle that we have built, it is imperative that we seize this opportunity,"" he added. HDFC Bank-HDFC merger: Why now? “There have been other favourable factors too. In the last few years, the regulatory arbitrage between banks and NBFCs has come down substantially. Today reserve requirements have come down to about 22% from 26%. The increase in priority sector lending that we need to do, due to the merger, is possible now with our own increased focus on MSMEs, the affordable housing loans that we can do and the well-developed PSL certificate market. All this means that on the day of the merger there may not be any need to raise further funds to meet reserve requirements. The addition of the home mortgages portfolio on our Balance Sheet makes it more diversified and robust,"" as per Jagdishan. The enhanced capital position of the Bank post the merger also means that they can take bigger exposures in leading corporates and power the country’s infrastructure build out. The key focus area for the bank to absorb this growth opportunity is to secure enhanced liabilities to fund future growth,"" he added.  "

The RBI has hiked rates by 0.90% in two moves and is expected to do more to contain inflation. With fixed deposits acting as one of the crucial investment options, following the rate hikes by the RBI, questions were raised about trailing deposit rate increases and the propensity among banks to hike lending rates immediately but deny benefits to the depositors. While earlier this month, the RBI hiked the repo rate by 0.50% after its monetary policy meeting on June 8, taking the total hike to 0.9% in 36 days. At a time when concerns are being raised about lenders delaying deposit rate hikes amid the overall rate increases, here are the new FD interest rates for amounts less than ₹2 crore:   Additionally, Yes Bank on Tuesday introduced a product where the interest earned on a term deposit is linked to the RBI's repo rate. Till now, an external benchmark-linked rate has been popular on the lending side, but the same was not the case for deposits. The RBI has hiked rates by 0.90 per cent in two moves and is expected to do more to contain inflation. Yes Bank, in its statement, said its new offering will allow customers to enjoy dynamic returns on their fixed deposits (FDs) as the rate of interest will be linked to the prevailing repo rate. The floating rate FDs can be availed for a tenure of 1 year to less than 3 years. The lender's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Prashant Kumar said this is one of a kind product and there has been careful deliberation behind the launch aimed at enhancing its retail product offerings."

The bank has embarked on a few strategic initiatives in partnership with a new-age startups to co-create new core banking modules, the bank’s managing director Sashidhar Jagdishan told shareholders as part of the annual report. “This project will enable moving the payments module out of the existing core banking platform and help create a fully resilient active payments architecture that will ensure minimal payments downtime, even if core banking is not available,"" Jagdishan said. “This 15-month project will be followed by hollowing the customer master modules from its existing core systems and will ensure a single system of record for customers across various products,"" he said. The bank has set up a centre in Bengaluru and the team here is revamping the mobile and net banking platforms, Jagdishan said. The entire project will be completed in two years and will allow the bank to own a modern cloud-enabled mobile and net banking platform. “Enabling a new-age experience for customers, we will roll out new features every 3 to 4 weeks, in line with digital fintech companies,"" Jagdishan said. “Our entire technology and digital strategy adopts a 360-degree approach that ensures resilience and modernisation of existing legacy systems and enables new-age consumer experiences by partnering with modern neotechs,"" he said. In March, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had lifted all restrictions on the private sector lenders’ digital initiatives planned under the Digital 2.0 programme. This came after RBI had directed HDFC Bank to temporarily halt all digital launches and sourcing of credit card customers, following various outages the bank faced because of technical glitches in the past two years."

Following the merger, the CEO announced HDFC Bank's plan to double its network in the next 3-5 years. To take the initiative ahead, the bank will open up to 2,000 branches every year. Talking about the merger with HDFC, the HDFC Bank CEO said, ""We look forward to the phenomenal set of talent, deep product knowledge and expertise, the processes, and systems that HDFC Ltd will add to the Bank’s existing ones."" ""Quite simply, this is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss,"" Jagdishan added. The HDFC merger brings in robust growth opportunities for HDFC Bank in the housing loans segment. According to HDFC Bank CEO, only 2% of our customers source their home loans through us, while 5% do it from other institutions. The latter is equivalent to the size of our retail book. Home loan customers typically keep deposits that are 5 to 7 times that of other retail customers. ""And about 70% of HDFC Ltd.’s customers do not bank with us,"" the CEO said. Thereby, the CEO added, ""all these give us an idea about the size of the opportunity. The long tenor nature of home loans provides resiliency to the balance sheet."" He also said, ""we can easily bundle this with a home loan, as with every home loan, there is a propensity of a customer to take new consumer durables. It is this kind of bundling that will increase margins. With the advantage of a lower cost of funds and the phenomenal distribution muscle that we have built, it is imperative that we seize this opportunity."" Also, the enhanced capital position of the Bank post the merger, as per the CEO, means that HDFC Bank can take bigger exposures to leading corporates and power the country’s infrastructure buildout. Among the key focus area for the Bank to absorb this growth opportunity is to secure enhanced liabilities to fund future growth, as per Jagdishan. ""The branch network has been a key deposit mobilisation engine during its 27 years of growth, leading in customer acquisition, customer retention and advertising the solidity of the Bank and hence garnering liabilities by becoming the primary banking partner for our customers,"" Jagdishan said. That said, Jagdishan adds, ""Today we have 6,000+ branches across India, and we plan to nearly double our network in the next three to five years by opening 1,500 to 2,000 branches every year."" He highlighted that the branch will be digital from a customer onboarding and transaction/servicing perspective. It will provide the emotional connection and relationship management necessary for offering financial solutions to customers. Further, these branches will be small in size and will be phygital relationship centres. He said, this will enable us to go after the catchment more aggressively and build the required liability franchise that we are known for, and we are confident that we would execute well. On April 4, HDFC Bank announced that parent HDFC will merge with the bank to enable seamless delivery of home loans and leverage on the large base of over 68 million customers of HDFC Bank and inter alia improve the pace of credit growth in the economy. The proposed transaction is to create a large balance sheet and net worth that would allow a greater flow of credit into the economy. It will also enable the underwriting of larger ticket loans, including infrastructure loans, an urgent need of the country. The merger is expected to be achieved within 18 months subject to completion of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions."

Updated: 20 Jun 2022,HDFC vs ICICI vs IndusInd vs RBL Vs Kotak vs Yes Bank: Check RD Rates,https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/hdfc-vs-icici-vs-indusind-vs-rbl-vs-kotak-vs-yes-bank-check-rd-rates-11655716739822.html,"A recurring deposit (RD) is a type of debt investment that allows individuals to set up a fund for their own finances on a regular basis. Unlike a fixed deposit, which requires a lump-sum deposit to create an account, an RD allows you to invest on a monthly basis, similar to a mutual fund SIP, and receive interest rates that are comparable to fixed deposits. You can not only earn good returns on your RD by making monthly deposits, but you can also manage your emergency fund more effectively by not parking a lump sum amount at once. RD, like other deposit products, is insured by DICGC up to ₹5 lakhs, minimizing deposit security risk to almost zero. Because interest rates are rising, now is the ideal time to create an RD account. Here are the banks that have raised their recurring deposit interest rates promptly after the RBI raised the repo rate to 4.90 per cent.  On 17th June 2022, HDFC Bank made interest rate revisions on RDs across selected tenors. The bank is now offering a maximum interest rate of 5.75% to regular customers and 6.50% to senior citizens on recurring deposits.  ICICI Bank allows RD for a tenure ranging from 6 months to 10 years. On 16th June 2022, ICICI Bank revised interest rates on recurring deposits and now offers a maximum interest rate of 5.75% to non-senior citizens and 6.50% to senior citizens.

On 1st June 2022, the bank revised interest rates on recurring deposits following which the general public will now get a maximum rate of 6.50% and senior citizens will get a maximum return of 7%.

On RDs maturing in 24 months to less than 36 months, RBL Bank offers a maximum regular rate of 6.50% and 7% to senior citizens.  Kotak Mahindra Bank allows recurring deposits for a tenure ranging from 6 months to 10 years.

Nifty 50 index dipped 331 points and closed at 15,360 levels while BSE Sensex crashed 1045 points and closed at 51,495 mark. Nifty Bank index ended 721 points lower at 32,617 levels. BSE small-cap and mid-cap indices fell 2.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively, under-performing the Nifty. Global stock markets fell Thursday as fears of a recession grew after the Federal Reserve's biggest rate hike in nearly three decades and the Swiss National Bank raised its policy interest rate for the first time in 15 years in a surprise move on Thursday. According to stock market experts, a long bear candle was formed on the daily chart after opening higher. This candle has broken decisively below the important support band of 15,700 to 15,600 levels and closed lower. This downside breakout of the support could hint more downside for the market ahead and any upside bounce from here could be a sell on rise opportunity. Day trading guide for stock market today Speaking on day trading guide for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said, ""The sharp weakness of Thursday below the crucial support of 15,600 levels indicate significant downside breakout in the market. One may expect Nifty to slide down to the next lows of around 15,000 to 14,800 in the near term. Any upside bounce from here could be a sell on rise opportunity."" Expecting pullback from short term support levels, Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com said, ""The momentum readings on the lower time frame chart has reached the oversold zone and hence, a pullback move could be seen from the short term supports in the near term. But until there’s change in data or the structure, the trend remains bearish. The immediate supports for Nifty are placed around 15,270 and 15,080 and because the readings on lower time chart are oversold, a pullback can be seen from these levels. On pullback moves, 15,650 to 15,800 will be seen as immediate resistance zone.""

The domestic equities also tracked global woes as investors betted cautiously ahead of US Fed and European Central Bank policy. Following this, more than ₹5.16 lakh crore of investors' wealth has been wiped out from Dalal Street. Nearly half of the total losses were seen in the top -10 most valued companies.

Furthermore, Shah added, ""statistics on India's trade balance will be closely monitored as this statistic clocked a record high in May 2022. The movement of rupee against the dollar will also be kept an eye on.

Updated: 12 Jun 2022,Why investors aren’t buying into HDFC Bank CEO Jagdishan’s optimism,https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/why-investors-aren-t-buying-into-hdfc-bank-ceo-jagdishan-s-optimism-11655029931007.html,"NEW DELHI: Braggadocio, normally the exclusive preserve of motor-mouth politicians, seems to have infected some of the country’s leading bankers over the past few years as well. The latest example of self-aggrandizing emanates, surprisingly, from an institution that has built its reputation on the back of prudent risk management and effective investments in systems and processes. In an interaction with analysts, Sashidhar Jagdishan, MD and CEO of HDFC Bank, waxed eloquent about future business prospects, adding almost breathlessly that the bank’s merger with parent HDFC Ltd will double profits in the next five years. And then, somewhat as an afterthought, he also added that liabilities growth could be a problem. It might serve to untangle both the thoughts. The HDFC Bank merger with its parent HDFC Ltd – which will take another 12-15 months to complete, provided all the regulatory approvals are in hand – is likely to produce a behemoth in the financial services industry. If the two had merged at the end of March 2022, the combined entity would have impressive numbers – a capital base of ₹360,344 crore, a balance sheet size of ₹27,10,000 crore and net profits upwards of $6 billion, or over ₹50,000 crore. If we look at net profit alone, it is a lot of money with the capability to add extra juice to the balance sheet. Jagdishan claimed to analysts that this level of net profit could easily double to $14-15 billion over the next five years, indicating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of slightly over 20% every year. To be fair, he is justified in using this projection: HDFC Bank’s net profits have grown at a CAGR of 20.5% over the past five years. It might be instructive to remind him of the cautionary note crafted by market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India: past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance. This is where hubris overtakes restraint. Three points stand out. One, Jagdishan’s prospect of gang-buster growth is predicated on the pending merger with parent HDFC Ltd and the economy growing by 7-8% every year. The GDP prospect looks uncertain in view of the Russia-Ukraine conflict exacerbating the economic slowdown inflicted by the pandemic. The World Bank’s latest edition of the Global Economic Prospects report also issues dire warnings about stagflation threatening the world economy. In such a situation, the claim that any financial institution will be able to grow its balance sheet by over 14-15% every year, or achieve a CAGR of over 20% in net profits, over the next 5-7 years seems slightly foolhardy. Second, there has to be some realistic assessment of what the merger brings to the table. Is it good in general and should they go through with it? Of course, the merger is undoubtedly desirable in terms of synergies and efficiencies. But, will it comprehensively alter the game for HDFC Bank, creating a step-change in its fortunes? The jury is out on that one. Here is why. At its core, HDFC Ltd is an over-grown, oversized housing finance company. It has no other financial products in its portfolio. It is reaching the limits of its growth potential. This is despite the Indian mortgage market having adequate headroom for future growth. The core problem is funding and HDFC’s increasing reliance on market borrowings – 65% from debentures, securities and term loans; 32% from public deposits – limits the company’s ability to extract higher yields. Hence, merger with a bank gives the mortgage business access to cheaper funds. But, at the same time, a critical factor for HDFC Bank will be deciding what percentage of the asset book should comprise mortgage business to enable the bank to achieve a healthy blended yield on its mix of assets. The efficiency of capital allocation will be the key deciding factor here. Using the principle of ceteris paribus, or assuming that all other things are remaining constant, the post-merger mortgage book is likely to be around 30% of the total asset book, give or take. Even assuming that the mortgage book is maintained at a constant 30% of the overall asset book, which is expected to grow upwards of 15% annually, it will still require HDFC Bank to consistently divert additional money from its other businesses to maintain the mortgage book at this steady state. The question then is: will it be worthwhile for the bank and its shareholders? Finally, the point about liabilities, which is banker-speak for deposits. This is supposed to be the secret sauce behind the merger, a key raison d’etre, and Jagdishan is already expressing doubts about this. Even before the game has begun. Commercial banks with wide branch networks have access to current accounts and savings accounts (CASA), which are low-cost liabilities; in addition, due to marginal fluctuations in volumes, they are considered almost akin to perpetual liabilities, making the task of asset-liability management easier. In contrast, most time deposits – better known as fixed deposits – have a maximum maturity of only 5 years while housing loans are typically between 15 and 20 years, thereby leading to potentially adverse maturity mismatches. Which is why, on the face of it, HDFC Bank’s CASA deposits at over 48% of its total deposits look attractive. The problem is that much of this is already spoken for. To feed the ravenous mortgage business, Jagdishan will need to aggressively source additional liabilities. Two problems arise here. HDFC Bank has been hitting a wall on digitization; it has not been able to compete with peers in using the digital platform to extract additional efficiencies. The sprawling institution has become exceedingly bureaucratic and needs a deep organizational reset if it is to compete with its peers or the newly consolidated public sector banks. Digitization will be key to reducing liability origination and administrative costs. The other problem lies in Jagdishan claiming to analysts that he plans to add 1,500-2,000 new branches every year. Going by the reports of the conference in newspapers, it is surprising that none of the analysts challenged Jagdishan on this. HDFC Bank already has 6,300 branches and opening another 2,000 branches is adding over 30% capacity in one year. This is a huge capital investment, which will leave the bank with reduced funds to pursue additional businesses or chase incremental revenues. That then puts the whole assumption of 20% CAGR for net profit under a cloud. The market has consistently hammered down the prices of both HDFC Ltd and HDFC Bank ever since the merger was announced. Both the stocks have lost close to 19% of their value since 4 April 2022, the day the respective boards approved the merger. The continuing conflict in Europe, heightened commodity prices, an impending economic slowdown and a general environment of uncertainty have a definite role to play in the value erosion. But when viewed against the BSE 30-stock Sensitive Index (which has lost only 10.5% during this period), or against the S&P BSE Bankex (which has fallen by 9.7%), it is evident that a class of investors is antsy about the merger. Jagdishan should be talking to these guys, trying to find out what haunts them and perhaps craft a clearer communication strategy to address specific concerns. Exaggerated claims, in the style of bombastic politicians, are unlikely to sway hard-nosed investors."
Updated: 12 Jun 2022,HDFC Bank shares an important alert regarding PAN card update: Check what’s that,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/hdfc-bank-shares-an-important-alert-regarding-pan-card-update-check-what-s-that-11655020377378.html,"The Permanent Account Number (PAN) is a ten-digit unique alphanumeric number provided by the Income Tax Department in the form of a plastic card. This PAN Card is necessary for all individuals since it is one of the most important documents for financial transactions and filing income tax returns. To apply for a new PAN Card or update an existing one, a person can visit the Income Tax portal, UTI Infrastructure Technology and Services Limited (UTIITSL), and National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL), or PAN Service Centers and TIN Facilitation Centers. However, in this day and age of increasing fraud, fraudsters will send a bogus SMS to a customer's mobile number requesting to update their PAN, to unblock their blocked account and the customer will fall prey to the hoax by doing so. As a precautionary step, India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank has warned customers to not click on unknown links asking to update PAN details. HDFC Bank has recently said via a Tweet that “#GoDigitalGoSecure and never click on unknown links asking you to update your PAN card details."" Customers of HDFC Bank should always remember that the bank never asks you to share your confidential details via SMS or call. Not only HDFC, but every bank and financial institution never request their customers to share their personal account details. What they do is, send SMS via the official number having an official website of the bank linked in the SMS, which customers should and should keep in mind always. In the case of HDFC Bank customers will get SMS from the official number 186161 or ID HDFCBK/HDFCBN. And links within the SMS will always be from the official domain hdfcbk.io As a result, what the bank is warning is customers should not click on the unknown links they get via SMS asking to share confidential details, and they should do the same task over a call if they get a call from an unknown number representing as a banking official to share bank account details. If they get any fake SMS or call they should immediately report it to the bank or they can also visit National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal to file their complaint regarding cyber fraud. Individuals can read the BE(A)WARE - Be Aware and Beware! booklet issued by the RBI Ombudsmen for further guidance on how to take additional measures when conducting financial transactions. "

On the other hand, Reliance Industries, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, Godrej Properties, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Larsen & Toubro are its top Indian stock picks which are part of the Asia ex-Japan long-only thematic equity portfolio. “As for the Indian stock market, it continues to be held up by domestic flows while foreigners keep selling. Domestic equity mutual funds have recorded net inflows of $19 bn in the first five months of 2022, while foreigners have sold a net $23.4 bn of Indian equities year-to-date. The risk in the domestic flows is that about half was accounted for by retail investors investing directly last fiscal year, as opposed to into funds,"" he highlighted. In another note last month, Jefferies' Chris Wood had said that Greed & fear continues to believe that this is a year where investors should accumulate their favourite Indian stocks on weakness in what remains Asia’s best long-term structural story in terms of equities."

Updated: 09 Jun 2022,"Petrol, diesel prices have room to rise ahead. How does it impact inflation",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/petrol-diesel-prices-have-room-to-rise-ahead-how-does-it-impact-inflation-11654795717212.html,"Fuel prices in India have remained unchanged for the eighteenth straight day on Thursday. Recently, the government has given relief by trimming excise duty on petrol and diesel which has led to stability in the prices. However, there is still some room for fuel prices to rise ahead and they will play a role in pushing inflation higher. On June 9, petrol per litre is available at ₹96.72 in the national capital, while the price is at ₹106.03 in Kolkata, ₹111.35 in Mumbai, and ₹102.63 in Chennai. Further, a litre of diesel is available at ₹89.62 in Delhi, the price was ₹92.76 in Kolkata, ₹97.28 in Mumbai, and ₹94.24 in Chennai. As per Goodreturns, among metro cities, petrol is highest in Mumbai, meanwhile, diesel is costliest in Hyderabad. Last month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman reduced excise duty on petrol by ₹8 per litre and diesel by ₹6 per litre. Oil marketing companies (OMCs) BPCL, HPCL, and Indian Oil revise fuel prices on a daily basis taking into consideration international crude prices, excise duty, Value Added Tax (VAT), dealer commission, and freight charges. In its latest treasury research note, HDFC Bank expects CPI inflation at 6.9% in May this year. The bank expects inflation to stay above RBI's upper target of 6% till December-end. However, the bank expects inflation to be 4.7% by March 2023-end. HDFC Bank stated that they expect CPI Inflation to average at 7.3% in H1 FY23 and ease to 6.2% in H2 FY23 assuming crude oil prices average at $105 per barrel in FY23. For the full FY23, CPI inflation is expected to average in the range of 6.5-6.7%, assuming a normal monsoon, some moderation in global commodity prices in H2, and elevated services inflation. ""Our forecasts also consider recently announced excise duty cuts on petrol and diesel, although we assume that these could be partially offset by some pass-through of high crude oil prices to pump prices by Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) to cover up their under-recoveries,"" HDFC Bank's report said. As per HDFC Bank's note, under-recoveries for petrol and diesel stood at ₹17 per litre and ₹20 per litre respectively as of 2nd June 2022, warranting a case for hiking petrol and diesel prices going forward. Further, HDFC Bank's treasury report points out that a 50% pass-through of these under-recoveries could mean 30 basis points increase in inflation while a 100% pass-through could imply a 55-60 basis points increase in headline inflation. For now, HDFC Bank assumes a pass-through lower than the 50% scenario. India's consumer price index (CPI) inflation has reached an eight-year high of 7.79% in April 2022. Food inflation skyrocketed to 8.38% in the month. This would be the fourth consecutive month where inflation has stayed above RBI's comfort zone. In its bi-monthly monetary policy on Wednesday, RBI hiked the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.9%. RBI also remained focused on the withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward while supporting growth. ""International crude oil prices, however, remain elevated, with risks of further pass-through to domestic pump prices,"" RBI said in its June 2022 policy. On the assumption of a normal monsoon in 2022 and an average crude oil price (Indian basket) of $105 per barrel, RBI raised its inflation target to 6.7% in 2022-23, with inflation in Q1 at 7.5%; Q2 at 7.4%; Q3 at 6.2%; and Q4 at 5.8%, with risks evenly balanced. Post-RBI policy, Abheek Barua, Chief Economist, HDFC Bank said, ""The central bank seemed far more concerned about inflation --- reflected in its upward revision in its inflation forecast by 100bps to 6.7%—and relatively more sanguine on domestic growth impulses."" ""Clearly the RBI is concerned about the broad-based nature of the increase in inflation and the risk of the second-round impact on inflation expectations. Therefore, the policy rate is likely to be raised well beyond the pre-pandemic level, close to 6% by fiscal year-end,"" Barua added. The Indian government will be announcing CPI Inflation data for May 2022, next week on June 13."
