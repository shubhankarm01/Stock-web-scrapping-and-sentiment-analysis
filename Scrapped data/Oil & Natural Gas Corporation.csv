Updated: 03 Jul 2022,Windfall tax to regain the ₹1 lakh crore revenue lost in excise cuts: Report,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/windfall-tax-by-govt-to-regain-most-of-rs-1-lakh-crore-revenue-lost-in-excise-cuts-sources-11656826873556.html,"The windfall tax on oil produced within India and fuel exported overseas will make up for more than three-fourths of the revenue that the government lost when it cut excise duty on petrol and diesel to cool soaring inflation, according to news agency PTI report citing industry sources said. This development comes following India joining on July 1 a select group of countries that began taxing windfall gains accruing to oil companies from soaring energy prices. What is windfall tax? A windfall tax is a type of one-off tax on companies that have seen their profits increase extraordinarily based on favorable market conditions. The government has imposed a ₹6 per litre tax on the export of petrol and jet fuel (ATF) and ₹13 a litre on the export of diesel effective July 1. A ₹23,250 per tonne tax was levied on crude oil produced domestically. Meanwhile, two sources with knowledge of the calculations said, the tax on crude oil producers like Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Oil India Ltd and Vedanta Ltd alone will fetch the government ₹69,000 crore annually considering 29.7 million tonnes of oil production in 2021-22 fiscal (April 2021 to March 2022), . Notably, for the remaining nine months of the current fiscal, the levy would get the government almost ₹52,000 crore if the tax remains in place till March 31, 2023.On top of this, the new tax brought in on the export of petrol, diesel and ATF would bring in additional revenue. According to one of the sources, ""India exported 2.5 million tonnes of petrol, 5.7 million tonnes of diesel and 797,000 tonnes of ATF during April and May. Even if these volumes fall to a third due to the new levy and other restrictions imposed, the government would still be richer by at least ₹20,000 crore if the tax continues till March 2023."" Reliance Industries Ltd operates a 35.2 million tonnes a year only-for-exports oil refinery at Jamnagar in Gujarat and that refinery is expected to continue overseas shipments even with the new tax, the second source said. Some exports are also expected from the firm's adjoining 33 million tonnes a year refinery that is meant to cater to the domestic market. ""Reliance has a fuel retailing joint venture with BP and that joint venture operates 1,459 out of 83,423 petrol pumps in the country. Even after meeting the full requirement of the 1,459 petrol pumps and selling some fuel to PSU retailers, it still would be left with exportable surplus"" the source said. Similarly, Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy operates a 20 million tonnes a year refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat. It has 6,619 petrol pumps whose full requirement would be less than about 12 million tonnes of petrol, diesel and ATF that the refinery produces annually. The two taxes together will accrue as much as ₹72,000 crore or over 85 per cent of the revenue that the government lost from cutting excise duty on petrol and diesel, sources said.

Updated: 01 Jul 2022,"RIL, ONGC shares crash after govt hikes export tax on petrol, diesel",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/govt-hikes-export-tax-on-petrol-diesel-and-atfs-ril-shares-see-sharp-fall-11656651138911.html,"The government on Friday announced an increase in taxes on the export of petrol, diesel, and aviation turbine fuel (ATF). The centre has also mandated exporters to meet the requirements of the domestic market first. The government has levied a ₹6 per litre tax on exports of petrol and ATF and ₹13 per litre on exports of diesel. The government has also announced taxes on windfall gains made by crude oil producers. The government also slapped a ₹23,230 per tonne additional tax on domestically produced crude oil to take away windfall gains accruing to producers from high international oil prices, a separate government notification showed. Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) witnessed a sharp fall after the export tax hike announcement. RIL shares plunged more than 5%, its biggest decline in about 18 months, whereas ONGC shares tanked 10% in Friday's early deals, while BSE Sensex was down nearly a per cent. “Reliance is witnessing a sharp fall after the Government has levied taxes on windfall gains made by domestic refineries. Earlier Reliance was firing on all cylinders but now there is a break in its refinery business as the commodity cycle is also reversing however other verticals have strong growth potential,"" said Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart Ltd. Fuels from Mukesh Ambani-led RIL's Jamnagar refinery are exported to several countries across the world.  Gasoline exporters have been asked to give a self declaration that 50% of the quantity mentioned in the shipping bill has been or will be supplied to the domestic market during the current financial year. The tax on exports follows oil refiners, particularly the private sector, reaping huge gains from exporting fuel to markets such as Europe and the US. The tax on domestically produced crude oil follows local producers reaping windfall gains from the surge in international oil prices.  Domestic petrol and diesel prices have been steady since May when the government announced a cut in excise duty on petrol by 8 per litre, and 6 rupees per litre on diesel on May 21, 2022. The domestic fuel prices are likely to remain low as the taxes announced today by the government do not impact them."

Also, the ministry has also proposed appointment for a period of three years from the date of joining instead of the present five-year term. The selection for the top post will be done through a three-member search-cum-selection committee headed by PESB chairman and composed of oil secretary and former Indian Oil chairman B Ashok. Earlier on 4 February, the panel was formed, but the terms of reference are being framed only now. ""Keeping in view the strategic importance and vision for the company and its future, the board did not recommend any candidate and decided to constitute a search committee,"" the ministry letter said referring to PESB's interviews on 5 June, 2021.

With Shashi Shanker's retirement, director for finance and senior most director on ONGC board -- Subhash Kumar -- was given the additional charge of chairman and managing director. When he retired on 3 December, 2021, ONGC's Director for Human Resources -- Alka Mittal -- was given additional charge. She will superannuate in August.

According to the company's regulatory filing, standalone net profit was ₹8,859.54 crore, or ₹7.04 per share, in January-March, compared to ₹6,733.97 crore, or ₹5.35 per share, in the same period a year ago. From ₹21,188.91 crore in January-March 2021 to ₹34,497.24 crore in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2021-22, revenue from operations increased to ₹34,497.24 crore. ONGC reported a record net profit of ₹40,305.74 crore for the full fiscal year (April 2021 to March 2022), up from ₹11,246.44 crore the previous year. This comes after international energy costs began to rise in late 2021 and peaked in February after Russia invaded Ukraine. ONGC receives international pricing for the crude oil it produces, hence the rise in energy prices benefited it. ONGC gets international rates as the downstream fuel retailers too price petrol, diesel and other petroleum products at global rates. Consolidated net profit, after including those earned by its subsidiaries like HPCL and ONGC Videsh Ltd, soared to ₹12,061.44 crore in March quarter and ₹49,294.06 crore in the full fiscal 2021-22.

Updated: 19 Dec 2021,ONGC subsidiary OPaL reports first-ever profit of ₹18 cr during April-Sept,https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/ongc-subsidiary-opal-reports-first-ever-profit-of-rs-18-cr-during-aprilsept-11639912387122.html,"NEW DELHI : India's top oil and gas producer ONGC has scripted a sharp turnaround in fortunes of its subsidiaries with its petrochemical unit reporting its first ever profit, a top official said.  ONGC Petro additions Ltd (OPaL), the venture ONGC floated for downward integration and expansion into petrochemical field by utilizing its naphtha stream from Hazira and Uran and C2+ components from imported LNG, has been steadily seeing operational profit or EBITDA improvement since 2016-17 but the lopsided capital structure with high-debt servicing cost and high depreciation during the initial period of capitalisation led to incurring net losses.  ""During the first half of the current fiscal (April to September), OPaL made a profit after tax of ₹18 crore,"" ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Subhash Kumar said.  Kumar, who pivoted the turnaround story with his finance background, said OPaL is in the process of exiting from the SEZ which would improve the profitability by ₹800 crore per annum and about ₹600 crore of more profits will be added if the government were to approve a proposal for the company becoming a unit of ONGC or is merged with it.  Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) during 2002 to 2006 conceptualized several joint ventures to diversify in other than exploration and production (E&P) business with an objective of value addition, downstream integration and monetisation of its own stranded gas assets.  These projects - OPaL, ONGC Mangalore Petrochemicals Ltd (OMPL) and ONGC Tripura Power Company (OTPC) were successfully implemented and are now operating at full capacity.  ONGC as promoter played lead role in selection of LSTK/PMC contractors, execution of various feedstock and off-take agreements, resolution of various complex techno- commercial, regulatory and taxation issues crept during execution and commissioning of these projects.  Besides resolving operational, financial and regulatory issues, it let the joint ventures be headed by professional domain expert best from the industry.  Kumar said as per ONGC 2040 Strategy, going forward 70 per cent revenue is expected from refinery and petrochemical business and 10 per cent profit will be contributed from non-oil and gas sector, and so the role of these non-E&P JVs will continue to play a crucial role in the Group.  ONGC holds 49.36 per cent stake in the 1.1 million tons per annum capacity OPaL, GAIL has 49.21 per cent and GSPC the remaining 1.43 per cent.  ""ONGC has played a crucial role in OPaL's turnaround story starting from support during construction phase, its stabilization and continuous supply of feed stock from its plant which is crucial to the profitability of any petrochemical venture.  In addition to an equity contribution of ₹998 crore, ONGC has also subscribed to share warrants issued by OPaL amounting to ₹3,451 crore,"" he said.  The firm also single handedly backstopped ₹7,778 crore CCDs and provided comfort letters amounting to ₹9,500 crore for the loans, he said.  OTPC, in which ONGC holds 50% stake, set up a 726.6 MW gas-based power plant in Tripura. The plant started operation in March 2014. Kumar said OTPC is a classic case of an efficiently managed entity.  During the project phase in order to avoid delays, entire oversized cargo (ODC) was routed through Bangladesh.  Plant has been generating profit since inception and is one of a few gas based companies paying dividends. OTPC caters to about 30% of electricity requirement of the entire North Eastern region at a competitive tariff.  It is the anchor customer for offtake of ONGC's gas from Tripura, off-taking about 60% of total gas production and thus utilizing the stranded gas in the region unlocking the value of ₹700 crore per annum.  With these investments, the state of Tripura has become power surplus from power deficient state, enabling exporting electricity to Bangladesh.  Till date with an equity investment of ₹560 crore, ONGC has received about ₹310 crore as dividend and ₹106 crore premium on sale of residual equity to GIP in 2015. Petronet MHB Ltd is another classic turn around story where ONGC as a promoter played a crucial role in turning a loss making entity to a profit making dividend paying entity.  With continuous guidance at Board level and effective management the company is consistently making profits even during the Pandemic period. ONGC has earned a total dividend of ₹208 crore out of total investment of ₹274 crore.  In case of OMPL, the standalone petchem unit was subject to low spreads due to cyclic nature due to supply/demand dynamics in the region.  To tide over this, ONGC has initiated a merger of the company with its refinery subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL).  ""ONGCs presence across the value chain and beyond the E&P business is also an effective way to mitigate risk. ONGC Group is able to better shield itself from volatile crude markets as the combined entity will have exposure across commodity cycles,"" he said.  The company had acquired the government's 51.11% equity stake in HPCL to expand its presence into midstream and downstream sectors. ""Going forward, ONGC's major stake in HPCL and MRPL will become the dominant driving factor for maximizing the shareholding value,"" he added.

This comes against the backdrop of state run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) being in talks with PJSC SIBUR Holding for a partnership to set up a large petrochemical facility in India as reported by Mint earlier. IOC is focussing on the expansion of its petrochemical business against the backdrop of a growing demand for petrochemicals in the country. “Strengthening cooperation in petrochemical sector,"" Puri said in a tweet on Friday. ""Met Dmitry Konov, chairman of management board of Sibur (Holding) to discuss investments into India,"" he added in another tweet. IOC, the country’s largest fuel retailer and refiner plans to invest ₹1 trillion over the next four to five years as it plans to add another 25 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to its current capacity of 80.2 mtpa. IOC, which expects India’s diesel demand to reach pre Covid-19 levels by Diwali this year, has a 32% share of the domestic market. This assumes importance given that energy consumption, especially electricity and refinery products, is usually linked to overall demand in the economy. Mint had earlier reported about India and Russia working on a multi-pronged approach that involves joint collaboration in petrochemicals along with energy sourcing and supplies, and upstream investments in Russia and India. India has been leaning on its old energy partner Russia as part of the strategy of diversifying its energy basket with crude oil supplies from non-Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) sources. India signed the first term contract for crude oil sourcing from Russia in February last year, with IOC and Russian oil company Rosneft inking the agreement for 2 million metric tonnes (mmt) of Urals grade crude.

The hydrocarbon exploration major’s gross revenue for the April-June quarter was up by 77% to Rs23,022 crore due to higher crude oil price realisation, as compared to Rs13,011 crore gross revenue earned in the corresponding period of the last financial year. Following the covid outbreak, crude prices for Indian basket of crude had plunged to $19.90 in April last year during the first coronavirus pandemic wave before recovering to 73.54 a barrel in July, data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell showed. The demand since then has come back, with the net realization for ONGC in Q1 being $65.59 per barrel from nominated fields, as compared to $28.87 per barrel in the first quarter of 2020-21. The net realization was $66.86 per barrel from joint venture acreages. On a consolidated basis, ONGC registered a net profit of Rs6,847 crore on a gross revenue of Rs1.08 trillion in the first quarter this fiscal. ONGC has been trying to increase production at a time when the country’ domestic crude and oil and gas production have been faltering. India’s oil and gas production fell by 5.22% and 8.06% respectively during April 2020 to March 2021, as compared to the corresponding period in the previous financial year. This comes in the backdrop of India, the world’s third-largest oil importer witnessing an upward trajectory of transportation fuel prices. Diesel and petrol prices are at a record high and have already breached the ₹100 mark."

However, according to the monthly production report released by ministry of petroleum and natural gas, there was an 19.52% uptick in gas production in June. India’s domestic energy production has been low. In what doesn’t bode well for the country’s energy security, India’s crude and oil and gas production fell by 5.22% and 8.06%, respectively, in the last financial year. “Crude oil production during June 2021 was 2,481.66 TMT (thousand metric tonnes), which is 2.26% lower than target for the month and 1.79% lower when compared with production of June 2020. Cumulative crude oil production during April-June 2021 was 7,412.87 TMT, which is 2.24% and 3.42% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively,"" the report said. This production dip also comes at a time of transportation fuel prices being at an all-time high. “Natural gas production during June 2021 was 2,777.43 MMSCM (million metric standard cubic metres), which is 19.52% higher when compared with production of June 2020 but 5.26% lower than the monthly target.

Updated: 13 May 2021,ONGC removes marketing margin but refuses to lower gas price,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ongc-removes-marketing-margin-but-refuses-to-lower-gas-price-11620895854155.html,"State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has agreed to do away with charging users a marketing margin on the gas it plans to produce from its KG basin field but refused to lower the minimum rate, according to tender documents. ONGC, India's top oil and gas producer, last month sought bids for sale of initial 2 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from its KG-DWN-98/2 block (KG-D5). The company asked bidders to quote a rate linked to prevailing Brent crude oil prices. It fixed the floor or minimum rate at 10.5 per cent of the three-month average Brent crude oil price. On top of it, the firm sought USD 0.20 per million British thermal unit. Potential bidders however opposed the levy of the marketing margin as well as the ""high"" floor price. Responding to queries raised by bidders, ONGC said the floor price cannot be changed but marketing margin is being dropped. ""Change in Reserve Gas Price (floor rate) is not agreed. However, considering requests from various bidders, the levy of marketing margin of USD 0.20 per mmBtu over and above contract price is removed,"" it said. At the current Brent crude oil price of close to USD 70, the minimum price comes to USD 7.3 per million British thermal unit. This price, however, will be subject to the ceiling or cap fixed by the government for deepsea fields every six months. The cap for six months beginning April 1 is USD 3.62 per mmBtu. This essentially means that bidders may corner gas by offering to pay USD 7, but the buyers will have to pay no more than the ceiling price of USD 3.62. ONGC in the tender offered to sell 2 mmscmd of gas for a duration of 3 to 5 years at Odalarevu in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, which is connected to state gas utility GAIL's KG basin pipeline network as well as PIL's East West Pipeline which is connected to KG basin network and further to Gujarat gas grid. ""Bidder is required to quote 'P', which would be the slope to Dated Brent Price. This slope should be more than or equal to 10.5 per cent,"" the tender document said adding that 'P' can be made in the increment of 0.1 per cent."" Gas price (in USD per mmBtu) ""shall be the lower of the quoted slope (per cent) * Dated Brent Price or notified ceiling price during the period,"" it said. The auction is to be conducted next week. In pre-bid meetings, bidders raised the issue of high reserve price. Bid prices starting from 10.5 per cent of dated Brent price must be revised downwards so as to account for cheaper alternatives available from other LNG terminals, according to a bidder query posted on the ONGC tender document. Another bidder said, ""Regarding the pricing formula, it is of our view that the starting slope to dated Brent price at 10.5 per cent is quite a higher side. Crude oil demand is going to recover this year and it is going to increase in short. In other domestic gas tenders from KG-D6 (2 years back) was also linkage with brend however the slope was very low ie 8.5 per cent."" ""Also our gas consumption points are in western and northern part of India and the location of the gas field on eastern side also adds up transportation cost of multiple transporters. Considering the above factors, we request for a reduction in slope."" Yet another bidder said, in view of outcomes of the recent domestic auctions, and further in consideration of the higher transportation costs in evacuating gas to west and north India, request is that the reserve gas price be changed to 9.5 per cent of Dated Brent Price. ""In the current global/local gas market scenarios with improved market priced domestic gas availability, spot LNG with endless flexibilities matching specific requirements of customers, uncertainty of demand and affordability of small scale manufacturing sector, proposed Reserve Gas Price of 10.5 per cent is not reflective of current market reality,"" another bidder said. ""Also, in the instant case, considering marketing margin of USD 0.20 per mmBtu on GCV basis plus ₹16.14 transportation tariff of KG basin pipeline network up to PIL interconnect point, the Reserve Gas Price works out to be more than 11 per cent. In view of above, ONGC is requested to consider pragmatic gas reserve gas price of 8.5 per cent offering win-win proposition to ONGC and prospective bidders,"" the bidder added. In the bid document, ONGC said the marketing margin was to cover the cost of marketing and it does not form a part of the ceiling gas price. Gas supplies from the block, which sits next to Reliance Industries Ltd's KG-D6 block in Bay of Bengal, is to start from end-June. Earlier this month, Reliance Industries Ltd and its partner BP Plc of UK sold 5.5 mmscmd of additional natural gas from KG-D6 at a rate linked to Platts JKM (Japan Korea marker) - the liquefied natural gas (LNG) benchmark price assessment for spot physical cargoes. The lowest bid that can be placed is JKM minus USD 0.3 per million British thermal unit. The highest acceptable bid would be JKM plus USD 2.01 per mmBtu. This is the same benchmark RIL-BP had used in February to sell out 7.5 mmscmd of gas from the block. ONGC's KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block is expected to have a peak production rate of 15.25 mmscmd of natural gas and 80,000 barrels per day of oil. The company is likely to come out with another tender later this year for the sale of 5 mmscmd of gas from next year. PTI ANZ ANU ANU"
Updated: 25 Apr 2021,"Oil ministry tells ONGC to sell oilfields; hive off drilling, other services",https://www.livemint.com/politics/policy/oil-ministry-tells-ongc-to-sell-oilfields-hive-off-drilling-other-services-11619347536058.html,"NEW DELHI : The petroleum ministry has told India's largest oil and gas producer ONGC to sell stake in producing oil fields such as to Ratna R-Series to private firms, get foreign partners in KG basin gas fields, monetise existing infrastructure, and hive off drilling and other services into a separate firm to raise production. Amar Nath, additional secretary (exploration) in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, on April 1 wrote to Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Chairman and Managing Director Subhash Kumar giving a seven-point action plan, 'ONGC Way Forward' that would help the firm raise oil and gas production by one-third by 2023-24. The action plan, reviewed by PTI, calls on ONGC to consider sale of stake in maturing fields such as Panna-Mukta and Ratna and R-Series in western offshore and onshore fields like Gandhar in Gujarat to private firms while divesting/privatising 'non-performing' marginal fields. It wanted ONGC to bring in global players in gas-rich block KG-DWN-98/2 where output is slated to rise sharply by next year, and the recently brought into production Ashokenagar block in West Bengal. Also identified for the purpose is the Deendayal block in the KG basin which the firm had bought from Gujarat government firm GSPC a couple of years back. The ministry also wants the company to explore creating separate entities for drilling, well services, logging, workover services and data processing entities. This is the third attempt by the oil ministry to get ONGC to privatise its oil and gas fields under the Modi government. In October 2017, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, the ministry's technical arm, had identified 15 producing fields with a collective reserve of 791.2 million tonnes of crude oil and 333.46 billion cubic metres of gas, for handing over to private firms in the hope that they would improve upon the baseline estimate and its extraction. A year later, as many as 149 small and marginal fields of ONGC were identified for private and foreign companies on the grounds that the state-owned firm should focus only on big ones. The first plan couldn't go through because of strong opposition from ONGC, sources aware of the matter said. The second plan went up to the Cabinet, which on February 19, 2019, decided to bid out 64 marginal fields of ONGC. But, that tender got a tepid response, they said adding that ONGC was allowed to retain 49 fields on condition that their performance will be strictly monitored for three years. The ministry note of April 1, 2021, said two years have elapsed since the Cabinet decision and non-performing fields need to be identified for divestment and privatisation. It suggested market-friendly bid terms such as lower royalty rates and complete marketing and pricing freedom. For medium-sized producing fields, the action plan wanted ONGC to identify maturing fields such as Panna-Mukta, Ratna and R-Series in western offshore and Gandhar in Gujarat as well as fields such as Daman in western offshore which had upcoming development plans, for stake sale. It also wanted ONGC to consider developing new business models for monetisation of stranded assets/discoveries such as design, finance, built and operate as well as annuity and securitsation based models for development. Fields such as GK-28/42 and all unmonetised discoveries, either individually or as a bouquet, were identified for the purpose, the document showed. The note said that to reduce dependence on import of crude oil and gas, the ministry has set the domestic production target of 40 million tonnes of crude oil and 50 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas by 2023-24. The bulk of the targeted domestic production for 2023-24 is expected to come from ONGC, which is required to contribute 70 per cent of the domestic production (28 million tonnes of oil and 35 bcm of gas by 2023-24). It said the share of ONGC contribution in the oil and gas consumption of the country is decreasing continuously as its production is stagnant or decreasing for a long time. As a result import dependency is increasing.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) last year started gas production from the USD 5.07 billion KG-DWN-98/2 project in the Krishna Godavari basin, off the east coast of India. ""Gas production from Cluster-II has started as it is currently producing 320,000 standard cubic meters per day. May onwards, it will ramp up to 2.5-3 mmscmd,"" ONGC Director (Finance) Subhash Kumar said in an investor call. The output in the fiscal year beginning April (2021-22) is projected to average 3.4 mmscmd and 8.5 mmscmd in the following year. ""We are cautious in committing to any targets but 2023 or 2024 is a likely scenario for peak production,"" he said. ONGC is investing USD 5.07 billion in bringing to production a clutch of discoveries in the deep-sea block, also known as KG-D6. The block sits next to the KG-D6 discovery area of Reliance Industries Ltd and BP Plc. The project will cumulatively produce around 25 million tonnes of oil and 45 billion cubic meters of gas with peak production of 78,000 barrels per day of oil and 15 million standard cubic meters per day. ONGC started gas production from the project on schedule in early 2020 but the start of oil production has been delayed due to the outbreak of pandemic which disrupted global supply chains, he said. Crude oil production would start once a floating oil production unit, called an FPSO, is mobilised. Associated natural gas from Cluster 2A of this project will have a peak production of 3 mmscmd of gas and 78,000 barrels of crude oil per day with a 15-year profile; non-associated natural gas from Cluster 2B will have a peak free gas production of 12.25 mmscmd with a 16-year profile. Oil production from the block is expected to start in the next financial year. The project KG-DWN-98/2 involves some of the most advanced oil field technologies in drilling and completion of 34 subsea wells, laying about 425 km of pipeline and 150 km of control umbilical in water depths varying from 300 to 1,400 meters. On prices, Kumar said ONGC's breakeven cost for oil production is USD 50 per barrel and for gas is USD 3.50-3.70 per million British thermal unit. The firm can pay dividends to its shareholders if it realises a price upwards of USD 55 a barrel for oil and USD 5 per mmBtu for gas, he said. While currently, the company gets international rates for oil, the government fixes the price for natural gas. The gas price for six months to March 31 is USD 1.79 per mmBtu. Gas prices, he said, are at a record low and the company makes losses on the gas business. ONGC will produce 22.97 million tonnes of crude oil in the next fiscal as compared to 22-22.5 million tonnes in the current financial year ending March 31."

The rating agency has considered the consolidated financials of the ONGC, including ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL), Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) and some of the special purpose vehicles undertaking forward integration projects, to the extent of any financial commitments made to the stakeholders. This marks ICRA's outlook revision on ONGC group to stable from negative on account of recovery in crude oil prices from the lows of about $20 per barrel during April end to about $40 per barrel currently along with recovery in crude oil demand with the easing of lockdowns globally. ONGC accounted for nearly 62% of the country’s crude oil production and nearly 75% of its natural gas production in FY2019.

India is the world’s third-largest crude oil buyer and the fourth-largest LNG importer. It consumes 145 million standard cubic metres a day (mmscmd) of gas. A novel coronavirus outbreak in China has caused oil demand to plunge in the world’s second-biggest economy, forcing state-run CNOOC, China’s biggest LNG importer, to suspend contracts. Several refineries, including Sinopec, the world’s largest refiner, plan to reduce output or shut plants. This has also led shipping rates to fall. Trade tensions and a slowing global economy also have an overhang on energy markets. “Indian buyers thus have a window of opportunity to avail distress deals available on sea bound crude and LNG, meant for consumption in China,"" said Debasish Mishra, partner at Deloitte India. This comes against the backdrop of oil markets facing a situation called contango wherein the spot price is lower than a futures contract. Concerned over the situation, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) may advance its 5-6 March meeting, with its technical panel recommending a provisional cut to the Opec plus arrangement. According to S&P Global Platts, “30 to 60 million barrels of oil already purchased and on its way to China will need to be either resold and/or kept in storage for future use."" India is a key Asian refining hub, with an installed capacity of more than 249.36 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) through 23 refineries. Large Indian refiners include Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), Nayara Energy Ltd (formerly Essar Oil). and Reliance Industries Ltd. “Sinopec plans to reduce throughput by around 10% of its total 5.89 million b/d capacity in February,"" S&P Global Platts said. The state-run Petronet LNG Ltd said the company is not “contracting such cargoes"", said its managing director and chief executive Prabhat Singh. “There is anyway a glut in the market and it will reflect in spot buying. While it is not an ethical thing to do, nor is right from the corporate governance point of view, a market will behave like a market,"" he said. India is building up its LNG portfolio with local firms having inked long-term LNG contracts totalling 22mtpa. It has also been trying to renegotiate its LNG contracts with companies exploring strategies such as time swap of volumes, destination swaps, and contract on free on board basis to reduce the final fuel price. An IOC spokesperson declined comment. Queries emailed to the spokespersons of BPCL, HPCl, Nayara Energy Ltd, and RIL late on Friday evening remain unanswered. Meanwhile, the Indian industry has also been impacted by the coronavirus epidemic. Mint reported on 6 February about domestic power project developers who source solar modules from China planning to declare force majeure on meeting project completion deadlines because of supply disruptions following the coronavirus outbreak. Domestic companies are bracing for production shortages, disruption in shipments, and scarcity of critical bulk drugs and life-saving antibiotics as a result of a travel clampdown in China, which is battling to contain the epidemic. India imports more than $70.3 billion worth of goods from China and exports $17 billion."

Updated: 13 Aug 2019,Government seeks bids for Pawan Hans by 22 August,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/government-seeks-bids-for-pawan-hans-by-22-august-1565697617723.html," New Delhi: The government has initiated the second step for disinvestment of Pawan Hans Limited (PHL), inviting expression of interest from the prospective bidders to sell its stake in the helicopter PSU.  The Centre is planning to exit Pawan Hans by selling its 51% stake along with the transfer of management control. The Expression of Interest (EOI) window is open till August 22.  Both the shareholders of PHL -- the government and the ONGC will indemnify the contingent liabilities to the extent of over ₹500 crore for the potential buyers.  The renewed process had in fact gathered momentum with issuance of PIM (preliminary information memorandum) on July 11, 2019.  Now, the government proposes to disinvest its entire equity shareholding of 51 per cent in the PHL by way of strategic disinvestment to investor(s) along with transfer of management control.  The government has appointed SBI Capital Markets Limited (SBICAP) as its advisor to manage the strategic disinvestment process, DIPAM (Department of Investment and Public Asset Management) said in a notice.  Shortlisted Bidders (SBs) shall be provided with Request for Proposal in Stage II and would be required to submit their Financial Bid, SBI Caps said. After an unsuccessful attempt for sale of Pawan Hans earlier this year, the government provided indemnity to the potential buyers against contingent liability of over ₹500 crore in the helicopter service company.  The government had to make the bid document more attractive after discussions with investors on their concerns after the sale process of Pawan Hans failed to attract any suitor when the bidding ended on March 6.  ""It has been decided to indemnify the investors of the contingent liability of ₹577 crore which relates to disputed tax demand,"" an official said.  The government holds 51% stake in helicopter service provider Pawan Hans, and the remaining 49% is with the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). A total of 100 per cent stake in Pawan Hans, which has a fleet of 46 choppers, has been put on the block.  Though the renewed process has just started, officials said as per estimates of advisers to the deal, a 100% stake sale could fetch about ₹1,100- ₹1,200 crore to the government.  This disinvestment process is to be implemented through open competitive bidding route. Accordingly, Expression of Interest (EOI) is invited to be submitted from interested bidders on or before August 22, 2019.  Since the PIM was out earlier, the prospective bidders have sought clarity on Contingent Liabilities of PHL where they want to know: ""Whereas it is clearly laid out that the Centre will indemnify the successful bidder for 51% of the contingent liability - ₹577 crore, there is no clarity for the remaining 49%. Clarity on the balance 49% will have a direct impact on the bidding price and hence some clarity is required on the same.  It is expected that ONGC will provide the balance 49 per cent cover as they are obliged to sell at same terms as the government. SBI Caps has responded to that saying 'It is clarified that ONGC on its board resolution dated July 26, 2019 has accorded to indemnify the balance 49 per cent (to the extent of its shareholding) of the contingent liability as identified in the PIM'.""  Pawan Hans Ltd. is a Mini Ratna-I category Public Sector Undertaking under the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) and provides helicopter services for offshore operations, inter island transportation, connecting inaccessible areas, rescue work and tourism.

Updated: 04 Aug 2019,CCI dismisses abuse of dominance charge against ONGC,https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/cci-dismisses-abuse-of-dominance-charge-against-ongc-1564936729386.html,"NEW DELHI : The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has dismissed a complaint against ONGC alleging abuse of dominant position with regard to certain contractual provisions for hiring offshore support vessels. The fair trade regulator had ordered a probe against Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) in June 2018 after prima-facie finding the oil major in violation of competition norms. The complaint was filed by Indian National Shipowners' Association (INSA), a representative body of various ship owners. To support its offshore exploration and production activities, ONGC requires offshore support vessels (OSV). In this regard, it issues tenders for OSV suppliers with detailed technical eligibility requirements and special contract conditions (SCC), among others, collectively referred to as CHA. INSA had complained about the Charter Hire Agreement (CHA) of ONGC which had a particular clause that gave unilateral right to the state-owned firm to terminate the agreement. The said clause was one-sided and abusive in nature, INSA alleged. By terminating the agreement unilaterally, ONGC violated Section 4 of the Competition Act which pertains to abuse of dominant position in the relevant market, INSA alleged. For the case, CCI considered ""market for charter hire of OSVs in the Indian EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone)"" as the relevant one and found that ONGC was dominant in it. The prevailing circumstances also need to be taken into consideration to establish whether the firm abused its dominant position or not, CCI said. It is an undisputed fact that the crude oil prices started falling drastically from mid-2014, from over USD 100 per barrel to under USD 30 per barrel by January 2016, which affected oil companies worldwide, including ONGC, the fair trade regulator said. With drastic fall in oil prices, ONGC in April 2016 issued de-hiring notice to 27 vessels by invoking the unilateral termination clause. Regarding invoking of the clause, CCI said that there was an objective necessity to bring down the costs in new market circumstances and the termination was driven solely by this necessity and obligation. Besides, the clause was invoked by ONGC in an exceptional situation which was not an ordinary change of circumstance, it added. The clause ""which gives unilateral right of termination without assigning any reasons to ONGC, in itself is not found abusive given the disproportionate risk that ONGC has to bear in case of such termination by the OSV, especially when the Commission has found, in the given facts and circumstances, that the invocation of such clause was not in bad-faith"", CCI said in an order dated August 2. The regulator further said that had it been found that ONGC invoked the clause frequently in order to make illegitimate gains at the expense of the other contracting party, the Commission may have had the occasion to look at this case differently. No such situation seems to exist in the present case, it added. Accordingly, the ""Commission is of the considered view that in the present case the conduct of ONGC does not tantamount to an abuse of dominant position within the meaning of Section 4 of the Act"", CCI said and directed the case to be closed."
Updated: 12 Mar 2019,ONGC plans to invest more than $500 million in Mumbai High Field,https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/ongc-plans-to-invest-more-than-500-million-in-mumbai-high-field-1552350259570.html,"Mumbai: State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) plans to invest more than $500 million in its flagship asset, Mumbai High, to boost hydrocarbon production, two people aware of the development said. ONGC will employ enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods to improve oil recovery from the offshore field and has completed a pilot programme. “Mumbai High is ONGC’s vintage asset and the company is focused on maximizing recovery from the ageing field. Employing EOR methods is the only way to enhance production,"" one of the two people cited above said, requesting anonymity. ONGC did not respond to phone calls and text messages till publishing of this story. Mumbai High, formerly Bombay High, is an offshore oilfield located in the Arabian Sea, approximately 160km west of the Mumbai coast. It was discovered in 1974, started production in 1976. It consists of two blocks, Mumbai High North and Mumbai High South. A lot of value can still be derived from the legacy field. Almost 20% of new production will come from incremental projects between 2017 and 2025, according to a Wood Mackenzie report. ONGC envisages a cumulative gain of more than 190 mt of oil from the 28 EOR schemes that it is undertaking, according to its annual report of the last fiscal. “Low crude prices significantly dent the commercial viability of such schemes, which are usually higher on the cost curve. The break-even costs of three consecutive redevelopment phases since 2000 in Mumbai High North have escalated from $30 per barrel to $53 per barrel,"" according to ONGC’s Annual report for 2018. Last week, ONGC gave a contract for the engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning for development of a Cluster-8 marginal field, part of Mumbai High Asset, to L&T Hydrocarbon Engineering, a unit of Larsen and Toubro Ltd.

Updated: 21 Feb 2019,"Government asks ONGC, OIL to sell out 66 fields",https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/government-asks-ongc-oil-to-sell-out-66-fields-to-private-firms-1550758089356.html,"The government has asked state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) to sell out 66 of their small oil and gas fields to private firms as it brought in a new policy to boost domestic production and cut imports, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said Thursday. To quickly bring all sedimentary basins under oil and gas exploration, the government dumped a two-year-old model of bidding out acreage or blocks to firms offering highest share of revenue, and brought in a new system of bidding them out on the basis of work programme such as drilling of wells and shooting of seismic with the winner's only liability being payment of statutory duties like royalty and cess, he told reporters here. ONGC and OIL, who are battling stagnation in output from largely ageing fields, have a total of 184 fields. The national oil companies have been asked to provide enhanced production profile for 66 of these fields, which contribute 95 per cent of the 36 million tonne of annual oil production in the country, and given freedom to induct private and foreign partners or technology providers. They have been allowed to retain another 52 fields (49 by ONGC and 3 by OIL) where enhanced oil recovery or improved oil recovery programmes are already under implementation and they were put on production in the last four years. For the remaining 66 fields (64 belonging to ONGC and 2 to OIL), which currently contribute about 5 per cent of total output, will be bid out or privatised with revenue share going to the two firms. Giving details of the decisions taken by the Cabinet earlier this week, Pradhan said companies will be given pricing and marketing freedom for yet-to-be-developed discoveries and will levy a lesser royalty in case of state-owned firms raising production from existing fields. Marketing and pricing freedom will be given to those new gas discoveries whose field development plan (FDP) or investment proposal is yet to be approved. This would apply to both state producers like ONGC and private ones like Reliance. ONGC is sitting on two dozen discoveries which it had not been able to produce because of the current government-mandated price being less than the cost of production. Reliance also has discoveries in east coast block NEC-25 where it can produce after the new freedom. An incentive to produce additional gas from APM or nomination fields of state-owned firms like ONGC and OIL will be given in form of royalty reduction at the rate of 10 per cent on additional production over and above business as usual (BAU) scenario, which will be approved by the upstream regulator, DGH. Pradhan said the alongside, the government has decided to award future exploration acreage based on exploration work commitment, which will replace a two-year-old method of awarding them to companies offering the highest revenue share to the government. Exploration blocks in Category-I basins, where commercial production of hydrocarbon has already been established, will be bid out on the basis of a mix of work commitment and revenue share in the ratio of 70:30, he said. Exploration blocks in Category II and III basins will be awarded purely based on the exploration work programme, he said adding winning company's only liability would be to pay royalty and cess and there would be no profit share. ""There will be no revenue or production sharing in these contracts but the government will get a share in case of windfall gains,"" he said adding that the trigger for such a sharing has been fixed at USD 2.5 billion in a financial year from the block. Pradhan said the focus of the new policy is to raise output from the existing fields and bring newer areas under production quickly. ""Revenue or profit is no longer the priority. Production will be,"" he said. ""Fiscal incentive is being given for early monetisation of discoveries."" National oil companies (NOCs) have been given freedom to bid out fields and induct technology partners. ""Bidding process will be decided by the NOCs,"" he said adding the process is expected to be completed in four months. The BJP-led NDA government had two years ago moved from production-sharing contracts, where acreage for exploration of oil and gas was allocated to firms offering the largest work programmes (such as carrying out seismic survey and drilling of wells), to revenue sharing contracts, where the firm offering highest revenue to the government was given the blocks. In the older system, the explorer was guaranteed that his entire cost will be allowed to be recovered once commercially exploitable oil and gas is found. But in revenue sharing contract, the cost has no bearing and the companies are supposed to bid the revenue or production that they would give to the government at different levels of output and price. The move to revenue sharing was despite several industry players stating that prospectivity in the country was poor and there was a need to give incentives to companies for exploration. India has 26 sedimentary basins measuring 3.14 million square kilometers. These are classified into four categories: Category-I basins where commercial production has been established like Cambay, Mumbai Offshore, Rajasthan, Krishna Godavari, Cauvery, Assam Shelf and Assam-Arakan fold belt; Category-II basins with known accumulation of hydrocarbons but no commercial production so far such as Kutch, Mahanadi-NEC (North East Coast), Andaman-Nicobar and Kerala-Konkan-Lakshadweep. The category-III basins have hydrocarbon reserves that are considered geologically prospective such as in Himalayan Foreland basin, Ganga Basin, Vindhyan basin, Saurashtra basin, Kerela Konkan basin, Bengal basin; and Category-IV which are the ones having uncertain potential which may be prospective by analogy with similar basins in the world. These include Karewa basin, Spiti-Zanskar basin, Satpura–South Rewa–Damodar basin, Chhattisgarh basin, Narmada basin, Deccan Syneclise, Bhima-Kaladgi, Bastar basin, Pranhita Godavari basin and Cuddapah basin.

Updated: 19 Feb 2019,"ONGC delivers stellar Q3 result, but concerns over oil subsidy sharing remain",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/ongc-delivers-stellar-q3-result-but-concerns-over-oil-subsidy-sharing-remain-1550510429345.html,"Investors of state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) have had little luck with the stock for some time now. Shares of the oil and gas producer have underperformed the Nifty 100 index in the past one year by 26%. Unfortunately, the lag in the stock performance is not entirely due to oil prices. Investors have been concerned that ONGC will have to share some portion of the subsidy burden of the sector. For the nine-month period ended December, ONGC did not share any subsidy and made an oil price realization of $70 a barrel. However, this arrangement is not etched in stone. In fact, there is no formal agreement on the matter. “We are more conservative expecting subsidies in 4QFY19 to peg back full year FY19 oil realisations to ~$60 a barrel,"" said analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a 17 February report on both ONGC and state-run explorer Oil India Ltd. Nonetheless, better price realization was a factor that enabled the company’s profit to beat estimates for the December quarter in the absence of subsidy. Last week, when ONGC declared its Q3 results, its net profit of ₹8,263 crore exceeded a Bloomberg poll of analysts by 10%.  Strong “other income"" growth on a year-on-year basis, led by robust dividend income, also boosted net profit in Q3. The company’s gas production growth at 6.6% over the year-ago quarter compares well with the crude oil production decline of nearly 5%. The management told analysts in a post-results call that the proportion of gas production from difficult fields will increase to about 15% in fiscal year 2021 from about 5% in FY19. This is encouraging, as gas from difficult fields enjoy higher prices. The meaningful underperformance of the ONGC stock suggests that a good portion of the pessimism is built into the price. The stock is discounting net crude realization of only $33 a barrel because of political uncertainty ahead of the elections and the upside risk to crude oil price as a result of risks to production in Iran and Venezuela from US sanctions, point out analysts from SBICAP Securities Ltd. This is significantly lower than the $45-60 per barrel earned over the past decade, said the broker in a report on 15 February. Since the Q3 results were announced, the ONGC stock has risen by 3.7% on the National Stock Exchange. Current valuations at 5.6 times estimated earnings for FY20, based on Bloomberg data, are not demanding, to say the least."

The Public Enterprises Survey 2017-18, which mapped the performance of central public sector units, revealed that the top ten loss making PSUs claimed 84.71 per cent of the total losses made by all the 71 CPSEs. The three star performers, including Indian Oil Corporation, Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and NTPC, contributed 13.37 per cent, 12.49 per cent and 6.48 per cent, respectively to the total profit earned by CPSEs during 2017-18, the survey revealed. Coal India and Power Grid Corporation occupied the fourth and fifth spot in the list of top 10 profit making CPSEs (Central Public Sector Enterprises) in the 2017-18 fiscal. The three worst performing PSUs, including BSNL, Air India and MTNL, contributed 52.15 per cent of the total loss incurred by CPSEs in 2017-18. On the other hand, Power Finance Corporation entered into the list of the top ten profit making CPSEs, while Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd has not featured in the latest list. The top ten profit making CPSEs accounted for 61.83 per cent of the total profit earned by all the 184 profit making state-owned firms during the year. Bharat Coking Coal Limited incurred huge losses in 2017-18 and has entered into the list of top ten loss making CPSEs, while India Infrastructure Finance Co and Eastern Coalfields, which were profit making PSUs till 2016-17, have started making losses and featured in the list of top ten loss making state-owned firms during 2017-18.

Updated: 05 Feb 2016,Govt’s gas pricing formula not viable to develop Krishna Godavari basin gas: ONGC,https://www.livemint.com/Industry/iu5NDl7W9gZCFkscK5guBN/Govts-gas-pricing-formula-not-viable-to-develop-Krishna-God.html," New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) has sent an urgent message to the petroleum ministry, saying the natural gas prices according to a formula approved by the Union government was not viable to develop its Krishna Godavari (KG) basin discoveries. ONGC plans to invest multi-billion dollars in bringing to production its KG basin oil and gas discoveries by 2018-19. “We have requested the government for review of gas prices because at these prices the gas development is not viable,"" ONGC chairman and managing director Dinesh K Sarraf told reporters in New Delhi. The government had in October 2014 approved a new pricing formula based on average rate prevailing in gas surplus countries such the US, Russia and Canada for domestically produced natural gas. The rate, according to this formula, comes to $4.24 per million British thermal unit currently. This price, Sarraf said, is not enough to support multi-billion dollar investment for developing the gas finds, most of which are in deep sea and difficult areas. “$4.24 is definitely not viable,"" he said. ONGC has submitted to oil regulator directorate general of hydrocarbons a field development plan (FDP) for beginning oil and gas production from its KG-D5 block by 2018-19, but the plan does not include any investment number, he added. “We are yet to freeze that number,"" Sarraf said. The FDP is for one set of oil and gas discoveries made in the eastern offshore Block KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5, which sits next to Reliance Industries Ltd’s KG-D6 area. “We are looking at producing 77,000 barrels per day of oil and 14 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from the first set of discoveries by 2018-19,"" Sarraf said. The 7,294.6 sq. km. deep sea KG-D5 block has been broadly categorized into northern discovery area (3,800.6 sq. km.) and southern discovery area (3,494 sq. km.). ONGC has divided 12 oil and gas discoveries in KG-D5 and gas discovery in an adjacent G-4 block in the Bay of Bengal into three clusters to quickly bring them to production. PTI"
Updated: 13 Jan 2016,ONGC to cut operational cost as crude slumps to 12-year low,https://www.livemint.com/Industry/3px0RfVl3awQjLSKQoCiKO/ONGC-to-cut-operational-cost-as-crude-slumps-to-12year-low.html," New Delhi: With oil prices slumping to a 12-year low, state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) plans to cut operational cost by at least 10% by prioritizing activities and putting off the less important ones to future. ONGC plans to hire a consultant to suggest cost cuts and controlling operating expenditure as Brent falling to $31 per barrel almost equals to the company’s cost of production of every barrels of crude oil, people with direct knowledge of the development said. The company’s cost of producing every barrel of crude oil is $36 and after including return on investment as well as taxes and levies, the cost comes to $51.52 per barrel. The slump in oil prices to 12-year low will mean that ONGC pays less royalty. This compares to realization of $30-32 per barrel in the current quarter, just about squaring off the cost. People familiar with the matter said the company has already initiated measures to cut avoidable expenditure and is putting money only in priority tasks or activities needed to sustain its oil and gas exploration and production. There will be no cut in capital expenditure in oil and gas projects as such investment will help the company sustain or increase output, they said. The drop in international prices has also resulted in a corresponding drop in oilfield services firms, which the company wants to capitalize on and continue exploration and development works. People with direct knowledge of the matter said ONGC is unlikely to cut capex (capital expenditure) but only look at trimming its operating expenditure by shedding non-priority spendings. ONGC produces 24 million tonnes of crude oil annually, which is sold at international parity price. It loses ₹ 900 crore in revenue on every $1 per barrel drop in oil price. The company had planned a capital expenditure of ₹ 36,249 crore in the current fiscal and another ₹ 34,000-35,000 crore in the next. ONGC’s gross billing for crude oil it produced in the first half of the current fiscal was $57.33 per barrel as compared to $105.75 for the first half of last fiscal. The net realization after subsidy payout was $53.72 per barrel. In the third quarter, its gross billing was about $43 per barrel. People familiar with the matter said ONGC is hoping to get exempted from paying subsidy on liquified petroleum gas and kerosene after the oil price drop. Upstream firms such as ONGC sell crude oil to refiners at a discount so as to allow them to sell cooking fuel at government-controlled rate. ONGC is also hoping that the ₹ 4,500 per tonne cess on domestically produced crude oil is made ad valorem to help cut the statutory outgo by $6 per barrel to $8-9. PTI"
Updated: 26 Jul 2012,Assam violence hinders north-east projects,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/VbVwUxsXL8PTbW0oJvBZhJ/Assam-violence-hinders-northeast-projects.html," Marquee infrastructure projects being developed in India’s north-east have been affected due to the ongoing violence in the Bodoland territorial autonomous districts of Assam. Some of these projects include state-run NTPC Ltd’s 750 megawatt (MW) Bongaigaon project in Assam and NHPC Ltd’s Subansiri Lower 2,000MW hydropower project in neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh. “Work has stopped on our Bongaigaon project. One day of closure results in loss of two to three work days. The project is to have three units of 250MW each with the first unit to be commissioned next year,"" said a senior NTPC executive, requesting anonymity. Over the years, the state has been the site of violence orchestrated by rebel groups such as the United Liberation Front of Asom, the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, the Bodo Liberation Tigers and the Muslim United Liberation Tigers of Assam. “All our materials go through Assam to our other sites in the region. This violence may impact the ongoing projects in Agartala, Sivasagar, Jorhat and Silchar,"" said an ONGC executive who also didn’t want to be identified. “While our exploratory sites may be affected due to the stoppage in the movement of goods, the producing sites may go on for some time due to materials present on the sites. However, going forward, if the situation doesn’t improve, it may impact production."" ONGC has a gas production capacity of 3 million standard cubic metres per day (mscmd) of gas, of which it is currently producing 1.7 mscmd. At least 170,000 people from 4,000 villages in Assam have taken shelter in camps and other protected places. Security forces were absent in the first 24 hours since the clashes erupted, fuelling a cycle of violence and counter-violence without any let-up or hindrance. State-run NHPC’s Subansiri Lower hydropower project in Arunachal Pradesh, the utility’s biggest, is being hampered by blockades in Assam that have affected the movement of material to the site. “Whenever there is a problem in Assam, our project gets affected as our equipment passes through Assam. Subansiri has been affected due to the current crisis,"" said an NHPC executive who didn’t want to be identified. Another state-run explorer Oil India Ltd, which has interests in Assam, Rajasthan and Arunachal Pradesh, said it should have “no problem"" given the ample stocks at its sites. Officials in the Union home ministry said there were no fresh cases of violence and casualties in the state. Home minister P. Chidambaram said Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi is visiting the affected areas and will report about the situation after his return. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will visit the state on Saturday followed by Chidambaram next week. Union home secretary R.K. Singh said the situation has improved in the past two days. “Forty-two companies of paramilitary forces are already deployed and another 22 will reach by today evening (Thursday),"" he said. Earlier in the day, Muslim members of Parliament from across parties met Chidambaram over the ethnic clashes. “We told the minister that we have lost confidence in the state government’s ability to control the situation,"" said K. Rahman Khan, Congress member in the Rajya Sabha. “Chidambaram has assured that necessary action is being taken. Main problem is to bring back displaced people and gain their confidence. Home minister said situation has normalized...but we have reports that situation is still tense."" sahil.m@livemint.com"
Updated: 17 Jul 2012,India to continue with Vietnam block,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/ZZD2bl8pnSNb3LvbwGhKjP/India-to-continue-with-Vietnam-block.html," New Delhi: State-owned ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) will continue exploration activities in the South China Sea hydrocarbon block No. 128 for another two years, potentially bolstering Vietnam’s case in its dispute with China over the waters. Such an approach will also assert India’s presence in the region. The Indian Express newspaper reported on Tuesday that China had put the block up for global bidding. The report also mentioned that the move “has put Delhi in a spot as Vietnam is keen that India does not vacate this block"". “Since we found nothing significant in the block No. 128, we told the Vietnam government that we are surrendering the block. They told us to put two more years in the blocks and gave us additional data to improve the prospectivity in the block. We are studying the data. The decision has been good for us as there is no additional responsibility. The two-year period has started and OVL will continue in the block,"" said a top OVL executive on condition of anonymity. Mint’s queries to an OVL spokesperson and the Chinese embassy remained unanswered till press time. A ministry of external affairs spokesperson said that the ministry has no immediate comment to offer. China, which disputes sovereignty over the waters with Vietnam, had earlier objected to the presence of an Indian vessel surveying the area. China and Vietnam are among many countries that hold competing claims over the South China Sea and the islands in its waters. In June last year, tension flared between China and Vietnam over the Spratly and Paracel islands, following clashes between boats of the two nations. Despite Chinese objections to India-Vietnam energy cooperation in the disputed South China Sea, the latter two nations had in October last year signed a pact to expand their partnership in oil and gas exploration, refining, transportation and supply during Vietnamese President Truong Tan Sang’s visit to India. OVL is the only company among Indian state-owned firms producing assets overseas. It has a presence in 15 countries through participation in 33 projects and has proven balance of oil and gas reserves of 202.908 million tonnes. With India importing more than 80% of its energy needs, state-owned firms have been scouting overseas for securing assets and have invested ₹ 64,832.35 crore in the effort. This push has pitted the country against China in a race for the world’s resources. This competition for resources has, in turn, raised prices for the assets of both Indian and Chinese firms. China and India will be the world’s largest and third-largest economies and energy consumers by 2030, respectively, jointly accounting for about 35% of the global population, gross domestic product and energy demand, according to the BP Energy Outlook 2030. elizabeth.r@livemint.com"

The CoS on Tuesday heard presentations by gas producers Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Reliance Industries (RIL), and the fertilizer ministry, representing the point of view of the fertilizer industry, which is a consumer of gas. While the fertilizer ministry made it clear that the maximum delivered price of gas acceptable to it was $5 per mmbtu (million British thermal units), ONGC said that it was willing to accept anything above $4 as the well head price. “Our stand is very clear. We want the delivered price of gas to be below $5 per mmbtu."" “In the event of that not happening, the fertilizer subsidy burden on the exchequer will substantially increase,"" said a top official of the fertilizer ministry who did not wish to be identified. ONGC in its presentation made it clear that being a government owned f irm it understands its responsibilities towards the country and also the demands of the power and fertilizer sector. However, it said it was losing Rs700 crore a year on the sale of gas at administered prices. RIL’s gas could cost around $4.33 (Rs173.20) per mBtu at Kakinada. This price excludes marketing margins and transportation costs. RIL had submitted its formula for pricing to the petroleum ministry, which is in favour of approving this, but the pricing methodology is being questioned by the power and fertilizer ministries which want lower prices. The Andhra Pradesh government and Anil Ambani’s Reliance Natural Resources Ltd have also joined hands to oppose RIL’s pricing."
