Since the brokerage has set a target price of Rs. 2,900 for Titan, Rs. 3,650 for Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., and Rs. 1,390 for Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M), all of these blue-chip stocks offer tremendous potential upside from the current market price.  Sharekhan has said in a note that “Titan Company Limited’s (Titan) pre-quarter update outlined a good start to FY2023 with strong growth of 3.0x in revenue and robust growth across key businesses and subsidiaries. We expect revenue to be at Rs. 9,180 crore at a consolidated level (and ~Rs. 8,650 crore at a standalone level). Revenue of the jewellery business (excluding bullion sales in the base quarter) grew by 3x y-o-y i.e. to ~Rs. 7,570 crore. Despite near-term headwinds of high inflation, the company is confident of maintaining good growth momentum in the quarters ahead because of market share gains, network expansion, and shift to trusted brands. The company aims to achieve consistent double-digit revenue growth over the next five years by strengthening core businesses such as watches, jewellery, and eyecare through efficient capital allocation plans. Further, profitability is expected to consistently improve with consistent growth in the jewellery business and scale-up in new ventures."" “Titan is aiming to generate revenue CAGR of over 20% revenue during FY2022-FY2027 on back of its ambitious growth plan in the medium term. This along with consistent margin improvement will help cash flows to improve strongly in the coming years. FY2023 will be a strong year for the company due to low base in core businesses. The stock has corrected by ~15% in the past three months, in-line with substantial correction in the broader indices. The company’s strong growth outlook, industry tailwinds in the medium term, and strong balance sheet make it a best play in the retail space. Hence, we maintain our Buy recommendation on the stock with an unchanged price target (PT) of Rs. 2,900,"" said the brokerage.  The brokerage has said that “TCS reported steady revenue growth with strong client addition across large revenue buckets and healthy deal wins, while margins lagged our expectations owing to wage revisions, supply-side challenges and rising discretionary expenses. Constant currency (CC) revenue grew by 3.5%/15.5% y-o-y in Q1FY2023, in-line with our estimates, led by continued strong growth in North America and broad-based growth across verticals with strong growth in Retail & CPG. Deal TCVs remained healthy at $8.2 billion (including two large deals worth of $400 million+) during Q1FY23, up by 1.2% y-o-y, but it was down 27% q-o-q. The book-to-bill ratio stood at 1.21x, in-line with its long term average book-to-bill ratio. EBIT margin declined by 190 bps q-o-q to 23.1%, lagged our estimates. TCS continues see strong traction across cloud adoption, operating model transformation, vendor consolidation, growth and transformation (G&T) programs. We believe the company is well positioned to gain most from market opportunities even in case deteriorating macro concerns given its strong marquee clientele, strong capabilities and solid execution capability."" “We believe that TCS has a robust business model which would leverage both G&T opportunities and operation transformation program given its strong capabilities and end-to-end service capabilities. We expect the company’s US Dollar revenues and earnings to clock a 10%/11% CAGR over FY2022-24E. At CMP, the stock trades at valuation of 28x/25x its FY2023E/FY2024E earnings, in-line with 5-year average 1-year forward PE multiple. We continue to prefer TCS considering its better supply-management capability, best-in-class execution, deep expertise, full-service model and excellent payout ratios. Further, the stock price correction of around 14% on a YTD basis offers good entry opportunity for long-term investment. Hence, we maintain a Buy on TCS with a revised PT of Rs. 3,650,"" said Sharekhan.  As per the brokerage “Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) and British International Investment (BII) have executed a binding agreement to invest Rs. 1,925 crore ($250 million) each into M&M’s wholly owned subsidiary that will be incorporated soon to spin its passenger electric vehicle (EVCo) business. BII is a UK government development finance institution and a leading impact investor with focus on climate change and ESG. BII is expected to acquire 2.75-4.76% stake in M&M’s subsidiary EVCo at a valuation of US$ 5.1-8.8 billion (Rs. 40,441-70,070 crore). Promoters, along with investors to infuse ~Rs. 10,000 crore in the new EVCo between FY22 to FY27, to launch five electric vehicle models. The company targets its Electric SUV penetration to be 20-30% of its overall SUV portfolio by FY2027 and expects EV volumes at ~200,000 per annum in best case scenario. The EVCo will be asset light and leverage M&M’s ecosystem of suppliers, dealers and financers."" “M&M will provide manufacturing support, design, product development, technology and sourcing services on arm’s length. We firmly believe that M&M is on track with its growth roadmap. Besides its aggressive plans for the farm equipment and ICE passenger car segments, the company is taking leap towards making strong product portfolio for passenger electric vehicles. In the ICE segment, M&M has become No.1 in SUV revenue market share in H2FY22 with 16.8% market share. We expect Scorpio-N to further consolidate its share in the SUV market. Successful new launches will continue to help M&M to increase its market share in the SUV and LCV segments. M&M has guided for strengthening of the SUV segment through product launches of 13 new products by FY2027E, including EV launches. Further, the management continues to focus on the farm equipment segment and maintained its guidance to achieve a 10x revenue growth by FY2027E. M&M has maintained its FY25E guidance to deliver an 18% RoE and 15-20% EPS growth,"" said Sharekhan. The brokerage has further claimed that “We expect M&M to benefit from its leadership status in the tractor segment, strengthening position in the LCV segment and regaining its market share in the highly competitive SUV segment. M&M is on track with its growth roadmap. The company plans its farm business to grow 10x by FY2027E, while strengthen its SUV segment by adding 13 new products by FY2027E, including EV launches. The investment commitment of US$ 250 million by impact investor, British International Investment (BII), in M&M’s passenger electric vehicle arm is a positive development and would help M&M in attracting additional sources of private capital into EVCo venture. The EVCo business add Rs. 132 per share to our SOTP based PT. Further, M&M continues to benefit from the turnaround of loss-making subsidiaries, scaling up of digital platforms and strong performance of its listed entities, which would improve the company’s FCF going forward. We expect standalone earnings to post a 22.5% CAGR during FY22-FY24E, driven by a 16.7% revenue CAGR and 190 bps rise in EBITDA margins. We reiterate Buy rating on the stock with a revised PT of Rs. 1,390. The stock trades at a P/E multiple of 17.6x and EV/EBITDA multiple of 11x its FY24E estimates.""

Updated: 07 Jul 2022,Rakesh Jhunjhunwala portfolio: Brokerage says to buy this Tata group stock,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/rakesh-jhunjhunwala-portfolio-brokerage-says-to-buy-this-tata-group-stock-11657200198512.html,"With a market valuation of ₹188,876 crore, Titan Company Limited is a large-cap company that operates in the gem and jewellery industry. Being a TATA product, Titan is the largest and most reputable brand in India for accessories including jewellery, watches, and eyeglasses. When compared to the same period the previous year, Titan Company's first quarter ended in June 2022 (Q1FY23) sales increased by an astounding 205 per cent. Additionally, Titan's 3-year CAGR over Q1FY20 reached 20.5 per cent. As a result, brokerage firm Emkay Global is bullish on the stock and has given it a buy recommendation with a target price of ₹2,530.  Commenting on the performance of the company, Emkay Global has said in a note that excluding bullion sales, Jewelry revenues almost tripled YoY, led by growth in the number of buyers/walk-ins. The avg. ticket size remained stable. On a 3-Yr CAGR basis, growth in the jewelry segment accelerated to 23% in Q1 vs. 18-21% in the previous three quarters. TITAN attributed the strong trends to uninterrupted operations, the regionalization strategy and strong traction during the Akshay Tritya festival in May’22. The studded mix improved slightly from the previous year and was back to pre-Covid levels (~25%) in Q1. Tanishq’s network was expanded by 7 stores, including one in Dubai. “Watches/Eyewear posted a slower 3-Yr CAGR of 2%/8%, helped by a 6%/12% store count CAGR. Encouragingly, wearables growth quintupled on a low base, and the momentum remains intact in the second half. Store additions, however, have been particularly strong in both Eyewear/Watch segments, with 56/39 new store additions in Q1. The pick-up in store additions is encouraging and in line with Titan’s expansion outlook for these categories,"" said the research analysts of Emkay Global. As per the brokerage, TITAN Company’s “Caratlane maintained its strong growth trajectory with a 3-year CAGR of ~55%. Growth has been driven by a ~30% store count CAGR, launch of new merchandise, marketing campaigns and unlocking of markets. Other businesses (Taneira, Fragrances and Accessories) grew 29%, aided by high operational stores and new launches. TEAL’s revenue performance remained flat on a 3-year basis."" “Titan accelerated network expansion with the addition of 125 net stores across segments (vs. ~100 in Q3/Q4FY22), with 39/56 additions in watches and eyewear segments. In our view, a strong Q1 should drive an upgrade to consensus estimates. However, we do not see material changes to our estimates given near-term volatilities due to a recent customs duty increase and higher inflation. We currently have a Buy rating on TITAN with a TP of Rs2,530 (51x Jun’24E EPS),"" said Emkay Global. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala holds 3,53,10,395 Titan shares, or 3.98 per cent of the company, according to the Titan Company shareholding pattern for Q4FY22, which is publicly accessible on the BSE, while his wife Rekha Jhunjhunwala owns 95,40,575 shares or 1.07 per cent of the company's total paid-up capital.

Apparel retail saw the highest beat, driven by Trent and ABFRL as festive and marriage seasons turned in better than expected. Trent sustained its outperformance and record showing. Quick service restaurants saw an incremental recovery in dine-in drive with delivery staying stable quarter-on-quarter.

We were also sensitive to the fact that we don't know how the pandemic will play out. So we wanted to make lightweight a big mantra in our system,"" Ajoy Chawla, CEO, jewellery division, Titan Company, said in an interview. The jewellery pieces, internally tagged as Hi-Lites, were rolled out across the retailer’s 368 stores in the December quarter after a team of 40 people spent six months re-engineering and designing pieces to lower the grammage. In all, 3,500 pieces, only gold, not studded jewellery, have been “light-weighted"" in what is the most extensive exercise undertaken by the company to counter higher gold prices and safeguard consumer demand. On an average, Tanishq has undertaken 15-25% reduction in weight on jewellery pieces, including bangles, jewellery sets, rings, earnings etc set in 22 karat gold. Price of the yellow metal has jumped significantly since the early days of the pandemic, moving up to ₹46,650 as on 13 January 2022 from ₹38,070 per 10 grams for 22 carats on 1 January 2020. “With gold prices having gone up significantly over the last couple of years—over two years it's a 20%+ kind of a swing—we heard a lot of customers come back and tell us that their budget can't stretch so much but they’d like to own a certain product and design,"" Chawla said. The 3,500 pieces that have been redesigned as part of this exercise, together made for 30% of gold inventory at Tanishq stores in the December quarter. In the December quarter, sale from such pieces contributed close to 26% of the total jewellery business. The company used different ways to create light weight jewellery. It included design re-construction and technology, that is, the way it manufactures. ""Some of the products are machine made, so we did some changes in the way we are looking at manufacturing them so they use lesser gold. And third, we looked at some material innovation. We came out with a patented material, a hard alloy, which makes the same 22 karat gold harde, so people still get 22 carat but we can use lesser of the material to give the same dimension and stability,"" Chawla said. He added the move is helping Tanishq convert more walk-ins to shoppers. “We are expecting to serve at least a million customers in the next 12 months on the back of this initiative,"" he said. Inflationary pressure has prompted consumers to look for what's affordable, said market watchers. “Also, consumers want options for daily wear. In the last 2-3 years, gold prices have almost doubled which makes it very high for large sections of consumers,"" said Abneesh Roy, executive vice president, Institutional Equities at Edelweiss Securities. This kind of pricing and product will also work well especially on e-commerce, he added. In the December quarter, the company that also retails watches and perfumes, witnessed strong demand across its consumer businesses clocking 36% growth over the festive quarter last year, the company said in a quarterly update to the exchanges on 6 January. “Buoyancy in jewellery demand driven by festive purchases in October and November helped the division achieve significant revenue uplift for the quarter,"" it said. Both walk-ins and customer conversions were significantly higher compared to last year. New buyer growth was higher than total buyer growth, driven partly by Tanishq's regionalisation strategy of winning in focus markets. While ticket sizes were stable, they were 15% higher than pre-pandemic levels, the company added."

The company’s watch business revenues increased by 28%, helped partially by a softer base. In Q3FY21, watch revenues had declined by 12%. The company said multi brand channels, both online and offline, saw handsome growth last quarter. Overall, the strong revenue trends are likely to aid margin improvement. “The operating margin is likely to improve year-on-year in Q3FY22, led by a higher year-on-year contribution from the studded jewellery business. The strong topline growth would also drive Ebitda growth,"" said analysts from Motilal Oswal Financial Services. As things stand, many analysts are upbeat on growth prospects. Nonetheless, restrictions owing to the fresh surge in covid-19 cases are worth tracking. “Going ahead, we expect the jewellery division to continue to register strong performance, with stability in gold prices. However, the threat of new lockdowns given the rise in covid-19 cases remains to be a key monitorable,"" said analysts from Dolat Capital Market Pvt. Ltd in a note. Needless to say, investors will have to closely follow management commentary on demand trends when the December quarter results are announced. Note that the Titan stock has appreciated as much as 65% over the past year, rendering valuations pricier.
