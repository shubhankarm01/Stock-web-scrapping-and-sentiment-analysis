Updated: 06 Dec 2021,Sputnik Light to be made in India soon: Russian foreign minister,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/sputnik-light-to-be-made-in-india-soon-russian-foreign-minister-11638799800828.html,"Talks to begin production of one-shot Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik Light in India are nearing completion, Russian news agency TASS quoted nagtion's External Affairs Minister Sergey Lavrov as saying on Monday. Lavrov arrived in Delhi with Russian President Vladimir Putin and took part in the inaugural Indo-Russia '2+2' dialogue along with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar. Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Russian Defence Minister Gen Sergey Shoigu also participated in the bilateral talks. Earlier today, Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which helped create the Sputnik vaccines with the nation's Gamaleya Institute, said in a statement that it is actively cooperating with India’s regulatory authorities on registration of Sputnik Light as a standalone vaccine and a universal booster and expects it to be authorized in the country soon. Sputnik Light is a one-shot vaccine based on human adenovirus serotype 26, the first component of the Sputnik V, which has already been approved for use in India. “A major partner of RDIF, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, has conducted additional clinical trials of Sputnik Light in India. Positive data from these trials has also been presented to India's regulator,"" RDIF said. The latest findings by the Gamaleya Center based on data from 28,000 subjects in Moscow have demonstrated that Sputnik Light administered standalone has 70 per cent efficacy against infection from the Delta variant of coronavirus during the first three months after vaccination. The vaccine is 75 per cent effective among subjects under the age of 60. Efficacy of Sputnik Light as a booster against Delta variant for other vaccines will be close to the efficacy against the Delta variant of the Sputnik V vaccine: over 83 per cent against infection and over 94 per cent against hospitalisation. RDIF claims that Sputnik Light has proven to be safe and highly effective by real-world vaccination data. In particular, the vaccine has demonstrated efficacy of between 78.6-83.7 per cent among the elderly as confirmed by the Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Paraguay’s Ministry of Health also found Sputnik Light to be 93.5 per cent effective during the country’s ongoing vaccination campaign."
Updated: 28 Jul 2021,Dr Reddy's shares continue to bleed. Is it a 'buy on dip' opportunity?,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/dr-reddy-s-shares-continue-to-bleed-is-it-a-buy-on-dip-opportunity-11627452321035.html,"Dr Reddy's share price: After hitting 10 per cent lower circuit on Tuesday, Dr Reddy's shares have further extended its downside trend and crashed more than 3 per cent in the intraday trade session. According to stock market experts, this heavy beating in the pharma stock is mainly due to the lower than expected Dr Reddy’s Q1 results. They said that markets were expecting rise in its profit while it reported slump in its quarterly profit. However, they maintained that such dip in Dr Reddy's share price should be seen as an opportunity to take 'positional call' in the counter as triggers like Sputnik vaccine manufacturing in India from September this year and fear of third wave are still around. Speaking on the triggers that is expected to favour Dr Reddy's shares in near term; Ravi Singhal, Vice Chairman at GCL Securities said, ""The recent beating in Dr Reddy's stock is due to the below par quarterly results of the company. But, it is a short-term sentiment that is expected to fade away in next one to two trade sessions. One should look at taking positional call in the counter at this juncture as it has slipped around 14 per cent in the last two trade sessions."" Asked about the triggers aiding Dr Reddy's shares; Ravi Singhal of GCL Securities said, ""Dr Reddy's is going to start manufacturing of Sputnik vaccine in India from September this year that is expected to work as big trigger for the company's stock. Apart from this, we are once again witnessing rise in cases of Covid-19 in various parts of India and abroad, which reflects that third wave of Covid-19 is still around. If that happens, there will be huge demand for Covid vaccines — a situation that augurs well for Dr Reddy's share price outlook."" Standing in sync with Ravi Singhal's views; Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking said, ""Dr Reddy's shares have strong support at ₹4400 and one can initiate buy in the counter below ₹4600 mark for the immediate target of ₹5,000 maintaining stop loss at ₹4400."" Highlighting the positives that may help Dr Reddy's share price rally; Kunal Dhamesha, Research Analyst at Emkay Global Securities said, ""After the sharp correction in the stock price following the result announcement, the stock is trading at an attractive P/E multiple of 24 against the historical average P/E multiple of 26,"" adding, ""(Dr Reddy’s Laboratories) Management alluded that profitability will improve meaningfully from Q2, driven by the ramp-up of recently launched products, higher growth in the branded markets and an increase in API scale. Management also reiterated its long-term EBITDA margin guidance of 25 per cent."" Kunal Dhamesha of Emkay Global Securities advised stock market investors to buy Dr Reddy's shares for one year target of ₹5,755 per stock levels. On strategy for those who hold Dr Reddy's stocks in their portfolio; Yash Gupta, Equity Research Associate at Angel Broking said, ""We suggest investors to hold Dr Reddy's Laboratories limited at this level as we believe that all the short term negatives have been priced in the stock price. We are not recommending to follow the buy on dips strategy on Dr Reddy's as stock may remain under pressure for some time."" Yesterday, Dr Redd'y Laboratories limited reported a weak set of numbers, which had a big miss on gross margins as well as EBITDA margins. Company has received the Subpoena from securities and exchange commission for the production documents for allegations related to improper payments, which is not good news for the company. Based on results by other pharma companies, we have seen some initial signs of price erosion in the USA market, which is not good news for the Indian pharmaceutical companies. Management expects margins to improve in upcoming quarters on the back of recovery in the India market and several new launches in the USA market."

Updated: 27 Jan 2020,Dr Reddy’s surprises the Street in December quarter as margins rise,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/dr-reddy-s-decent-q3-show-surprises-the-street-margins-expand-11580120918282.html,"Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd’s recovery has been slow but steady, with health metrics improving across regions. Its stock got a boost soon after the earnings were announced, rising by 5.2% on Monday. Revenue rose 14% year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q3, with decent volume and value growth coming from its main US and Indian markets. Sequentially, however, revenue fell 9% as the firm had recognized revenue of about ₹720 crore from out-licensing two products in the preceding three months. Price erosion in the US continues, though at a slower pace. In fact, Dr Reddy’s reported an 8% y-o-y revenue growth in the US due to a steady stream of launches. Some of its older products also gained volumes. Analysts attribute the US growth due to deeper penetration, despite the fact that the company had to take one-off impairment charges. “The firm’s diversified product range in the US has done well, and revenue growth comes as a surprise to the Street. Besides, the Street had already discounted the impairment costs,"" said Kunal Damesha, an analyst at SBICap Securities Ltd. Still, one of the issues pending before Dr Reddy’s is the ongoing re-inspection of its API manufacturing plant at Srikakulam. In November 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had issued this plant a warning letter. This has been an overhang on the stock for some time now. However, domestic drug demand is expanding, thanks to deeper penetration and growth in brand-named generics. In the December quarter, domestic revenue grew 13% y-o-y. Dr Reddy’s reported decent growth in all categories it operates in. Overall global sales are on the rise due to the increase in incidences of diseases and viral outbreaks. Russia, for instance, grew 20% y-o-y, while emerging markets expanded 12% y-o-y. Therefore, an improvement in operating parameters is on expected lines. The Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin rose to 24.5%. Margins are likely to remain firm in the coming quarters. The Dr Reddy’s stock has arrested the fall it saw about 18 months ago due to the FDA warning and slow growth, but has been rising this past year. Analysts appear sanguine about its prospects. But positives may already be priced in, as the stock has gained 22% this past year."
