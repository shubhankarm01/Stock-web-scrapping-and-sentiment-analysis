Shares of capital goods company Thermax Ltd surged to a new 52-week high of Rs2,174.80 intraday on the NSE on 2 February. The increased outlay for capital expenditure announced in the Union Budget on 1 February had a rub-off effect on the stock. But that optimism soon fizzled out. Currently, trading at ₹1,831 on the NSE, shares of company have slid 17% from its recent high. Its Q3FY22 results announced on 4 February, were a miss as operating performance disappointed. Analysts point out that the company's consolidated revenue of ₹1,610 crore, although up 14.5% year-on-year, lagged consensus estimates by 1.8%. Since then, the stock has declined 9%. This is depsite the management's upbeat outlook. In a post earnings conference call, the Thermax management said, it was confident of strong order intake as capex scenario continues to improve. According to them, the company's base business is strong amid rising enquiry levels.  Also, there is good traction from the steel sector as two big companies have announced expansion plans and there will be orders from them in the next few quarters.   Indian bond yields edged lower on Tuesday after the Union government cancelled a second straight weekly debt auction on the back of comfortable cash balances, while in-line retail inflation data also aided sentiment. The benchmark 10-year bond yield was trading at 6.62%, down 5 basis points on the day. It has now erased all losses made since the budget on Feb. 1 when the session low for the 10-year was at 6.65%. Yields had surged sharply after the budget, with the 10-year rising to as high as 6.95% in subsequent days, on account of the record market borrowing announced for the next fiscal year and a higher-than-expected fiscal deficit target.   Benchmark iron ore futures plunged on Tuesday, extending Monday's sharp losses, as traders charged out of the commodity amid fears of a China clampdown as Beijing warned it would act against what it called the spread of misinformation on prices. The most-traded iron ore for May delivery on China's Dalian Commodity Exchange tumbled as much as 9.7% to 701 yuan ($110.35) a tonne, its weakest since 18 January. The steelmaking ingredient's front-month March contract on the Singapore Exchange slumped by as much as 11.4% to $131.55 a tonne.   “The markets have opened in the green which seems like a knee-jerk reaction to the fierce fall of the last two sessions. One should trade the current scenario with caution. The bias still remains on the downside and for the time being, upward market movements are opportunities to look for short-selling signals for a projected target of 16300-16400. The resistance for the Nifty is at 17400-17500.""   Gold prices climbed to an eight-month high on Tuesday, as heightened tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine prompted investors to shun riskier assets and opt for safe-haven bullion. Spot gold was up 0.3% at $1,876.71 per ounce, after hitting its highest level since June 11 at $1,878.88 earlier in the day. U.S. gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,879.00. Due to the Ukraine crisis, gold is supported through the inflation channel because of higher crude oil prices and through the risk aversion channel because of lower stocks, said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.   ACC Ltd., part of Holcim India, on Tuesday announced the successful commissioning of 1.6 MTPA grinding unit at Tikaria in Uttar Pradesh.

(Read here)   China’s central bank stepped up support for its slowing economy by pumping in cash via policy loans for a second straight month. The benchmark stock index advanced, outperforming regional equities. The People’s Bank of China injected a net 100 billion yuan ($15.7 billion) into the banking system with its medium-term lending facility, while leaving the borrowing rate unchanged. The CSI 300 rose as much as 1.1%. Chinese banks in January extended a record amount of loans after the PBOC lowered borrowing costs for the first time since 2020 last month. The latest move, seen as a prelude by many to further easing, comes as the economy struggles with repeated Covid outbreaks, a slowdown in the property sector and signs of weak domestic demand.   Promoters of drugmaker Cipla Ltd, Yusuf Khwaja Hamied and Mustafa Khwaja Hamied, will sell up to 2.5% of their stake in the company to institutional investors through a block trade that could fetch as much as ₹1,849 crore, or $244.6 million. The block trade involves a base sale of a 2% stake with an option to increase the deal size to 2.5%, according to deal terms seen by Mint. Cipla’s promoters held 36.11% stake in the company as of 31 December. The shares are being offered to investors in the price range of ₹904.8 to ₹916.7 per share.   Tensions surrounding Ukraine have impacted equities across the world. Heated geo-politics raise fears of disruption in world trade and further rise in crude oil price; something that the world can ill-afford, especially when all countries facing huge fiscal deficits due to support given to their economies during Covid. Back in India, banking stocks were a big drag on low sentiments, due to impact of ABG Shipyard scam on their books. These issues add to the existing overhang of US Fed possibly raising rates in March 2022. After rising from 7,500 to over 18,000, the Nifty has been consolidating since mid-October 2021. Looking at the fall of the last 30 days, it seems like the Nifty could further correct from present levels. Historically it has been observed that February tends to be volatile, especially post Budget. It is possible for the Nifty to fall up to 15,800 level. However, the long-term structure of the Indian stock market is intact. We remain bullish in 2022 and beyond. Focus on adding quality stocks in the current fall.   Cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value and could even be worse than Ponzi schemes, RBI deputy governor T Rabi Sankar said on Monday, advocating a ban even while India is undecided on regulating them. “We have seen that crypto-technology is underpinned by a philosophy to evade government controls,"" Sankar said at the 17th Annual Banking Technology Conference and Awards of the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA). “Cryptocurrencies have specifically been developed to bypass the regulated financial system. These should be reason enough to treat them with caution."" According to Sankar, cryptocurrencies are not amenable to definition as a currency, asset or commodity and these should be reason enough to keep them away from the formal financial system. That apart, cryptos also undermine financial integrity, especially the KYC regime and Anti-Money Laundering and Combating of Financing of Terrorism regulations and at least potentially facilitate anti-social activities, he said. (Read here)   The Delhi high court (HC) has dismissed Zostel Hospitality Pvt. Ltd’s interim petition claiming 7% holding in Oravel Stays Ltd, the parent of Oyo. This comes as a big relief to the SoftBank-backed startup that is awaiting regulatory approval for its ₹8,340 crore initial public offering (IPO) filed last year. The Delhi HC’s single-judge bench comprising justice C. Hari Shankar passed the ruling on Monday. “While we await the full order, we believe that Zostel’s demand for issuance of 7% shares of Oyo under the arbitration award has also been rejected,"" a spokesperson for Oyo said. “This verdict vindicates our stand that Zostel has been trying to mislead the public at large. We hope this will act as a strong deterrent for Zostel’s endless forum shopping efforts and be a conclusive closure of this matter,"" the spokesperson added.   ""We closed below 17000 which is a matter of concern as the bears would now take over the medium-term trend of this market. The index can slide further to 16300-16400. Any up move would now become an opportunity to sell the Nifty.""   Digital payments and financial service firm Paytm on Monday said gross merchandise value (GMV) processed through its platform more than doubled to ₹83,481 crore in January. Paytm's GMV in January 2021 stood at ₹41,000 crore, the company said in a regulatory filing. The company disbursed 19 lakh loans amounting to ₹921 crore in January, which was over threefold higher compared with four lakh loans worth ₹212 crore that the company disbursed in January 2021. The average monthly transacting users grew 40 per cent to 6.89 crore in January, from 4.93 crore a year ago.   Oil prices fell on Tuesday as investors took profits from the previous day's rally to seven-year highs and as global stock markets slumped, although losses were capped by fears that Russia might invade Ukraine and disrupt supplies. Brent crude futures was at $96.19 a barrel, down 29 cents, or 0.3%, after rising $2.04 on Monday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude dropped 36 cents, or 0.4%, to $95.10 a barrel, after gaining $2.36 the previous day. Both benchmarks hit their highest since September 2014 on Monday, with Brent touching $96.78 and WTI reaching $95.82. Russia is one of the world's largest oil and gas producers, and fears it could invade Ukraine have driven a rally in oil towards $100 per barrel, a level not seen since 2014.   Asian stocks fell on Tuesday as traders assessed geopolitical risks, worries about Federal Reserve policy tightening and steps by China’s central bank to support growth. Shares fluctuated in China, where the monetary authority injected a net 100 billion yuan ($15.7 billion) into the banking system with its medium-term lending facility. Equities wavered in Hong Kong and retreated in Japan. Gyrations over Ukraine took a twist Monday, when its President Volodymyr Zelenskiy wobbled markets with what his office later said was a sarcastic comment about the rest of the world predicting a Russian attack on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Fed officials came out with another round of views on the policy outlook. Fed Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said the monetary authority needs to move forward its plans to raise rates to underline its inflation-fighting credibility. Japan’s Topix index fell 0.4%, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 index was down 0.2%. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.5%, South Korea’s Kospi was flat, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 0.1%, while China’s Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.1%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 171.89 points, or 0.49%, to 34,566.17; the S&P 500 lost 16.97 points, or 0.38%, at 4,401.67; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.24 points to 13,790.92.  "

Updated: 26 Jan 2022,"Cipla’s Q3 performance better than expected on strong show in India, US",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/ciplas-q3-performance-better-than-expected-on-strong-show-in-india-us-11643175834291.html,"Cipla Ltd’s better-than-expected performance for the quarter ended December was driven by strong performance in India and the US markets. Expectations around the India business growth were muted due to a high base of last year driven by covid-19 drug sales.  The company's Ebitda margin contracted 130 basis points year-on-year (YoY) to 22.5% due to higher other expenses and spending on R&D which were partially offset by lower staff cost. The company said that other expenses in 3QFY22 can be considered to have normalized as Covid-19 situation eases. Higher tax expenses also took a toll on net profit which declined 2.6% YoY. However, both Ebitda and net profit of ₹1243 crore and ₹729 crore, respectively, were ahead of analyst estimates. Analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services had estimated Ebitda and net profit of ₹1114.6 crore and ₹656 crore, respectively. Those at ICICI Securities Ltd expected Ebitda and net profit of 1145.6 crore and ₹640.3 crore, respectively. Domestic sales that contributed 46% to overall revenues remained a key growth driver for Cipla’s performance. Strong growth in the Indian market should lend confidence to investors on the future prospects of the company. Analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services expected domestic formulation sales to decline 4% YoY with lower demand for covid-19 drugs. However, the overall India business grew by 13% YoY led by sustained momentum across core therapies and traction in flagship brands despite modest contribution from covid-19 drug portfolio.  In another key geography, the US, Cipla continued its strong performance. US sales were up 9% YoY and 6% sequentially, contributing slightly more than fifth to the overall number.   The company’s respiratory portfolio continues to contribute to this traction, marking a growth of 36% YoY in dollar terms, according to the company. Albuterol and Arformoterol inhaler generics are regularly gaining market share, strengthening the company's US sales. The drugmaker said its share of Albuterol and Arformoterol stood at strong 15.9% and 26.8% of the overall market respectively. US business for Cipla now sees a new base of $150 million quarterly run-rate, said the firm in a post-results conference call. The company is in the process to share more data with the USFDA on Abraxane generics and is confident for the second half FY23 launch. This chemotherapy drug launch is awaited eagerly and remains a meaningful asset on a long term basis. Besides, the company is also in the process to launch its product Lanreotide for the US market, the approval for which it already had received in December. Another key launch awaited during FY23 is that of Advair inhaler generics. With two key markets firing at all cylinders, the company managed to post a strong 6% revenue growth in Q3. However, some disappointments were seen in South Africa, Sub-Saharan and Cipla Global Access business that saw sales decline 2% YoY.  "

Earlier this year, Sun Pharma, Torrent Pharma and Cipla had signed a non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreement with Merck to manufacture and supply a generic version of molnupiravir in over 100 low and middle-income countries (LMICs) including India. The DCGI, based on the review of clinical data of molnupiravir has approved the drug for treatment of adult patients with Covid-19, with SpO2 > 93% and who have high risk of progression of the disease including hospitalisation or death. The recommended dose of the drug is 800 mg twice a day for five days. The duration of treatment of molnupiravir is much shorter compared to other therapies which is a significant advantage as it reduces the pill burden and enhances compliance. The regulatory approval comes on the back of a five-month collaborative trial conducted by a consortium of companies. Molnupiravir will be manufactured in India by a total of 13 companies for restricted use under emergency situation for treatment of adult patients with Covid-19. Molnupiravir is the oral antiviral approved by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorisation for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 in adults. The antiviral drug has been shown to reduce hospitalisations and deaths by around 30% in a clinical trial.

Molnupiravir is approved for use in adult patients who test positive and are at high risk of progressing to severe disease leading to hospitalization and even deaths. The USFDA statement makes it clear that the new pill must be prescribed only when other USFDA-authorized treatments are inaccessible or not clinically appropriate. In India, molnupiravir is being evaluated by a Subject Expert Committee (SEC) that advises the country’s drugs regulator — the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) — on product approvals. Data from clinical trials on Indian subjects are with the SEC. Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy’s and Cipla are already licensed by Merck to manufacture and supply this drug in India and other low and middle-income countries. The SEC has reportedly asked drug companies why accelerated approval must be granted in light of the relatively low efficacy of the drug. It also sought a risk mitigation plan in case of an adverse event. The nod for molnupiravir in the US follows close on the heels of the approval for Pfizer’s Paxlovid, comprising two co-packaged drugs nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. Paxlovid is the first USFDA-approved oral treatment for Covid-19. It has shown better efficacy than molnupiravir in trials.    "

The India business growth of 16% year-on-year (y-o-y) provided the positive impetus. Adjusted for covid-19 product contribution, the growth came in at 23% as per analysts. The respiratory, urology, anti-infective and cardiology portfolios helped the company’s India sales. Sales in South Africa also maintained a steady growth momentum. South Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Cipla Global Access (SAGA) grew 8% y-o-y in US dollar terms. Both India and SAGA performance pulled the company's Q2 show up as US sales revenues, though impressive at $142 million, marked only marginal growth. Steady momentum in core products was able to offset price erosion in the rest of the portfolio. The company’s consolidated sales grew 10% y-o-y while ebitda and net profit grew 4% and 7% respectively. Analysts at Nomura Research said that “Q2FY22 results came in ahead of our expectations"". The sales/ebitda/net profit was 9%/13%/11% above their estimates. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization. Analysts feel that the company’s forward prospects hold promises.

The US albuterol market remains steady in terms of demand and pricing, say analysts, and this is a big positive.

Meanwhile, the analysts feel that rising clarity on launch timeline for larger products in the US market is likely to improve earnings outlook In view of the good line-up of sizeable launches in FY23 (generics of Revlimid, Abraxane and potentially Advair), analysts at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Pvt. Ltd, expect US sales to accelerate significantly from H2FY23. They expect its US sales to be in the $140 million- ₹150 million range for the remaining quarters of FY22, backed by the scale-up of respiratory sales and improving reach in channels"" The Cipla stock was trading more than 1% in morning trades on Wednesday."

Updated: 30 Sep 2021,Cipla’s shares echo investors’ bet on sustained core growth,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/ciplas-shares-echo-investors-bet-on-sustained-core-growth-11633022599482.html,"Cipla Ltd’s shares have so far gained more than 20% in FY22, a sign that investors are keeping faith in its growth prospects. Indeed, the company is expected to witness a strong revival in portfolios that were overshadowed by the surge in covid-related drugs so far. Even as the boost from covid-19 drugs wanes, Cipla’s acute segment is expected to come to the fore and support growth. The company’s domestic portfolio comprises both chronic and acute products. Chronic segment contributions have remained strong during the past quarters. As such, the rising pace of pharma market growth bodes well for companies such as Cipla that see strong domestic market contributions. Domestic market share in overall revenues is about 40% for Cipla. Yet another factor supporting growth is the rebound in sales of respiratory therapy. Cipla is known for its strong domestic respiratory franchisee. In addition, other therapies such as analgesics, anti-infectives, gynaecology have shown a quick revival as well, making the outlook for domestic growth appealing. The trailing 12-month domestic sales growth for Cipla stood at 19.8% till August, data shows. In fact, growth prospects for the respiratory portfolio remain strong even in the US market. The company’s launch of Albuterol inhaler generics in the US has helped sales there despite pricing pressures. On the other hand, many peers such as Lupin and Cadila have seen significant pressure on their US sales performance in the past quarters. Cipla is seeing market share gains in Albuterol generics. A mid-September report by analysts at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities on the prescription trends in the US market suggested that Cipla has been able to gain 300 basis points market share on a sequential basis. The Street is also optimistic about more product launches as the respiratory portfolio unfolds. Cipla is expecting approval for generic Advair in the US market, which is believed to be a much bigger and meaningful opportunity. Besides respiratory products, Cipla continues to work on peptide-based products to build and enhance its niche pipeline for the US market. Be that as it may, most of the positives seem to be baked into its valuations. With recent gains, the stock trades at about 27 times FY22 earnings estimates, leaving little room for further upside."

On Monday, Raymond announced an organisational restructuring plan which will see its fast-fashion business consolidating with the parent company and the auto components and tools and hardware businesses merging into its engineering division. Meanwhile, its nascent real estate division will be made a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. The restructuring plan is aimed at monetising its assets, cutting debt and improving operational synergies. In a statement, chairperson Gautam Singhania said, We are consolidating the business to explore all options available to us for monetization, which will enable deleveraging leading to value creation. Back in November 2019, the company had announced the demerger of its apparel business held under Raymond Apparel. The demerger scheme has been withdrawn and the lifestyle business will be transferred to Raymond to streamline the group’s B2C businesses. Raymond share price has opened the day up by 4%. Moving on to news from the automobile sector, India’s largest PV maker Maruti Suzuki has told its component suppliers to be ready to produce 160,000-180,000 cars and SUVs in October, as it is making arrangements to secure supply of semiconductor chipsets through multiple channels. If Maruti does manage to meet this target, the October output would be 60-80% higher compared with September, and just about 5% short of the numbers a year earlier. Due to global shortage of semiconductors, Maruti has been forced to limit production this month to around 100,000 units. Reports state that the company’s ability to source chips may have improved with an easing Covid-19 situation in Malaysia. The Southeast Asian country's chip manufacturing facilities are now working for seven days a week in three shifts. About two-thirds of the targeted output are likely to be managed out of Maruti Suzuki's own facilities in the national capital region. The remaining will be sourced from Suzuki Motor Gujarat, another Indian unit of parent Suzuki Motor of Japan. However, according to industry insiders, there’s no guarantee that Maruti will meet the target. They say that the guidance was probably meant to keep the vendor network ready in case the chipset availability improved. The company is also urging vendors to prepare for an output of over half a million in the October-December quarter. That suggests production growth of 7.5% from a year earlier in the crucial festive season. Maruti Suzuki share price has opened the day up by 0.3%. (This article is syndicated from Equitymaster.com)"

The rebound in the acute segment complements that in the chronic segment, helping the pharma market growth. India Ratings and Research said the 17.7% year-on-year revenue growth in IPM during August was led by improving sales in the non-covid products portfolio even as traction in covid product sales continued. Amongst the segments, respiratory care led the pack, clocking a growth of 38.2% during August. The pickup in the segment bodes well for companies such as Cipla Ltd that offer an extensive range of respiratory products. The respiratory segment had seen 22.8% YoY growth in July. Analgesics and anti-infectives recorded a growth of 32.4% and 29.2% YoY respectively. The 5.8% growth in prices, and 3.5% growth in new product launches were helped by 5.9% growth in volumes, suggest Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd data. On moving three months average, the industry growth stood at 14.5% year-on-year. Among therapies that led this growth included anti-infectives, vitamins and minerals, and gastrointestinal drugs. Sales for these grew 25.4%, 21.6%, and 20% YoY respectively. Analgesics with 15.6% growth too impressed.

This was led by a strong 68.5% growth in domestic sales that contributed almost half of its overall sales. While the company benefitted from strong sales of covid-related products, good volumes in the core therapy portfolio also helped. The acute and respiratory segments also saw a recovery. The US region that contributes about one-fifth of its overall revenue saw stable performance. The contribution from respiratory inhaler Albuterol generics launched last year continues to drive growth with regular market share gains. The firm attributed the 5% year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in US revenues to the continued expansion in market share of Albuterol.  The South Africa market, where Cipla has its front end, remains a key geography. Sales in the South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and Global Access (SAGA) region marked 13% y-o-y growth in dollar terms. The region contributed about 15% to overall revenues. The firm said it saw double-digit growth and market share gain in the Antiretroviral and oncology private market. It also moved up three places to third in the systemic anti-infectives private market. Cipla’s overall revenue grew 27% y-o-y to ₹5,453 crore, higher than the ₹4,606.5 crore in the previous quarter. Ebitda at ₹1,346 crore also saw 28% y-o-y growth, while net profit grew 24% y-o-y. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said Q1FY22 sales and Ebitda exceeded their estimates by 7% and 9%, respectively, led by higher-than-expected domestic sales amid strong traction in the covid portfolio. Going forward, though, the extraordinary gains accrued by the covid portfolio may moderate. Nevertheless, the firm’s strong chronic portfolio and pick-up in acute segment sales bode well for domestic growth. “We expect the covid portfolio to moderate over the near-term, though continued roll-out of respiratory franchisee in the US and strong execution of One India strategy will help drive earnings growth over FY23-24,"" said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. Analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd have raised their EPS estimate by 6% and 4% for FY22 and FY23, factoring in strong traction in prescription and trade generics in the domestic formulations segment, extended benefits of cost savings and lower research and development spend."

Updated: 31 Jul 2021,FIIs cut stake in India's biggest companies in June quarter,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/fiis-cut-stake-in-india-s-biggest-companies-in-june-quarter-11627730607257.html,"MUMBAI: Institutional shareholding in India’s biggest listed companies reduced slightly in the three months ending June. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) holding in the Nifty 500 companies was down 60 basis points while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) stake slipped 10bps at the end of June quarter compared to preceding three months, based on data analysed by Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. Shareholding by FIIs in these set of companies was at 21.7% in June quarter compared to 22.3% Q1, but increased from 20.8% in June quarter of previous fiscal. Further analysis of the data showed that FIIs increased ownership in 52% of Nifty 500 companies but 54% of Nifty companies. Fear of rising virus cases during the second wave in India had spooked FIIs leading to massive sell-off of foreign funds in April. FIIs were net sellers of India equities worth $1.48 billion in April, first sell-off in the year, resulting into a total inflow of mere $757.72 million in June quarter. In June quarter, Nifty had jumped 7% while Nifty 500 was up over 9% while Nifty Bank rallied over 4%. Sectorwise, FIIs are significantly overweight in private banks/ non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and underweight in consumer, capital goods, metals, healthcare and PSU banks. “Financials has had a dominant run over the past few years. However, BFSI’s (private banks, NBFCs, insurance, and PSU banks) underperformance has continued to reflect in the FII allocation – down to 38% in the Nifty-500 as of June, from 45.1% in December 2019 and 40% in March 2020. This has resulted in the trimming of weight by 130 bps q-o-q (quarter-on-quarter),"" said Gautam Duggad, head of research - Institutional Equities, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Cipla, NTPC, M&M, Axis Bank, and IndusInd Bank were the top stocks to see an increase of more than 1% in FII holdings on a sequential basis. SBI Life Insurance, Hero MotoCorp, Adani Ports, Tech Mahindra, BPCL, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and ITC were the top stocks to see declines in FII holdings by more than 1% on a q-o-q basis. “While the near-term indicators are looking a little stretched for equities, the medium-term outlook for Indian equities remains attractive. We continue to expect some profit-booking especially by the foreign investors. While the June quarter earnings could be weak, the focus would shift to the outlook post June quarter results, which looks positive supported by the reopening of the economy. We continue to prefer mid-caps over large caps, albeit with a lower conviction now,"" Credit Suisse Wealth Management, India said in a note on 22 July. The FII-DII ownership ratio in the Nifty500 declined marginally to 1.5 times in Q1FY22 from 1.6 times in the previous quarter. Overall, the top five sectoral holdings of DIIs in the Nifty500 account for 65% of the total allocation – BFSI (27.4%), technology (11.8%), oil & gas (9.8%), consumer (9.7%), and healthcare (6.3%). There is a mixed trend in promoter holdings—an increase of 50bps q-o-q, down 50 bp year-on-year, data showed. Promoter stake in Coforge, Indian Bank, Union Bank, Crompton Greaves Consumer, TVS Motor, and HDFC Life Insurance declined on account of stake sales and capital raising exercises. Conversely, United Breweries, Vedanta, and Tata Motors posted an increase in promoter stake q-o-q."
