Kamath said historically geopolitical tensions have helped the US economy. He then asked what will happen to the economy amidst the current tension between Russia-Ukraine.   Data uploaded by Kamath on his Twitter account showed that among G20 countries, the US holds a 33% share of the global equity market cap followed by China which holds 10.97%, European Union holds 6.24%, while Japan held 5.20%, and Saudi Arabia holding 3.12%. These five countries account for a 58.53% share of the global equity market cap. India is at the sixth spot - accounting for 3.11% of the global market equity cap followed by Canada accounting for 3.03%, while France and the UK hold 2.82% each. Further, among G20 nations, China and India hold a major share of the global population at about 17.67% and 17.12% respectively. The US accounts for 4.16% of the global population, European Union holds 5.59%, and Japan accounting a 1.57% share of the global population. Kamath said, “All said and done; the US is still by far the biggest game around. Historically geopolitical tensions have helped the US economy."" adding ""what'll happen this time around?."" According to a Bloomberg report, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans a candid discussion about the war in Ukraine with his Chinese counterpart during an upcoming summit in Bali. A top Biden administration official earlier urged Beijing to stop spreading Russian “lies"" about the Kremlin’s invasion of its neighbor. Further, the report said, Blinken does not plan to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during the Group of 20 ministerial gathering in Bali this week. President Joe Biden has called for Russia to be removed from the G20 over the invasion and diplomats have previously walked out of a Lavrov speech in protest of the Kremlin’s war. Global markets have taken a massive hit since February last week when Kremlin carried out an all-out invasion of Ukraine. Since then, crude oil prices have spiked to multi-year high along with other commodity prices escalating inflation pressures that led to monetary policy tightening. The pandemic and supply chain disruption has further added to the global economy's woes. Concerns of a possible recession ahead have fuelled fears among investors that have pushed markets into a deep bearish tone since May. The uncertainty around the Russia - Ukraine conflict continues. G20 is a strategic multilateral platform connecting the world’s major developed and emerging economies. Notably, G20 members represent more than 80% of world GDP, 75% of international trade, and 60% of the world population. G20 countries are - Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union."

The portal will help retired personnel seeking re-employment to find an appropriate match by uploading their personal details on the WARB website along with their area of expertise and preferred employment location. ""With an aim to facilitate retired Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) and Assam Rifle personnel to secure employment with private security agencies, the Ministry of Home Affairs under the directions of the Union Home Minister,Amit Shah has launched ‘CAPF Punarvaas’, through the Welfare & Rehabilitation Board (WARB),"" according to a official press statement by MHA. The portal will help retired personnel seeking re-employment to find an appropriate match by uploading their personal details on the WARB website along with their area of expertise and preferred employment location. The Ministry of Home Affairs also runs a portal under Private Security Agencies Regulation Act (PSARA) for the registration of Private Security Agencies (PSAs). Welfare of CAPF personnel and their families has been one of the top priorities of the Government led by PM Narendra Modi. Both websites have now been interlinked whereby the database of retired CAPFs personnel who have applied on ‘CAPF Punarvaas’ can be accessed by PSAs through PSARA website resulting in a single platform for both job seekers and job providers. This new initiative of Ministry of Home Affairs provides access to the data base under ‘CAPFs Punarvaas’ to PSAs digitally. With the increase in the number of business establishments requiring security services, there has been a substantial growth of PSAs thereby increasing the requirement of security personnel. On the one hand, PSAs will benefit by accessing the database of retired and willing personnel of CAPFs who are well trained in providing security and other security related services; on the other hand this initiative will provide an electronic platform for retired CAPFs personnel to secure employment in PSAs. This initiative is a step towards the welfare of CAPFs personnel and will go a long way in meeting their rehabilitation requirements."

Overnight, risk aversion swept away a relief rally after the US Fed raised interest rates by the most since 2000 but pushed back against talk of super-sized increases. Markets will remain volatile until there is a clear picture of Fed rate policy and its trajectory   Indian equity markets closed deep in the red on Friday, in line with global peers, on worries over interest rate hikes and inflation. Globally, stocks slid as risk aversion and volatility gripped markets beset by inflation and growth fears. U.S. futures dropped, signalling extended losses after Thursday’s slide of more than 3.5% in the S&P 500 index and 5% in the Nasdaq 100 gauge.  Back home, benchmark Sensex fell 866.65 points, or 1.56%, to end the day at 54,835.58, and Nifty was down 271.40 points at 16,411.30.  Among sectors, IT, metal, and realty indices fell 2-3%. BSE midcap and smallcap indices fell 2% each.   Despite volatile demand and raw material prices, it expects margins to remain at the current level in FY23 through price hikes, judicious A&P spend, and cost optimization. Maintain BUY with revised TPD of ₹620 (vs earlier TP of ₹680) as we continue to value it at 49x FY24E, implying an upside of 17% from the CMP.   Online food aggregator and delivery platform Zomato’s co-founder and chief executive officer Deepinder Goyal said he is donating the entire proceeds worth ₹700 crore ($90 million) received after vesting some of his employee stock option plans (ESOPs) to Zomato Future Foundation (ZFF). Goyal was granted some ESOPs before Zomato went public last year and some of the ESOPs were vested last month, said Goyal in a statement. There’s a minimum one year vesting required as per law.   Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Friday said India will be able to conclude a free trade agreement (FTA) with the European Union by next year. Speaking at an event organised by the IMC Chamber of Commerce, Goyal said the country has already sealed pacts with the UAE and Australia, and is in negotiations with other countries or blocs including the EU, UK, Canada and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). “By next year, we would be able to conclude an FTA with the EU,"" Goyal said, adding that a delegation from Italy including its foreign minister is in New Delhi now with which he will be having deliberations.   Europe's stock markets fell on Friday in a global selloff rooted in worries over rising interest rates and surging inflation. London's benchmark FTSE 100 index dropped 0.5% to 7,467.66 points, one day after the Bank of England hiked interest rates to a 13-year peak and highlighted UK recession risks. In the eurozone, Frankfurt's DAX index shed 0.8% to 13,793.22 points and the Paris CAC 40 lost 1.2% to 6,293.10.   Russia's Rosneft sold 700,000 tonnes of Urals oil loading from Baltic ports of Primorsk and Ust-Luga in May to Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the country's top refiner, two traders familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. Rosneft allocated seven cargoes of 100,000 tonnes each loading between May 15 and 31 to IOC, according to the traders. In May IOC will load Rosneft-sourced Urals oil volumes from Baltic ports for the first time. Previously the major buyers of the cargoes were trading firms Vitol and Trafigura. However, international traders will stop purchases of oil from Rosneft after May 15 as EU sanctions over several Russian companies come into effect. Last December IOC and Rosneft signed a term contract for supply of up to 2 million tonnes of Urals oil until the end of 2022.   World food prices eased slightly in April after hitting a record high in March, but global food security remained a concern because of the difficult market conditions, U.N. food agency said on Friday. The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 158.5 points last month versus an upwardly revised 159.7 for March. The March figure was previously put at 159.3.   Angel One expanded its client base to 9.64 million in April, a 118.1% YoY growth. The company’s gross client acquisition for the month stood at 0.44 million, a 41.5% YoY increase. The 66.14 million orders, a 65.7% YoY rise, in April 2022 indicates the high level of client activity on the company’s platform.   Macro Factors & Earnings Continue to Weigh On Market Sentiments: April has exhibited a rather mixed performance across all sectoral, market cap, and style indices, which indicate some change in the underlying market regime. Though some recovery was seen in the equity market after a major selloff on 24th February, the trend is likely to be range-bound moving forward.  During the month, Commodities, Energy, Auto and FMCG indices performed well while IT and Media indices reported a significant decline. While Small Caps suffered the most, they also recovered from the 24th Feb’22 bottom rather swiftly. Nifty 50 has recovered 5% since the 24th Feb’22 sell-off. On a positive note, the broader market witnessed a much faster recovery over the same period with Mid and Small Caps recovering by 11% and 13% respectively.  The prevailing geopolitical developments are likely to continue being at the centre stage for some more time before it concludes in a more concrete direction. The market will also continue to eye on rising Covid-19 cases and the impact of lockdown in China. Consequently, its performance is likely to be range-bound in the near term. We believe most of the CY22 returns are expected to be back-loaded and H2CY22 is likely to be less volatile than H1CY22. Keeping these developments in perspective, we value it at 22x FY24E earnings and maintain our Dec’22 NIFTY50 target of 20200 unchanged.   State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has won 18 of 21 areas offered for finding and producing oil and gas in the sixth bid round under Open Acreage Licensing Policy, according to upstream regulator DGH.

India has evoked an emergency law in a bid to start generation at some idle power plants running on imported coal which are not producing power because of financial stress or due to high international prices of coal, the government said on Friday. India is facing its worst power crisis in over six years, and officials have been scrambling to arrange supply for power plants whose pre-summer inventories are at over nine year lows and as power demand is set to rise at the fastest pace in at least 38 years. Over 43% of the plants fired by imported coal, which have a total capacity of 17.6 gigawatts (GW) and account for 8.6% of India's total coal power capacity, are currently idle. Officials have also decided to invoke an emergency clause in the country's electricity law to allow the plants to run.

Gross margin improved 40bps/80bps YoY/QoQ. Higher gross margin QoQ indicates superior product mix. EBIDTA margin came in at 16% with higher A&P and other expenses. However ad spends lower by 9% QoQ. We maintain our BUY rating with revised PT of ₹603 based on 45x FY24E EPS.   India is looking to boost its coal output by 75-100 million tonnes in the next two-to-three years by restarting closed mines, the country's coal secretary A K Jain said on Friday. India, the world's second largest producer, importer and consumer of coal, produced 777.2 million tonnes of the fuel during the year ended March 2022 and burnt over a billion tonnes. State-run Coal India, the world's largest coal miner, which produces 80% of India's coal, plans to increase annual output to 1 billion tonnes by 2024, from 622.6 million tonnes currently.   Indian shares dropped nearly 2% on Friday and were set for their worst week since November, as investors fretted that fast-paced interest rate hikes to tame surging inflation would slow global economic growth. At 1115am, the benchmark was Sensex was at 54,669.77, down 1,032.46 points, 1.85%, while Nifty fell 314.05 points to 16,368.60.

So far this week, foreign investors have net sold Indian equities worth $635 million, compared with $881 million offloaded in the same period last week, according to Refinitiv data.   An Indian court has put on hold a federal enforcement agency's decision to seize $725 million from local bank accounts of China's Xiaomi Corp for suspected violations of foreign exchange laws, two sources told Reuters on Friday. The Enforcement Directorate last week seized the bank assets of Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited, saying it had found the company illegally remitted funds to three foreign-based entities, including one Xiaomi group entity, ""in the guise of royalty"" payments. Xiaomi had denied any wrongdoing, saying its ""royalty payments and statements to the bank are all legit and truthful"". It later filed a challenge against the Indian financial crime fighting agency's decision in the High Court of the southern Karnataka state.   Standing firm – reiterate as preferred bet among two wheelers TVSL 4QFY22 were largely in-line to our/street estimates. EBITDA margins over last few quarters (ex of 1Q) have been strong at >10% despite multiple headwinds. With volume recovery over low base, we expect margins to expand by 80bp/30bp at 10.2%/10.5% for FY23E/24E. TVSL currently trades at 23x/19x of FY23/24 EPS (v/s HMCL at ~15x/12.9x and BJAUT of 17x/14.5x). We believe it should continue to trade at a premium as we expect EPS CAGR of ~31% over FY22-24E. EV focus continues to intensify with more capex/investments towards the same. We believe sustained market share gains in domestic EV 2Ws led by aggressive product pipeline, scope of external investments in to EV vertical and NBFC TVS credit are additional re-rating triggers. We re-iterate TVS as our preferred pick among 2W names with BUY and TP of Rs779 (v/s Rs789) with FY23/24 estimates tweaked marginally.   The volatility was clearly on the higher side and the way we concluded the weekly expiry, certainly does not bode well for the bulls. But we reiterate, that we would avoid getting carried away by this; because we believe markets are a bit oversold and the last two days’ move could be a deceptive one. Hence, rather than jumping into this, we would stay on the sidelines and would assess the situation for the next 2 – to 3 days.  As far as levels are concerned, 16600-16500 are to be treated as immediate supports, while 16900-17000 has now become a sturdy wall.    Indian equity markets fell over 1% on Friday, tracking a decline in Asian peers as U.S. stocks fell sharply overnight on worries the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike this week may not be enough to help fight surging inflation. All sectoral indices were in the red, with IT, metal, realty indices down 2% each. At 10am, Sensex was down 838.13 points, or 1.50%, at 54,864.10, Nifty fell 259.70 points to 16423. The benchmark indexes looked set to fall for a fourth straight week.   Strong Growth and market share gains in core business in tough environment Aggressive towards expansion/innovation via ecommerce We are maintaining our EPS estimate of 11.5/13.8 for FY23/24 on expectations of strong growth in drinks, beverages and foods, IBD & increasing share of e-commerce innovations. We expect near-term growth pressures given input cost inflation, slowdown in rural demand & overall decline in discretionary consumption. However, we remain positive on long term outlook given 1) Innovation led growth strategy, 2) Increasing share in foods & beverages category 3) LUP Innovations allowing DABUR to leverage its distribution 4) Cost saving initiatives and 6) Strong rural distribution coverage of 90k villages (30k added in FY22) 7) 4-5% incremental sales every year from ecommerce innovations. Dabur remains a formidable play on recovery in rural demand in coming quarters. Dabur trades at 38.2x FY24 EPS with 16% EPS CAGR over FY22-24 and 24% ROE and 50% dividend payout. Retain accumulate with 12 month DCF based target price of Rs603 (unchanged).   Packaged-goods companies Dabur India and Marico Ltd pointed to weak rural demand in the March quarter as consumers downgraded to cheaper packs and brands in categories such as toothpaste to hair oil and shampoos as surging inflation chipped away at their spending power.

The central education board said this time, only the theory performance of students is being communicated to the students. ""The information about practical or project or internal assessment is already with the schools,"" it added. Being Term-1 only, no mark sheet cum passing certificate is being issued now. “Only one mark sheet cum passing certificate will be issued after Term-2 exam to have parity with the previous results. This will be comprised of total marks of both the terms as per weightage decided of Term-1 and Term-2 exams,"" the CBSE said. To address the difficulty level between two sets of question papers in the Term-1 exam, a needful action will be taken while preparing the final result, the CBSE said. The weightage of Term-1 and Term-2 will be decided at the time of declaration of Term-2 result and accordingly, the final performance will be calculated, it said. The result of Class 10 will also be declared only after the Term-2 exam wherein the candidates will be placed in the essential repeat or compartment or pass category. The CBSE has said no exam centre will be changed in the Term-2 exam. Students will appear only from the centres allotted to their school. The compartment exam will be conducted based on the syllabus of the Term-22 exams. Board shares Class 10 results to schools: The CBSE has communicated the results of the Term-1 exams for Class 10 to the schools. The CBSE board informed that only theory marks have been communicated to the schools as internal assessment scores are already available with the schools. Taking to Twitter, the CBSE board wrote, ""Performance of Term 1 exam of class X has been communicated to the schools by CBSE. Only scores, in theory, have been communicated as internal Assessment /practical scores are already available with the schools"". For the first time, CBSE decided to conduct Class 10 and Class papers in two parts: Term-1 and Term-2, respectively. The Term-1 exams for Class 10 were held between November 30 and December 11 last year. The exams were based on Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs). Candidates can also use apps like Digilocker and Umang can also be used to check the results for Term 1.

Updated: 05 Mar 2022,UPL in merger talks with 2 American cos,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/upl-in-merger-talks-with-2-american-cos-11646419877995.html,"UPL Ltd’s founding Shroff family is exploring a merger with at least two American firms—CF Industries Holdings Inc. and FMC Corp.—as part of the family’s plan to ensure a fair distribution of businesses and assets among its members, two people aware of the discussions said. Mumbai-based UPL, valued at around ₹55,000 crore, is one of the largest agrochemicals companies in the world. The company produces industrial chemicals, chemical intermediates and speciality chemicals and offers crop protection solutions. The promoters of UPL are considering several options but leaning towards a merger because it may fetch much better value for their 28.24% stake and public shareholders, one of the two people cited above said, seeking anonymity. “A merger at this stage is likely to fetch at least a 15% premium to UPL’s current worth, which translates to around $8.9 billion or ₹63,000 crore—the largest deal in the agrochemicals space in Asia, if formalized,"" said the first person. A spokesperson for UPL denied talks of a potential merger with FMC Corp. or CF Industries. UPL has hired investment bank Evercore Group LLC to advise the promoters on the best option and whether a merger deal would benefit members of the promoter family and public shareholders. Goldman Sachs, too, has been hired by one of the two American firms to explore a merger or takeover in India. A Goldman Sachs spokesperson declined to comment. UPL is currently overseen by octogenarian chairman and founder Rajnikant Devidas Shroff. He started the business as a manufacturer of mercury salts at a British plant. The chairman’s elder son, Jai, is the CEO of UPL, while his younger brother, Vikram, serves as a member on the company’s board. The two American firms are keen on expanding their footprint, and all the three companies are laying stress on ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance), clean energy and sustainability-oriented business processes, the two people said. CF Industries Holdings is a leading manufacturer of hydrogen and nitrogen products. Responding to an email from Mint, Chris Close, a US-based spokesperson at CF Industries, said, “CF Industries does not comment on market speculation."" Philadelphia-based FMC Corp. is a global agricultural sciences firm that helps growers produce food, fibre and fuel apart from providing crop protection solutions. Replying to an email on a potential deal with UPL, FMC spokesperson Lars Weborg said, “FMC does not comment on industry rumours or speculation."" If the merger plan goes through, “the shortlisted entity (CF Industries or FMC) may own a majority stake in the merged entity while the Shroff family may hold a minority stake. Since a large number of shares are held by public shareholders, UPL promoters may look for buyback of shares from the market to make any potential merger process easier,"" said the first person. The board of UPL on Thursday approved a buyback proposal. On Friday, while the benchmark Sensex closed down by 1.4%, UPL’s stock was only marginally down by 0.17% to ₹713.5. The stock has gained about 3% since the buyback was announced. An email to Evercore Group remained unanswered. UPL offers a range of fertilizers and agricultural chemicals, including herbicides, insecticides and seed treatments. It also sells other products used to stimulate plant growth, store crops, conserve water, and a line of disease-resistant seed varieties. In 2018, UPL acquired Arysta LifeScience Inc. for $4.2 billion in a deal that transformed the company into one of the world’s largest generic agrochemicals firms."

Indian air passengers are price sensitive and airlines often find it difficult to raise fares steeply. Eveready Industries: The company's chairman and managing director quit on Thursday amid an intensifying takeover bid by the Burmans of Dabur. The resignations of Aditya Khaitan and Amritanshu Khaitan came two days after the Burmans made an open offer for the Kolkata-based dry cell battery major.

Updated: 02 Mar 2022,Super 15: Stocks benefitting from rising popularity of ESG theme ,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/super-15-stock-benefitting-from-rising-popularity-of-esg-theme-11646195130371.html,"In a post-Covid world, conscious investing has gained lot of traction among investors. In fact, in 2021, at a global platform, India made a commitment to reach net carbon zero by 2070. With the environment, social and governance (ESG) theme fast catching-up, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd have outlined key considerations for investors and picked stocks from five sectors to bet on this theme. They are as follows: 1) Coal Sector: The fundamental question for India's transition is linked to its coal sector. Ensuring a well-planned and just transition away from coal will be a significant challenge, with both risks and opportunities in the power sector and beyond. With around 8% of state revenue from coal activities, diversification of the economy is needed. Coal India Ltd will be central to the transition. The company has already taken steps to diversify into renewable power, with three gigawatts of planned solar capacity to FY24. Natural gas is also set to play a significant role in displacing coal. GAIL India Ltd operates around 220 mmsmd (million metric standard cubic meter per day) of pipeline capacity and is the largest LNG trader in India. 2) Agriculture accounts for around 20% of India's greenhouse gas emissions and is the main source of non-carbon dioxide related emissions. Opportunities exist for investors through chemical free farming and low-cost solutions which improve irrigation and energy efficiency. UPL Ltd will likely play a central role in decarbonisation efforts. Through various projects, it is driving the adoption of digital solutions and increased penetration of bio-solutions. 3) Road Transport: With auto demand set to grow to 2040, an uptake in electric power-trains is an important area of focus for policy-makers. Tata Motors Ltd leads the local market with nearly 7% market share. Bajaj Auto Ltd, TVS Motor Company Ltd & Hero MotoCorp Ltd are actively expanding their electric vehicles portfolios. 4) Power Utilities: State-run distribution companies will underpin India's energy transition. Their financial fragility however currently inhibits their appetite for investment and transformation of the power grid. NTPC Ltd should be a key beneficiary of new renewable capacity given its access to low cost funding. Power Grid Corporation of India, Larsen & Toubro Ltd, Siemens Ltd and KEI International Ltd could all see tailwinds from increased transmission and distribution spend. 5) Heavy Industry: Heavy industry's share of energy consumption has increased to 42%, making it the largest end user of energy. Incumbents are focused on renewable power with Shree Cement Ltd, The Ramco Cements Ltd and Ultratech Cement Ltd all active in this regard."

Amid the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, several airlines are operating special flights, including Air India, to bring back Indian nationals safely. According to the authorities of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, Mumbai, the airport has blocked a special corridor for Indians arriving from Ukraine later today. They will be required to produce either a Covid-19 vaccination certificate/negative RT-PCR report on arrival. However, in case any passenger is not able to show any of the documents at the time of arrival, they will have to undergo RT-PCR testing at the airport, where the cost would be borne by the airport.

Updated: 24 Feb 2022,Russia Ukraine crisis: Ukraine computers hit by data-wiping software,https://www.livemint.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-crisis-ukraine-computers-hit-by-data-wiping-software-11645659896018.html,"Russia Ukraine crisis: A newly discovered piece of destructive software found circulating in Ukraine has hit hundreds of computers, according to researchers at the cybersecurity firm ESET, part of what Ukrainian officials said was an intensifying wave of hacks aimed at the country. In a series of statements posted to Twitter, the company said that the data wiping program had been ""installed on hundreds of machines in the country,"" an attack it said had likely been in the works for the past couple of months. Vikram Thakur of cybersecurity firm Symantec, which is also looking into the attacks, told Reuters that infections had spread widely. ""We see activity across Ukraine and Latvia,"" Thakur said. A Symantec spokesperson later added Lithuania. Who is responsible for the wiper is unclear, although suspicion immediately fell on Russia, which has repeatedly been accused of launching data-scrambling hacks against Ukraine and other countries. Russia has denied the allegations. Ukraine has already been repeatedly hit by hackers in the past few weeks as Russia has massed troops around its borders. Fears of a full-scale invasion rose after Moscow this week ordered troops to two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine. Cybersecurity experts are racing to pick apart the malicious program, a copy of which was uploaded to the Alphabet-owned crowdsourced cybersecurity site VirusTotal, to see what its capabilities were. Researchers found that the wiping software appeared to have been digitally signed with a certificate issued to an obscure Cypriot company called Hermetica Digital Ltd. Because operating systems use code-signing as an initial check on software, such a certificate might have been designed to help the rogue program dodge anti-virus protections. Getting such a certificate under false pretences - or stealing it - isn't impossible, but it's generally the sign of a ""sophisticated and targeted"" operator, said Brian Kime, a vice president at U.S. cybersecurity firm ZeroFox. Contact details for Hermetica - which was set up in the Cypriot capital, Nicosia, almost a year ago, were not immediately available. The company did not appear to have a website. Earlier on Wednesday the websites of Ukraine's government, foreign ministry and state security service were down in what the government said was the start of another denial of service (DDoS) attack. ""At about 4 pm, another mass DDoS attack on our state began. We have relevant data from a number of banks,"" said Mykhailo Fedorov, Minister of Digital Transformation, adding that the parliament website was also hit. He did not mention which banks were affected and the central bank could not immediately be reached for comment. In a statement, Ukraine's data protection watchdog said that hacks were on the upswing. ""Phishing attacks on public authorities and critical infrastructure, the spread of malicious software, as well as attempts to penetrate private and public sector networks and further destructive actions have intensified,"" it said in an email. Last week, the online networks of Ukraine's defence ministry and two banks were overwhelmed in a separate intrusion. The U.S. company Netscout Systems Inc later said the impact had been modest. U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, speaking to Reuters before news of the wiper was made public, said the denial of services actions against Ukraine were still ""well short of what Russia could potentially unleash.""

Globally, testing strategies are being reassessed in the context of Omicron’s lower health risk and service capacities crunched by strict quarantine norms. We should indeed capture cases as accurately as possible, but not at the cost of people in need going untested, which Mumbai’s new rules could result in.

He also stated that that the second bidder was a consortium led by the owner of SpiceJet. However, because the company is facing insolvency proceedings in the Madras High Court, it was not eligible to offer and so there was just one bidder. Earlier on 4 Jan, while arguing, Tushar Mehta who was representing the Centre said that the disinvestment was a policy choice made in light of Air India's massive losses. According to Mehta, the government decided in 2017 that regardless of when the disinvestment occurs, the government will cover the losses up to that point. Following which the bidder was to bear the losses. So the decision was not taken to help any particular party, he added. SpiceJet was never a part of the consortium and therefore, the proceedings against it are irrelevant to the divestment process, he clarified."
