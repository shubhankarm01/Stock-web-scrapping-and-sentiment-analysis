Updated: 04 Jul 2022,‘SBI to use analytics to track emerging stress across sectors’,https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/sbi-to-use-analytics-to-track-emerging-stress-across-sectors-11656874227527.html,"MUMBAI : State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender, wants to use granular data generated in its branches every day to predict stress and pre-emptively act to shield its balance sheet. Accordingly, the state-owned lender is looking at ways to use advanced analytics to sift through data and find patterns that indicate incipient stress. In an interview, Ashwini Kumar Tewari, managing director in charge of risk, compliance, and stressed assets at SBI, explained how the bank digitized some stressed asset management processes. Edited excerpts: What kind of stress are you seeing among retail and small business borrowers? Most of our retail customers are salaried; therefore, we do not see any challenge. Our non-salaried set, though small, is facing some stress, but the net number taken together is quite under control. While the cashflows to the micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) segment were clearly impacted but our lending parameters to this segment are very stringent. We do not give them an equivalent loan amount as salaried borrowers, and the loan-to-value is also lower. Even in the salaried segment, people lost jobs and had their salaries cut, but since we do not go down to the low credit score profiles, our overall experience in covid-19 has not been adverse. Has technology helped turnaround time in stressed asset resolution? For one-time settlement and compromise, we have an open platform where a person can apply online instead of coming to a branch. Internally we have a dashboard to track this at the operational level as well as the management level. We are thus able to control the turnaround time and see the quantum of recoveries. The legal team is a major component of the stressed assets vertical. We have an application called the Litigation Management System with modules such as the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), the debt recovery tribunal, and courts. Here, the entire case history is available and provides reminders for documents that come up for renewal for the next hearing, among other things. We have also digitized the wilful defaulter management system. What are some of the new technology initiatives your department has planned? We have so much data in the system. It would be useful to leverage this data not only from the risk perspective but also to see how things are moving in real-time in various parts of the country and different sectors. This is one area where we would like to use artificial intelligence and machine learning. Right now, our analytical teams are embedded in the risk, products divisions and operational risk areas. We get all the non-performing asset (NPA) data from across the country, including individual account data, and the aggregation happens at the circle level. Say there are problems in the steel sector in a particular state; one way to know is to track media reports but is our database showing impending stress from that region? After it becomes NPA, it will have to be dealt with, but if there are early indicators of stress, then this can be handled proactively. Do you think it is faster to resolve stressed loans outside the purview of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)? In a few cases where we realized that getting upfront cash is important and the process itself may take a long time, it is better to sell to asset reconstruction companies.I believe there are certain changes being contemplated in IBC. If they happen, like pre-pack insolvency for corporates, we may have some more cases handled better. Everyone talks about the highlighted cases, but the smaller cases of ₹5 lakh or ₹10 lakh are not in the media. There are cases from branches in tier 3 and tier 4 cities which are seeing very good recovery."

Invariably we have seen that during inflationary conditions gold is one of the preferred asset classes and that means there is traction for gold loans too,"" said Khara, adding that the bank has a 24% market share in gold loans. Khara said that in first quarter of FY23, SBI saw decent traction in gold loans and much better growth compared to what it witnessed in the same period in the past. “I expect that in the current year (FY23), we should be in a position to grow well in this segment,"" he said. On retail loan growth, Khara said it continues to be an important engine for the public sector lender. “(Going by) the way it has grown in the past, we expect that we should be in a position to ride the growth potential available in the retail segment,"" he said. However, it does not mean that other opportunities are not available in terms of the asset growth, he said, adding that there is demand from the corporates, small businesses and also in the international book.

We seem to be nearing a trough in the asset-quality cycle and provisioning levels appear demonstrably sufficient. Capitalisation for sector-leading large private banks is more than adequate in our view,"" it said in a note on Indian banks. BNP Paribas thinks deposit flows have entrenched a lot of cost-stability advantages that larger banks enjoy. Valuations, while not a bargain, are not in the highest reaches of trading bands either. BNP Paribas' top stock picks - HDFC Bank: The global brokerage believes recent headwinds on tech investment news flow create a special opportunity in HDFC Bank as its traditional strengths (CASA tailwinds, best-in-class asset quality) are being somewhat discounted. Its Buy tag on HDFC Bank shares comes with a target price of ₹1,710. ICICI Bank: ICICI Bank remains a play on credit revival with high provisioning levels, tech investments and continued CASA mobilization, it said with target price of ₹890.  Axis Bank: “We choose Axis Bank for the valuation headroom it offers as well as gearing to a credit cycle recovery through both asset quality and loan growth. Our comfort with AXSB’s provision levels is as high as what we have for ICICIBC’s but recognise that a lower CASA and higher cost of funds ensure that higher rates do not confer an equal amount of competitive benefits on it as on HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank,"" the note stated.

All residents, including minors, are eligible to apply for the scheme through a single or joint method, according to SBI's official website.

An overdraft/loan of up to 75% of the balance amount of the annuity can be issued for specific circumstances such as education, marriage, or any other emergency. According to SBI, annuity payments will be credited to the loan account only after the OD/loan has been disbursed."

Updated: 03 Jun 2022,"Battle for deposits, coming soon to the branch network",https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/battle-for-deposits-coming-soon-to-the-branch-network-11654192868819.html,"MUMBAI : With the era of easy money drawing to a close, banks are turning their attention back to fixed deposits. There is a difference this time, though -- instead of chasing the same set of customers with higher deposit rates, banks are ramping up their branch networks and sprucing up service quality to attract new customers. India’s largest private sector bank HDFC Bank has said it plans to open 2,000 branches every year for the next three years to refinance HDFC’s borrowings after their merger, and also to finance incremental growth. However, it has also said that its deposit mobilization strategy will be distribution-driven, and not rates-led. State Bank of India, India’s largest lender with 22,266 branches, is also looking at fine-tuning its strategy on customer acquisition and sharpening focus on deposits. “Our franchise is strong. Branches always help in acquisition of deposits. While savings bank (deposits) can be acquired through digital channels, fixed deposits are acquired mainly through branches,"" said C.S. Setty, managing director, SBI. According to him, banks can compete only to some extent on pricing, and competing only with interest rates will put margins under pressure. “There will definitely be an increase in deposit rates to take care of the inflationary expectations of people, but not to merely compete for deposits. SBI has not seen any pressure on growth of deposits, and growth rate has been in tune with industry growth rates. Our focus continues to be to improve service quality which, combined with the trust our brand enjoys, will help us improve our strong market share in deposits. A strong network of customer service points through bank mitras is also helping us,"" Setty said. Bank mitras help bring banking services such as loans and deposits to primarily unbanked areas. With HDFC Bank looking to double its branch count over the next 3-4 years, rivals are also reworking their strategies. Last week, Kotak Mahindra Bank unveiled a new strategy for its digital neobank Kotak811 under the leadership of founder Uday Kotak’s son Jay Kotak. This digital product had led to the opening of 12.3 million fully digital savings accounts since its launch in 2017. However, its monthly active users stand at 6.2 million, accounting for just half of its overall customer base. The bank is now focusing on increasing engagement with the 811 user base as it looks to cross-sell more products. Separately, the bank has also announced an internal competition among employees for opening the highest number of accounts. Axis Bank is also raising its game on digital capabilities by tying up with fintechs to open deposit accounts. The bank, which expects 10% of liabilities inflow through digital channels, is also reviewing its internal strategy to face competition. “HDFC Bank is going to be a disruptor. We can’t stay quiet as branches are an important lever for liabilities growth, and are therefore looking to revise our branch expansion policy,"" a top executive at Axis Bank said on condition of anonymity. However, analysts said banks will still lock horns over deposit rates this year. Some such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Federal Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank, have hiked deposit rates by 25 basis points after the Reserve Bank of India increased repo rate by 40 basis points at an off-cycle meeting in May. With the increase in cash reserve ratio (CRR) taking effect on 21 May, liquidity surplus in the system has come down. According to RBI data, the daily liquidity absorption from the banking system was ₹2.96 trillion on 31 May, down from ₹3.22 trillion on 20 May – a day before the CRR hike came into effect. About a month ago, liquidity absorption from the system was over ₹5 trillion. “With reducing liquidity surplus in the banking system and strong credit growth, deposit rates will continue to see upward pressure. Competition from the expected increase in small savings rate will also push banks to offer higher deposit rates,"" said Anil Gupta, vice president, ICRA. Bank deposits in India stood at ₹167 trillion in the fortnight ended 6 May, registering stable growth of 9.7% over the previous year. Meanwhile, in absolute terms, bank deposits have increased by ₹14.8 trillion in the last 12 months. Bank credit continued to see strong growth at 11.9% year-on-year. In absolute terms, credit outstanding crossed ₹120 trillion on 6 May, expanding by ₹12.8 trillion in the last 12 months."

Updated: 16 May 2022,"Futile to blame central banks, 59% rise in inflation due to geopolitics: Report",https://www.livemint.com/economy/futile-to-blame-central-banks-59-rise-in-inflation-due-to-geopolitics-report-11652685705274.html,"A research report from the State Bank of India’s Economic Research Department says that at least 59% of the increase in inflation is because of geo-political conflict, and it is futile to blame central banks.  The report has been authored by Dr. Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser, State Bank of India. Here are the key highlights from the report. Inflation continues to be a bugbear and it looks unlikely that it will correct anytime soon. The latest inflation numbers however reveal that while in the rural areas, the impact has been disproportionately higher for food prices, in urban areas it is disproportionately higher as far as fuel price impact and pass through is concerned since the war began, as per the report. We did a dipstick study to understand the exclusive impact of war on inflation trajectory in both the rural and urban areas. Using February as the base case (the beginning of the Ukraine and Russia conflict), our study reveals that because of war alone, Food and Beverages (assuming that vegetable price increase was mostly because of seasonal factors, that are largely domestic) and Fuel and Light & Transport contributed 52% of the increase in overall inflation since February. If we also add the impact of input costs particularly on the FMCG sector, thus adding the contribution of personal care and effects, the total impact at all India level comes to 59%, purely because of war. Against the continued increase in inflation, it is now almost certain that RBI will raise rates in forthcoming June and August policy and will take it to pre-pandemic level of 5.15% by August. However, the important challenge facing the central bank remains whether inflation will tread down meaningfully because of such rate hikes if war related disruptions do not subside quickly. In particular, as retail loans are benchmarked to an external rate (mostly to RBI’s repo rate) with quarterly reset clause, so the interest rate on loans benchmarked to repo rate will increase directly with the increase in repo rate. As of Dec’2021, around 39.2% of the loans are benchmarked to external benchmarks, so the increase in repo rate will eventually increase interest cost. In a situation of incipient demand recovery post Covid, the question will be whether growth could be a large casualty in case of large and persistent rate increases, even as inflation prints will continue to be of serious concern. As per the report, it is noteworthy that transmission to lending rates since October 2019 reveals that even as repo rate was cut by 140 basis points, the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans declined by more than 186 basis points. This was one of the primary reasons for significant jump in credit impulses during pandemic, apart from financial stability concerns being addressed eloquently by RBI through using yield curve as a public good. The current turbulence in a way mirrors such conundrum the RBI faced while navigating through the pandemic as larger rate hikes to quell inflation might have an impact on nascent growth impulses. Also, the RBI may have to use a shorter window to address inflationary concerns given the realpolitik challenges in the not so distant horizon. We thus must support RBI in its endeavour to quell inflation through hikes in interest rates. A higher interest rate will be also positive for the financial system as risks will get repriced. The situation is different than during the global financial crisis wherein the lending started increasing aggressively from March 2009 onwards much before the rate hike cycle began (Mar’2010 till March’2012). Currently, the rate hike cycle has begun and now the bank lending will increase according to the adequate risk pricing and demand. Interestingly, retail personal loans have grown at a scorching pace of 23.1% in FY22 with an interest rate that is much higher than home loan rates which are EBLR linked rates. Additionally, Household Leverage as a % of GDP has now declined to 31.8% of GDP in March 2022 from a high of 37.2% in March 2021, said the report. There is one point of caution though. Indian inflation internals are much different than those of advanced economies such as the US. Building wage pressures mirrored in the multi-decadal high annual wage growth are fueling broad-based price pressures across all advanced economies. In contrast, in India nominal rural wages for both agricultural and non-agricultural labourers picked up during H2 FY22, with easing of restrictions/lockdowns imposed by states and restoration in economic activity. However, the wage growth has remained soft. The weighted contribution of wage growth in CPI build-up remains modest. Thus, even after rate hikes, inflation will take time to moderate in India. We also strongly recommend that the RBI may intervene in the NDF market instead of the onshore market through Banks during Indian time zone as this has the benefit of not impacting rupee liquidity. This will also save the foreign exchange reserves, with only settlement of differential amount with counterparties on maturity dates, said the report."
Updated: 14 May 2022,SBI bets on corporate credit pick up to drive growth in FY23,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/sbi-bets-on-corporate-credit-pickup-to-drive-growth-in-fy23-11652444404393.html,"MUMBAI : State Bank of India (SBI) expects corporate credit to pick up this year, thanks to fresh investments in infrastructure projects by the government and renewed demand from large borrowers. “We are quite hopeful that in the coming days, the environment would be conducive to corporate credit growth,"" Dinesh Khara, chairman of SBI, said after announcing the bank’s March quarter earnings. Considering the bank’s unutilized portion of working capital limits and term loans and loan proposals in the pipeline, the bank has visibility on the credit of about ₹4.6 trillion. Companies are already utilizing a larger portion of their working capital limits sanctioned by the bank, at 56% now, with the demand for corporate credit picking pace from the December quarter. “We are seeing much better capacity utilization in terms of the working capital,"" Khara said. On Friday, the bank reported a profit of ₹9,114 crore in the three months through March, up 41.3% from a year earlier. This was driven by a 15.3% growth in net interest income, or the difference between interest earned and expended. The bank’s domestic net interest margin (NIM), a key measure of profitability, stood at 3.4%, unchanged from the previous quarter. SBI’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs) were at 3.97% of its total loan book, down from 4.5% in the December quarter. “Wherever we had the slightest doubt, we have already provided for. So I do not think we would have any surprises coming from NPAs,"" Khara said. On Friday, the bank’s shares fell 3.76% to ₹445.05 on BSE. In the March quarter, corporate loans grew 6.35% from the previous year to ₹8.7 trillion as of 31 March. The bank’s credit growth is still being led by the retail segment, which has now expanded to ₹10.02 trillion as of 31 March. That said, the large infrastructure capex push by the government in the FY23 Union budget is expected to restart the private capex cycle, improving loan growth prospects. “We have already sanctioned for ports and airports and are going to finance a lot of infrastructure-related activities,"" Khara said, adding that as long as there is demand in the economy, there is bound to be investments. Last year, Khara said, India witnessed significant growth in exports and sectors such as textiles, where there used to be hardly any activity. “The way things are evolving this year, I think it is going to be a scenario where there will be demand for all infrastructure requirements. We are quite hopeful of strong demand from the corporate side and also from small and medium enterprises (SMEs),"" he said. In fact, Khara does not see the rising interest rates dampening demand. He said that an internal study by the bank has found that interest costs for any corporate vary from 8% to 15% of their total expenses. In a scenario where this cost increases 100 basis points (bps), corporates borrowing at 8% interest would still borrow at about 9%. “If there is a demand, th"

The officials have said that the machines will be equipped with a software that has pre-loaded offences and fines corresponding to these violations. The public can make the payment either via debit or credit cards or through UPI. The new system will be rolled out by Monday, the officials said. ""This is a Millennium City and has many violators who are just passing through or from other cities. We had long been getting feedbacks and complaints about people having to go to the traffic tower for payment. This (on spot payment) will be very convenient for both officers on duty and violators,"" Ravinder Tomar, DCP (Traffic), Gururgam, said. It also ensures transparency, he added.

Meanwhile, in another development, the smart city division of GMDA has started a pilot project on the Basai-Dundahera 1,200 mm pipeline to allay the water woes of the residents this summer. The project involves use of a Centralised Integrated Water Management System (CIWMS) on the 1,200 mm pipeline which starts from the Basai Water Treatment Plant and supplies water up to Dundahera. The line was narrowed down for the pilot project. Thirty-nine locations and underground tanks were identified on this channel where the Gurgaon Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) supplies water from Basai. These locations include Palam Vihar blocks, Sector 21, Sector 22, Suncity, Sector 18, Carterpuri village, and the Electronic City among other places where water supply issue is reported every year. GMDA CEO Sudhir Rajpal explained the need for the CIWMS technology. “The core purpose of adopting this system was to ensure that water reaches equally to every household and no underground tank which falls under GMDA purview should be devoid of adequate water supply,"" he said. “It has been found that residents are now getting equal supply of water in a legal metred way. We have cut down non-revenue water from 70 per cent to almost 19 per cent and are working to further bring it down,"" he said. The advanced CIWMS involves installing of flow metres to gauge water flow, control valve to set data on the quantum of water to be supplied in any area, pressure transmitters to gauge water pressure, and level transmitter to measure the level of water in the underground tanks. The system also ensures that all data thus recorded is transmitted daily to an integrated command and control centre established in the GMDA. (With inputs from agencies)"

Nifty 50 index lost 391 points and closed at 16,667 mark whereas BSE Sensex crashed 1306 points and closed at 55,669 levels. Bank Nifty tumbled 899 points and closed at 35,264 levels. According to stock market experts, the present chart pattern also indicate a downside breakout of the broader high low range movement of around 17400-16900 levels. This could be considered as a downside breakout of crucial lower support in the market. This is not a good sign and could have more weakness for the short term. Bull vs bear: Day trading guide for stock market today Speaking on intraday trading strategy on Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities said, ""Having broken below the important support of 16800, the chances of further steep weakness in the near term are high. This anticipated market action could open a possibility of larger degree of lower bottom formation below 15670 levels in the next few weeks.

Our markets needed a breakout beyond the range for a directional move and finally on Wednesday, we witnessed a breakdown from the support end.

In derivative segment too, we saw formation of fresh short positions in Nifty as well as Bank Nifty. India VIX too surged and is hinting at higher volatility in the short term. So looking at the charts and the data, we expect the Nifty to continue its downtrend in the near term and head lower towards 16400 first. The above mentioned bearish pattern indicates a probable target around 16125, which we would expect from a positional perspective. On the flipside, the supports of 16825 and 17000 which were breached today will act as a resistance on any pullbacks.""

After losing for few sessions, the banking major has been able to remain strong throughout this month. According to Emkay Global research report, SBI's growth and margins are expected to improve and such strong fundamentals of leading Indian commercial bank may fuel its stock price up to ₹680 apiece levels in next 12 months. They have advised long term positional investors to buy SBI share for this one year target and book around 40 per cent profit in one year time. Expecting better core profitability; Emkay Global said, ""SBI has promised above-systemic credit growth of around 9.5 to 10 per cent in FY22E. It also expects +100bps above nominal GDP growth in FY23E. We have slightly trimmed our FY23 credit growth estimate for SBI by 100bps to near 12.7 per cent from 13.7 per cent, factoring in some moderation in GDP growth amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but expect the growth to improve to the tune of 15/16 per cent by FY24E/25E. SBI should benefit on the margin front in a rising rate cycle, given its continued cost advantage, higher retail orientation (including better-yielding Xpress Credit), and most importantly, better LDR. We expect FY22-24E core-profit CAGR of 20 per cent, in line with private peers."" Hailing SBI's focus on digital business, the research report said, ""SBI believes that 'Digital' is going to be the soul of future retail/corporate banking, and is stepping up its digital offerings via YONO 2.0 App and fintech tie-ups.

The new norms, which have been released as the framework for geo-tagging of payment system touch points, intends to assess the distribution of digital payment facilities across the country. RBI believes that capturing the accurate location of existing payment infrastructure is necessary to form future strategy and intervene when required. It had announced plans on geo-tagging in its Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies released on 8 October last year. Geo-tagging in this case refers to capturing the geographical coordinates of touch points used by merchants to receive payments from customers. This has various benefits such as providing insights on regional penetration of digital payments, monitoring infrastructure density across different locations, and identifying the scope for additional payment touch points, RBI said. Payment systems covered under this include point of sale (PoS) terminals and QR codes infrastructure. Operators would have to submit contact details of their individual nodal officers for this activity to RBI by 31 March, and the regulator would then allow them access to its Centralized Information Management System (CIMS) to submit the required information. Payment operators would now have to collect two kinds of data, including information related to merchants and data on the infrastructure deployed. Merchant details would include name, contact details, and merchant location details, while infrastructure details would mean general payment touch point details and touch point location details."

The case will set a precedent for the future of stressed assets in India and determine a pecking order for the rights of various institutions. The Amrapali housing project, abandoned by original promoters, was entrusted to a consortium of seven banks for restructuring the loans, reviving the project and handing over finished apartments to prospective home-buyers, whose advance payments were diverted by the original promoters. In August, the Supreme Court asked seven banks – Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, UCO Bank, State Bank of India, Indian Bank and Bank of India – to fund the project; the banks, in return, asked for regulatory forbearance on three counts: the project would be granted a priority sector status (which requires lower capital charge), loans to Amrapali project would continue to enjoy “standard"" status even in the event of a default, and, there would be no external valuation of the project to assess viability. The country’s central bank and banking regulator, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has objected to these conditions. RBI’s argument before the apex court is that the banks will be imperilling their depositors’ funds and therefore need to abide by the extant regulatory framework.        "
