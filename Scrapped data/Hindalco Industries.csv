Updated: 26 Jun 2022,"Bear days are numbered, build quality portfolio. These stocks are hot picks",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/bear-days-are-numbered-build-quality-portfolio-in-markets-these-stocks-are-hot-picks-11656263787991.html,"Markets recovered last week as equity benchmarks snapped a two-week losing streak as investors took a breather from inflation concerns due to the downside in commodity prices. Going forward, markets will continue to witness volatility as bearish stick still lingers with current macroeconomic risks, however, the days are numbered. The selling pressure is expected to be short-lived and experts have advised investors to build quality stocks portfolio. On Friday, Sensex finished at 52,727.98 up by 462.26 points or 0.88%. Nifty 50 closed at 15,699.25 higher by 142.60 points or 0.92%. Both the benchmarks have gained nearly 3% each from June 20 to 24. During these days, investors' wealth on BSE climbed by ₹7,40,977.89 crore. BSE market cap stood at ₹234,86,923.67 crore on June 20 and jumped to ₹242,27,901.56 crore on June 24. Research Analysts - Dharmesh Shah, Nitin Kunte, CMT, Pabitro Mukherjee, and Vinayak Parmar at ICICI Securities in their technical note said, equity benchmarks behaved contrary to our expectations as downbeat global cues tracking anxiety around rising inflation globally, rate hikes weighed on investor sentiments. On Nifty 50, they said the velocity of the decline accelerated on breach of March low of 15700 and drifted further to the 15200 mark. Going forward, the analysts said, ""We expect the index to gradually resolve higher and extend pullback towards the 16600 regions in coming months wherein strong support is placed in the vicinity of 14800-14600 zone, which we expect to hold as it is 80% retracement of CY-21 rally (13596-18604), at 14600. Thus, dips should be utilised to construct a portfolio by accumulating quality stocks in a staggered manner."" ICICI Securities analysts' positive bias is based on four factors: 1. The reading of the percentage of stocks above 200 DMA below 15 signifies extreme pessimism in the markets that eventually leads to a technical pullback to the tune of a minimum of 10% in the subsequent three months. 2. Index has already corrected 18% from the life highs and has approached oversold reading on the weekly momentum oscillator. The weekly RSI has approached its lowest level (placed at 35) since May 2020. Historically, a reading of 35 on weekly RSI has produced a decent pullback, and the analysts expect this rhythm to maintain in the coming months. 3. India continues to relatively outperform the EM basket even in the ongoing corrective phase despite significant selling by FIIs. Over the past one year, while the MSCI EM index has corrected over 40% from highs, India has relatively outperformed as the benchmark corrected only 18%. 4. The India VIX and crude oil prices have cooled off from the recent swing high. Indian Equities have an inverse correlation with the India VIX. Thus, providing impetus for the acceleration of ongoing pullback. They added, ""On the broader market front, in three instances over the past decade, intermediate correction in the Nifty Midcap, Small cap indices have been to the tune of 28% and 40%, respectively. At present, both indices have corrected 25% and 34%, respectively."" Therefore, the analysts said, ""any further correction is likely to be short-lived amid oversold territory and would set the stage for a technical pullback in coming weeks."" Here are the top picks of ICICI Securities analysts: BFSI - SBI, HDFC, Kotak Bank, Federal Bank, and Bajaj Finance. Telecom & Technology - Reliance, TCS, Infosys, L&T Infotech, HCL Technology, and Coforge. Capital goods - L&T, ABB, Siemens, BEL, AIA Engineering, ELGI Equipment, Sanghvi Movers, and Timken India. Consumption - Hindustan Unilever, Titan, ITC, Asian Paints, Tata Consumer, Havells India, Jubilant Foods, and Astral Poly. Auto - M&M, Maruti Suzuki, Ashok Leyland, Jamna Auto, Mahindra CIE, FIEM Industries, and Minda Industries. Infra and Realty - DLF LTD, Brigade Enterprise, and Phoenix Mills. Pharma & Chemicals - Divi's Laboratories, Cipla, Syngene, Torrent Pharma, and SRF Ltd. Metal - JSW Steel, Hindalco, and Graphite. Others - Adani Port, Indian Hotels, Zee Entertainment, Trent, Concor, Nocil, Balrampur Chinni, BDL, Bluedart, Dixon Technologies, Kansai Nerolac, and NRB Bearing. Markets weekly outlook: For the week June 27 to July 1, ICICI Direct analysts expect Nifty to eventually resolve past falling channel placed at 15800 and gradually head towards 16200 levels in coming weeks. In expiry week, use dips towards 15400 to create long positions as the index is poised at extreme oversold readings. ICICI Direct analysts added that brent oil prices have breached the weekly rising trend line indicating a loss of momentum and ""we expect upsides to be capped in 125-130 zone."" According to ICICI Direct analysts, amongst sectors preferences, IT, and BFSI are key sectors with favourable risk/reward, while Auto and Capital goods are expected to extend outperformance. The analysts prefer - SBI, HDFC, Kotak Bank, TCS, Maruti Suzuki, ITC, and Titan in large caps while in midcaps we like KPIT Technologies, Federal Bank, AIA Engineering, NRB Bearings, Ashok Leyland, Automotive Axles, Bharat Electronics, Havells, Trent, and Indian Hotel. Yesha Shah, Head of Equity Research, Samco Securities said, ""The coming week has a host of events arriving which could affect the mood of the market. Globally, investors will keenly analyze the US quarterly GDP growth rate numbers. The USA would officially enter into a recession if they post a negative growth and thus this could have a spill-over effect on global markets."" ""In India, the vehicle sales figures will continue to fuel stock-specific moves on D-Street as investors attempt to decipher the future trend,"" Shah added, ""Moreover, the monthly F&O expiry in the second half of the week may cause volatility in the indices. Investors are thus advised to accumulate good stocks with strong fundamentals, free cash flows, and lower leverage over the long run while disregarding short-term difficulties."""

Updated: 12 May 2022,Novelis to invest $2.5 bn in US plant,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/novelis-to-invest-2-5-bn-in-us-plant-11652295704751.html,"MUMBAI : The American unit of Hindalco Industries Ltd, the world’s largest aluminium rolling company, will invest $2.5 billion to build a new recycling and rolling plant in the US in the largest greenfield expansion plan by the parent Aditya Birla Group. The Novelis Inc. facility in Alabama will have an initial annual capacity to produce 600 kilotonnes of finished aluminium goods and will be completed by FY26, the company said on Wednesday. The latest announcement takes capex plans committed by Novelis to $3.4 billion, with four other new capex initiatives underway, two in the US and one each in South Korea and China. The company has committed to investing $365 million to build a recycling plant in Kentucky, US, and a $375 million cold mill in Zhenjiang, China. “This investment marks the start of another transformational growth phase for Novelis,"" Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of the Aditya Birla Group, said in a statement. “We continue to invest in each of the markets Novelis serves—from the beverage can to automotive, aerospace and specialities—and in all geographies. This is also the largest global greenfield expansion project of the Aditya Birla Group and will take the group’s total investment in the US across businesses to over $14 billion,"" Birla added. More than half of the capacity of the new facility will be used to serve the growing demand for aluminium beverage can sheets in North America, which is driven by consumer preference for more sustainable packaging, the statement said. The company added that the decision to build the recycling and rolling plant is backed by strong North American demand for flat-rolled, low-carbon aluminium from can makers and beverage companies. Aluminium beverage cans, bottles and cups are the models of sustainable packaging and the circular economy, it said, adding that with an average “can-to-can"" life cycle of just a couple of months, a can that is recycled today can be back in store shelves in as little as 60 days. “In addition, we are well-positioned to efficiently expand capacity at this facility in the future—above the 600kt announced today—to capture ongoing strong demand. Our readiness to invest in serving growing markets is a perfect example of how we are delivering on our company purpose of shaping a sustainable world together,"" said Steve Fisher, president and chief executive officer of Novelis. The facility will be the first fully integrated aluminium mill built in the US in 40 years, the company said. It is expected to create up to 1,000 high-paying jobs in modern manufacturing. The facility will be powered primarily by renewable energy, use recycled water and be a zero-waste facility, the company said. “It will also rely on railroad transportation, which can reduce logistics-related carbon emissions by up to 70% compared to road transport. The plant will make significant use of advanced automation and digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, augmented reality and robotics,"" it added. The addition of the new recycling centre for beverage cans will allow Novelis to recycle 90 billion cans globally, up from the 74 billion used beverage cans the company currently recycles. On Wednesday, Novelis also announced its financial results for the year ended 31 March. The company reported a fourfold jump in profit to $954 million. “We achieved record full-year results and crossed notable financial milestones for Adjusted Ebitda and net income, reflecting a continued focus on meeting strong customer demand for infinitely recyclable aluminium products while striving to advance our business and industry toward a more circular economy,"" Fisher said."

The facility, which will be built in in Alabama, will have a capacity of 600 kilotons of finished goods a year initially, the unit of Hindalco Industries Ltd. said in a statement. Work at the site is under way and the company expects to begin operations by the middle of 2025, it said. More than half the capacity will be used to meet the rising demand for aluminum beverage can sheets in North America, as consumers seek more sustainable packaging, the company said. The new facility will increase Novelis’s recycling capacity to 90 billion cans globally, from 74 billion currently, it said.  This will be billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Aditya Birla Group’s largest global greenfield expansion project and will take the group’s total investment in the US across businesses to over $14 billion, it said.

Hindalco said in March that it will spend as much as $7.2 billion to expand its aluminum business over the next five years, mainly across India and North America. The new facility will aim to be net carbon neutral for the emissions generated by itself and for its energy consumption, according to the statement.

Updated: 05 Apr 2022,Nifty's FY22 returns second-best returns in last seven years,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/niftys-fy22-returns-second-best-returns-in-last-seven-years-11649135017934.html,"The Indian equity market gave solid returns in financial year 2022, despite geopolitical turmoil playing spoilsport in the last quarter of FY22. An analysis by domestic brokerage house Motilal Oswal Financial Services showed that in FY22, Nifty50 recorded an impressive 19% year-on-year gain and ended the financial year with the second-best returns in seven years. Following the escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) ditched Indian equities as crude oil-led macro and micro impact made Indian stocks less attractive. Nonetheless, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) came to the rescue. DII flows into equities in FY22 were the highest ever at $26.8 billion compared to outflows of $18.4b in FY21, while FIIs witnessed equity outflows of $17.1 billion after five consecutive years of inflows, as per the Motilal Oswal report. Sectoral indices also posted decent performance during this period. ""Top gainers in the sectoral space were Utilities (+63%), Metals (+62%), Media (+54%), Oil & Gas (+42%), Telecom (+42%), and Technology (+40%). While Private Banks, Consumer, Autos, and Healthcare underperformed,"" added the report. Also, market breadth was positive in FY22, with 37 Nifty constituents closing higher. Stock-wise, Bajaj Finserv Ltd, Hindalco Industries Ltd, Titan Industries Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd, and ONGC were the top performers. On the other hand, HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd, Hero Motocorp Ltd, Shree Cement Ltd, BPCL and Hindustan Unilever Ltd were the top laggards. Broader markets also put up an impressive performance. The Nifty Midcap 100, up more than 25% y-o-y, and the Nifty Smallcap 100, up more than 29% y-o-y, outperformed the benchmark in FY22, showed the analysis. Meanwhile, going into FY23, corporate earnings would be key among the many factors that will decide the market mood. The March quarter numbers for FY22, will throw light on the impact of the Russia-Ukraine crisis on the margins of companies relying on crude-based raw materials.  IT giant Tata Consultancy Services Ltd will kick-off the Q4FY22 earnings season, with results scheduled for 11 April."
Updated: 19 Mar 2022,Hindalco maintains sheen as aluminium prices remain high,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/hindalco-maintains-sheen-as-aluminium-prices-remain-high-11647584035773.html,"Hindalco Industries Ltd’s shares have declined by 2% on NSE over the last week as the prices of aluminium on the London Metal Exchange (LME) softened from the peak observed on 4 March and fell by 3% in the past week. Even so, aluminium prices on the LME have increased by 19% in CY22 so far (till 17 March). There are primarily two factors which are causing the increase in aluminium prices. One, the Ukraine conflict has resulted in a surge in energy prices which has a bearing on the production of aluminium as it is an energy intensive metal. Second, the sanctions on Russia are a point of worry as it is the second largest exporter, said analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd in a report on 15 March. Also, the supply chains were disrupted with Russia invading Ukraine. On account of these factors and multi-year low LME inventory at 0.75 million tons, analysts at JM Financial believe that the current elevated levels are likely to prevail. Meanwhile, the demand environment is robust with this metal being widely used across most sectors such as automotive, beverage cans and aerospace industries. But rising oil prices means increasing costs. In this scenario, the Indian producers are comparatively better placed in terms of energy requirements as a significant portion of coal is being sourced through Coal India Ltd (CIL) linkages or captive mines. Hindalco obtained 60% of its coal requirements from CIL linkages in the December quarter (Q3FY22). “The outlook for Hindalco remains buoyant given a) Novelis Inc. (Hindalco’s overseas subsidiary) – strong LME-scrap spreads continue b) India aluminium continues to benefit from high realizations c) enhanced coal security post addition of Meenakshi and Chakla coal mines and d) strong free cash flow generation and focus on de-leveraging (short-term working capital requirements to increase) to contain net debt/EBITDA,"" added the JM Financial report. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Unsurprisingly, the shares of Hindalco have rallied by 21% so far in CY22. Overall, robust outlook on aluminium may well support the stock’s valuations at the current level, near-term upsides may be capped after the significant appreciation."

This acquisition from Hydro, the Norway-headquartered aluminium and energy company, brings into the Hindalco fold, an integrated facility located in Kuppam, Andhra Pradesh, the world’s largest aluminium rolling and recycling company said in a statement to the stock exchanges today. Hydro’s Kuppam plant has a 15,000-tonne aluminium extrusions capacity. It is integrated with advanced value addition capabilities for surface finishing and fabrication. Located about 120 kilometres from Bengaluru, the Kuppam facility offers custom aluminium extrusion products and solutions for auto, building and construction, and industrial applications. As per Hindalco, it will help extend Hindalco’s footprint in South India, the second largest extrusions market in India. Satish Pai, Managing Director, Hindalco said the acquisition of the Kuppam plant is a strategic step to expand the company's presence in the upper-end of the value-added market. ""The plant’s specialised product portfolio will enhance our capabilities in high-end extrusions and fabricated solutions,"" he said. As per Pai, the acquisition is the latest step in Hindalco's long-term strategy to augment its downstream business. ""Over the past year, we have already announced a total capex of ₹3,730 crore towards addition of downstream capacities at Silvassa and Hirakud. Our recent acquisition of the Ryker copper wire rod unit for our copper value-added portfolio is also in line with this strategy,"" he added. Hindalco is eying to increase downstream capacity to meet the growing market demand, and expand product portfolio and increase revenue from value-added products.

The aluminium extrusions market in India is expected to grow rapidly from the current level of around 373,000 tonnes to reach about 850,000 tonnes by 2030. Once commissioned, the Kuppam and Silvassa units are expected to boost Hindalco’s total aluminium extrusions capacity from 60,000 tonnes to 109,000 tonnes. The transaction is expected to close in the next quarter. The Hindalco share is trading at ₹455.30, up ₹4.80 or 1.07 per cent, on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) today.

Overall, it believes that the economy is on the right path and will chug along till March. A third wave looks less likely, and the vaccination drive is progressing well and hence it is reasonable to expect that the impact if at all it comes will be better borne by business.  ""We believe the pent-up demand would get diluted in manufacturing while it will elongate for services progressively. Job creation is the clue in the medium term if consumption is to be kept ticking. We must remember that inflation is a dampener and while statistically it is less than 5%, high fuel cost, prices of services and manufactured goods will hit consumption once the pent-up fury recedes,"" it said. Despite covid led lockdowns and uncertainties which had deterred economic growth, Samvat 2077 ended with best gains in 13 years. Riding on abundant liquidity, investors made nearly 40% profit in equities this year - best returns compared to other asset classes. Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty gained 39-40% in Samvat 2077. Last year, when markets had bounced from a major crash in March, both Sensex and Nifty gained 10-11%. Equity markets had a historical journey in Samvat 2077, touching new life- time highs with the Nifty surpassing the 18000-mark while the Sensex crossing 60,000 for the first time. Analysts said the government’s fiscal stimulus and a soft monetary policy stance of global central bankers were key drivers of equities in Samvat 2077. Post the second wave of covid, signs of improvement in high-frequency key economic indicators such as GST collection, railway freight, power consumption, import-export data, e-way bills among others amid vaccination boosted investor sentiment. Overall, most sectors delivered positive returns, with metals ( up 128%), realty (up 113%) and PSU banks (up 93%) as top gainers. Sectors such as pharma (up 23%), FMCG (up 29%) and private banks (up 30%) were underperformers as defensives took a breather. In comparison, mid- and small-caps did exceedingly well in Samvat 2077. The BSE MidCap index surged 61% while the BSE SmallCap jumped 79% during the year.  "
Updated: 30 Aug 2021,"With aluminium prices near 1-year high, India’s smelters reap benefits",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/with-aluminium-prices-near-1-year-high-india-s-smelters-reap-benefits-11630256051498.html,"India’s aluminium manufacturers are getting a shot in the arm with a steady increase in the metal’s prices because of supply-side bottlenecks in the world’s largest primary aluminium producer, China. Aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) scaled a one-year high of about $2,650 a tonne last week, bringing the year-to-date increase to almost 35%. Demand has not cooled and the growing disruptions in supply from China are driving prices up. The disruptions are largely because of new emission rules, power shortages and floods in July. Aluminium prices are expected to stay elevated in the near term, according to analysts. “With stronger-than-estimated demand, we now see the aluminium market in deficit from CY2021. A multi-year deficit market and tepid supply response should keep prices higher for longer,"" said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a note. Domestic aluminium prices are driven by the landed cost of imports. For Indian aluminium makers such as Hindalco Industries Ltd and Vedanta Ltd, such elevated prices mean better realizations. No wonder, their shares have climbed in the past week. Hindalco gained 8.5% last week, while Vedanta climbed 4.8%. Given the outlook on aluminium prices, the earnings outlook for the two firms has improved. As such, a strong June-quarter performance has buttressed their valuations. Hindalco’s domestic aluminium business reported a 29% sequential increase in Ebitda for the June quarter. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. This was despite volume declining 8% sequentially due to the impact of the lockdown. The firm attributed this primarily to favourable macros, improved product mix and better operational efficiencies. “The profitability of the Indian aluminium business has been rising, driven both by higher realizations and, more importantly, lower costs as domestic coal availability has improved,"" said analysts at Credit Suisse Research in a 23 August note. Credit Suisse analysts have raised their FY22 LME aluminium price forecast to $2,670/tonne (from $1,900/tonne). Among base metals, the brokerage is most positive on aluminium, given its structural use in a decarbonizing world for expanded grids, lighter vehicles and solar photovoltaic projects. The supply of the metal is likely to be tepid, they said. Vedanta, too, stands to benefit from rising aluminium prices. That said, the company has diversified interests in other metals, power, and oil and gas. Given the outlook on international aluminium prices, it is no surprise that companies want to add capacity. Hindalco’s US subsidiary Novelis plans to expand capacity in the downstream business. Synergies from the Aleris acquisition also bode well. The benefits may exceed expectations with the integration in China alone expected to be $100 million, according to analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. A 24 August report by Crisil Ltd forecasts capex worth ₹25,000 crore over the next two fiscal years, which may augment smelter capacity by 10%. “Domestic producers are looking to increase the share of downstream capacities to more than 35% from 20% over the medium term. This will burnish realizations and strengthen business profiles,"" the report said. Meanwhile, there are risks. Global metal prices could come under pressure if the outlook on demand gets hit. One way of that happening would be the US Federal Reserve beginning to withdraw its accommodation. For now, though, Indian smelters can reap the rewards."

All eyes are on the Reserve Bank of India monetary policy review outcome which is scheduled on Friday. The decision of status quo on key rates is already priced in however RBI’s stance on inflation and commentary on growth will be key focus among investors. On Thursday, markets were at record high. The BSE Sensex rose 123.07 points or 0.23% at 54,492.84 while the Nifty was up 35.80 points or 0.22% at 16,294.60. Most Asian stocks dipped Friday as traders weighed the spread of the delta coronavirus strain against a record Wall Street close while awaiting key U.S. payrolls data. A gauge of the dollar climbed. Shares fell in Hong Kong and China, where Beijing’s regulatory crackdown and a warning about a possible downward spiral at China Evergrande Group—the world’s most indebted developer—subdued sentiment. Japan fluctuated, with Nintendo Co. weighing after a profit miss. US contracts were little changed in the wake of fresh peaks for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 on solid earnings. An overnight release showing a second weekly drop in US jobless claims stoked some expectations for a strong payrolls report Friday that could spark market swings. Treasuries retreated. Crude oil headed for its biggest weekly loss this year on demand risks from Covid-19. Trader focus is firmly on the US payrolls report. Weak data could exacerbate concerns that the bounce back from the pandemic is losing steam. A robust number stands to benefit reflation trades linked to economic reopening -- providing markets aren’t spooked by the argument that such data strengthen the case for the Federal Reserve to taper massive stimulus support.

Updated: 20 Jun 2021,DGTR recommends anti-dumping duty on aluminium foil imports,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/dgtr-recommends-anti-dumping-duty-on-aluminium-foil-imports-11624207964323.html,"The Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) has recommended imposing anti-dumping duty on imports of aluminium foils from China, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia to offset the injury to domestic industry from cheaper imports. After a year-long investigation into the complaints filed by Hindalco Industries Ltd, Raviraj Foils Ltd and Jindal India Ltd about the dumping of aluminium foil of 80 microns and below in FY20, DGTR recommended the finance ministry to impose anti-dumping duty between $93.53-$976.99 per tonne on foil. DGTR dismissed the suggestion that Raviraj and Jindal India are importing foil stock and therefore cannot claim the status of domestic industry. However, it did not include foil stock as a separate anti-dumping investigation concerning dumped imports of foil stock is being undertaken. The opposing parties, including domestic users, claimed aluminium foil is an eco-friendly alternative to plastic bags, and the imposition of anti-dumping duty would worsen the demand-supply gap for the subject goods. “No ADD (anti-dumping duty) should be recommended on the PUC (product under consideration) as domestic suppliers would increase the foil price disproportionately, impacting the users heavily. The last ADD imposed on China PR for foils between 5.5 microns to 80 microns resulted in domestic suppliers increasing price from ₹35 to ₹40 per kg,"" they added. However, the domestic producers held that imposition of duty will not impact the demand-supply gap. “Domestic industry has recently expanded capacity, and other producers will undertake expansions. The domestic capacity is sufficient to meet the demand of the country; thus, there is no question of demand-supply gap,"" they submitted. DGTR concurred with the domestic producers, holding that the purpose of the anti-dumping law is to create a level-playing field for production and consumption of the goods in the Indian market. “The imposition of ADD does not create a situation of monopoly as the imports from other suppliers, including those from the subject countries, are not prevented from competing in the Indian market,"" it added. India is currently the largest user of anti-dumping measures among World Trade Organization (WTO) members."
Updated: 16 Jun 2021,Why copper stocks are falling today — explained,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/why-copper-stocks-are-falling-today-explained-11623832015685.html,"Stock market news: Copper stocks extended the selloff triggered on Tuesday as stocks like Hindalco Industries, Hindustan Copper and Vedanta have received heavy beating since opening bell. At NSE (1:06 PM), Hindalco Industries share price was down 2.7 per cent, Hindustan Copper share price was down 3.32 per cent while Vedanta share price was 2.25 per cent lower from its yesterday close. According to experts, this selloff in the copper stocks is because of the copper price falling to its two month low. However, they maintained that it would work as sentimental trigger as this fall in the copper price is due to the Chinese announcement to use its copper reserves to go hard on the copper price. Speaking on the reason for bearish trend in copper stocks Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities said, ""Copper prices have fallen to its two month low. This copper price crash is triggered by the Chinese announcement to use its copper reserves instead of importing copper from the global merchandize. This has triggered selloff in the copper stocks but we can soon witness trend reversal as Chinese fear is more sentimental than fundamental in nature."" Expecting pressure in the metal sector for immediate short-term Ravi Singhal, Vice Chairman at GCL Securities said, ""Chinese government has announced that it will use its copper, aluminium and zinc reserves for its domestic usages via public bidding. That means they are in mood to discourage import of these metals and hence in next one week to a fortnight, we can witness selloff pressure in the metal segment. But, it would be more an opportunity than to get panic."" Singhal said that Vedanta, Hindalco Industries and Hindustan Copper are quality stock with strong fundamentals. He advised investors to buy at the lower levels. On what could be the buying strategy in Hindalco Industries shares Ravi Singhal said, ""One can buy Hindalco Industries stocks at around ₹350 to ₹360 maintaining the stop loss at ₹330. In next three to four months, it may go up to ₹444 levels."" Sharing major levels in Vedanta share price Ravi Singhal said, ""One can buy Vedanta shares in ₹240 to ₹250 range for the target of ₹330 in next three to four month. However, one must maintain stop loss at ₹209."" Unveiling investment strategy in Hindustan Copper stocks Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking said, ""One can buy Hindustan Copper stocks at ₹150 to ₹155 for the target of ₹170 to ₹180 in next 15 days of the position. But, the investor is advised to maintain stop loss at ₹135."" As per the Reuters report, copper prices fell to their lowest in nearly two months on Wednesday, weighed down by supply pressure after top consumer China announced a plan to sell its national reserves of the metal to stabilise prices. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange dropped by as much as 0.8 per cent to $9,489 a tonne, its lowest since April 23."

Benchmarks Sensex and Nifty slipped 1% each for the week while Nifty Midcap and Nifty Bank declined 1% and 2% lower respectively. Banks and financials, IT, metals, auto stocks were the top draggers during the week. Nifty Metal plunged more than 3% on Friday. Key factors to guide market in the week ahead: Earnings: Major companies like State Bank of India, Bharti Airtel, Tata Motors, Indian Oil Corp, Havells, Hindalco and Federal Bank are some of the prominent names who will be announcing their March quarter earnings during the week. Along with them, Shree Cement, Bosch, Colgate Palmolive, JSW Steel, Canara Bank, GSK Pharma, Ujjivan Small Finance Bank are also going to be declaring their financial results. Covid updates: India has been recording a decline in covid-19 cases across the country. The daily recoveries outnumbered new cases on Sunday for the fifth time in last 6 days, as per the Union Health Ministry data. The fall in the number of cases could act as a support for the market. Pace of the vaccination drive, decline in cases will be closely watched along with states’ restrictive measures. Macro: The Wholesale price index (WPI) inflation data for April is scheduled to be released on Monday. In March, inflation rate based on the wholesale price index (WPI) jumped to 8-year high to 7.39%. As per government data released last week, India’s index of industrial production shot up 22.4% in March, while retail inflation eased to a three-month low of 4.29% in April. FII flows: Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have continued to be the net sellers as they pulled out ₹6,452 crore so far in May amid tumbling investor sentiment due to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. As per depositories data, the overseas investors pulled out ₹6,427 crore from equities and ₹25 crore from the debt segment during May 1-14. However, it will be crucial to watch the upcoming trend if the covid cases continue to decline. Technical view: Sameet Chavan of Angel Broking said, ''It would be wise to mention few key levels and keep a close track of it in the first half of the forthcoming week. As far as supports are concerned, 14540 followed by 14400 are to be seen as key levels.'' A sustainable move below the lower range would certainly dent the possibility of some positivity in the short term. On the flipside, 14750 – 14830 are to be seen as key hurdles. If we have to regain strength then Nifty needs to go beyond 14830 first, he said. ''We advise traders to keep a tab of all the above mentioned levels and meanwhile continue with a stock centric approach. Further, it’s advisable to stay light and avoid aggressive bets till the time global volatility subsides,'' added Chavan. Traders would also be keeping an eye on global updates, US bond yields, rupee and crude oil prices levels."

His Aditya Birla Group has already unveiled plans to plow in about $2.4 billion across businesses in the past few weeks, months after putting on hold some of its expansion programs on account of the Covid-related lockdowns. Also Read | Battered infra dream awaits a new deal “Economists were throwing many letters at us -- V, W, X -- all sorts of things to describe the possible economic recovery. For us, its pretty much been a V,"" said Birla, the chairman of the group. “It’s been a very sharp recovery, a very huge surprise for all of us."" Birla’s expectations for a rebound echo those of India’s central bank, as some of the nation’s key indicators, including manufacturing, demand for loans and consumer purchases, showed signs of strengthening. The $2.9 trillion economy is set to shrink 7.7% in the year through March, its first full-year contraction in more than four decades, according to government estimates. The International Monetary Fund forecast an almost 12% gain in gross domestic product for Asia’s third-largest economy in 2021, albeit on a low base owing to the pandemic. Barring a second wave, the “worst is behind us"" with India kicking off a vaccination drive against Covid-19, the Reserve Bank of India said in its January bulletin. Grasim Industries Ltd., Birla’s flagship firm, said last week that it was entering the paints business and plans to invest Rs50 billion ($685 million) over three years. UltraTech Cement Ltd. said in December that it will spend Rs54.77 billion to increase capacity by 12.8 million tons annually while the group’s metals unit, Hindalco Industries Ltd. will spend Rs70 billion to double its aluminum downstream capacity over the next few years. Just in June last year, Hindalco said it was slowing down its expansion plans, while Novelis Inc., Hindalco’s U.S.-based aluminum unit, also delayed the ramp up of new finishing facilities in Guthrie, U.S. and Changzhou, China, until the second half of the fiscal year to align with demand. ‘Fizz Is Back’ The group, with roots dating back to 1857, has seen strong growth in its financial services, fashion retail, cement and metals businesses, according to Birla. “We are looking to grow very large in these companies,"" he said, adding that he was open to growing them organically or through acquisitions. “For Aditya Birla Group, the fizz is back."" The traction in other businesses is helping offset challenges in reviving Vodafone Idea Ltd. -- an indebted wireless carrier Birla jointly owns with U.K.’s Vodafone Group Plc. The local operator has reported nine straight quarters of losses amid intense price competition and faces $8 billion in government dues and has been losing subscribers to rivals. The Aditya Birla Group employs more than 120,000 employees across 36 countries and earns over 50% of its revenues from overseas, according to its website. “The recovery will be a little patchy,"" Birla said. China could race ahead to surpass European Union this year, while the U.S., Japan and some countries in Europe are unlikely to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels this year, he said."

Billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s aluminum major will invest ₹7,000 crore to double its capacity to more than 600,000 tons annually over the next few years, the company said in an exchange statement on Monday. The company will kick off its long-term downstream investment plan by setting up a 34,000-ton aluminum extrusion project in the western Indian town of Silvassa, with production expected to start in two years. “We are seeing a revival in the economy, with demand picking in the building and construction and automotive sectors,"" Managing Director Satish Pai said in the statement. “This has given us the confidence to move forward."" That’s a reversal from June, when the company said it would be slowing down its expansion plans due to the impact of Covid-related lockdowns on the economy. India’s economy contracted a record 24% in the quarter ended June, after a nationwide lockdown brought businesses and mobility to a standstill. It improved in the July-September period, declining 7.5% from a year ago, with the gradual scaling back of restrictions and a pick up in manufacturing activity. Hindalco said it expects India’s demand for such products to jump to 850,000 tons by 2030 from 373,000 tons currently."

The proposed ₹730 crore unit is the first step towards reviving Hindalco’s downstream investment plan, which had been pushed back because of covid-19. Satish Pai, managing director, Hindalco Industries, said, “We are seeing a revival in the economy, with demand picking in the building and construction and automotive sectors. This has given us the confidence to move forward. The Silvassa facility will enable us to service our customers faster, with an offering of high-end quality aluminium products."" The Silvassa plant will be fully-automated and will include three extrusion presses and will enable Hindalco to service premium customers in the building and construction, auto and transport, electrical, consumer and industrial goods sectors. Aluminium has been gaining ground as the preferred sustainable metal across these sectors as it is infinitely recyclable and enables industries to integrate circular economy models in their operations, the company said. The aluminium extrusion market in India is expected to grow exponentially – from the current 3,73,000 tonnes to reach about 850,000 tonnes by 2030, a press release from Hindalco said. Western and southern regions of the domestic market account for over 60% of the extrusion market. The Silvassa facility will allow Hindalco to serve customers in these regions with superior quality, faster service and shorter response times. ""Over the next few years, as part of our downstream strategy, we intend to enhance our capacity from over 300,000 tonnes currently, to more than 600,000 tonnes with investments of around ₹7,000 crore,"" Pai said. “Our focus on downstream assets is part of our sustainable business model with an emphasis on further de-risking our business from LME (London Metal Exchange) volatility."" Hindalco’s existing extrusion plants in Renukoot in Uttar Pradesh and Alupuram in Kerala cater mainly to auto, defence, aerospace, and industrial segments. The Silvassa facility will add an additional 34,000-tonne capacity with focus on the B&C segment which comprises over 60% of the extrusion market, apart from auto, transport and other segments. Commercial production at the plant is expected to start in 24 months."

While revenue from operations rose 5% year-on-year, the bottomline took a hit because of a loss of ₹1,398 crore on the sale of an asset in the US. As a pre-condition to Novelis’ acquisition of US-based rolled aluminium producer Aleris Corp earlier this year, Novelis had to sell its Lewisport, Kentucky, automotive aluminum body sheet plant to private equity firm American Industrial Partners for estimated net cash proceeds of about $171 million. The sale value is about half of the asset’s book value of $358 million. “We had 10-15 buyers lined up pre-covid but many dropped post-covid and we were left with very few buyers,"" Satish Paid, managing director, Hindalco, said. “The only buyers left were private equity companies and frankly, it was a fire sale. We had already lost arbitration proceedings with the (US) Department of Justice in March and they pushed to close this by October because of the administration change."" “We were not treated very well. We are disappointed that we did not get a fair deal from the (US) Department of Justice,"" Pai said. Novelis, and Hindalco, in the consolidated results, recognised a loss of $187 million ( ₹1406 crore) pre-tax as a result of re-measurement of the asset’s fair value on sale, causing the nosedive in net profit this quarter. Another plant in Duffel, Belgium, was sold to Alvance, part of the GFG Alliance, according to conditions set by the European Commission. The company recorded a profit of ₹135 crore on this sale. Pai said the GFG Alliance had initially agreed in January to buy the asset at 310 million euros but post-covid, tried to negotiate the deal. “We have got 210 million euros and for the remaining 100 euros we will arbitrate; there, our position is quite strong. We signed an agreement and they will have to pay."" Hindalco reported revenue from operations of ₹31,237 crore in Q2FY21, up 5% from ₹29,657 crore in the year-ago period, with its US subsidiary Novelis reporting a 29% surge in operating income from ₹2629 crore last year to ₹3392 crore this year. The earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) from the domestic aluminium business rose 32% year-on-year to ₹1066 crore even as Ebitda from copper manufacturing fell by a similar 32% to 208 crore this quarter. The company took a hit of ₹1398 crore as loss from discontinued operations this quarter. Novelis and the domestic aluminium business were supported by higher volumes and better product mix, lower input costs, stability in operations, and cost saving initiatives, a record performance in production of beverage cans and a market revival in the automotive and high-end specialty markets in the US and Asia. “It is heartening to see a sharp recovery of demand to near pre-covid levels in India aluminium and copper businesses,"" Pai said. “Novelis too sees a similar rise across segments, except for aerospace. Operationally, we have maintained high efficiency and productivity, thus enabling us to deliver a sharp increase in profit after tax as compared to both last quarter and last year."" Shares of Hindalco fell 1.4% to close at ₹192 on the BSE today."

Adani Enterprises Ltd, Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd (BALCO), Jindal Power Ltd, JSW Steel Ltd, DB Power Ltd, Hindalco Industries Ltd, and Nuvoco Vistas Corporation Ltd were also in fray today for the Gare Palma IV/7 coal mine. The union coal ministry auctioned 19 coal mines in the first tranche of commercial coal mine auctions that began on 2 November. The mines are being awarded on a revenue-sharing basis, while earlier blocks were allocated to companies on the payment of fixed amounts per tonne. While addressing a press conference on the last date of India’ first commercial coal mine auctions that began on 2 November, union coal minister Pralhad Joshi said, “In our first-ever attempt at auction for commercial mining, a large number of mines were put up for auctions and bidding in a single tranche."" “It was the 11th tranche of auction under CMSP Act, 2015 and first tranche of auction under MMDR Act, 1957,"" he added.

But it is interesting to note that participants in the bidding process also include players from several other sectors like Real Estate, Infrastructure, Pharma, etc. It proves that opening up the coal sector has garnered interest from other sectors as well,"" Joshi said. India’s coal requirement is expected to go up to 1123 million tonnes (mt) by 2023 from the present levels of around 700 mt. The earlier plan was to mine 1.5 billion tonnes of coal by 2020.

The statement comes at a time when fossil fuel investments are losing sheen and global energy investment landscape is rapidly evolving, with a focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing. While addressing a press conference on the last date of the commercial coal mine auctions that began on 2 November, Joshi appealed to the governments of the coal bearing states to cooperate with the successful bidders to help expedite the fuel’s production. While transitioning to a green economy, India has also called for a reset on climate debate on coal as a fuel. India plans to have 175 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy capacity by 2022, which is further to be scaled up to 450 GW by 2030. “And this is the time that there is a huge opportunity for growth,"" Joshi said as the auction process for the Gare Palma IV/7 coal mine in Chhattisgarh was still on, which is set to attract the highest revenue share or premium over and above the floor price.

A total of 115 coal mines have been auctioned over the last 10 tranches. Indian coal sector has welcomed the move for commercial coal mining. “Government of India’s decision to open coal sector for commercial mining is a welcome and bold step.

An upfront payment of ₹1048 crore will be made to the state governments, and will be adjusted later. Joshi said that while the Jharkhand government had expressed apprehension over revenue in the present covid situation, he was happy to share that with ₹2,690 crore in direct annual revenues from its coal mines auctioned, the state will be the highest revenue earner amongst peers whose mines have been bid out in this tranche. The Jharkhand government has also filed a suit in the Supreme Court regarding these commercial coal mine auctions. Responding to a query about Supreme Court stating that any actions are provisional and will be subject to the orders of the apex court, Joshi said, “Whatever the Supreme Court has said is a direction to all of us and naturally it will be followed."""

The auction under which 19 coal blocks would go under the hammer will continue for eight days, from November 2-9, according to the latest calender for electronic auction of the coal ministry. On Monday, the electronic auction would be held for five coal blocks --Chakla, Jharkhand; Marki Mangli-II, Maharashtra; Radhikapur (West), Odisha; Takli-Jena-Bellora (North) & TakliJena-Bellora (South), Maharashtra; and Urtan, Madhya Pradesh. Companies like Hindalco Industries and Adani Enterprises will be vying for Chakla coal block in Jharkhand on Monday. In case of Radhikapur (West) coal block in Odisha, companies like Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) and Vedanta Ltd are in race. With regard to Marki Mangli-II block in Maharashtra, Yazdani International Pvt Ltd, Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation Ltd and Refex Industries Ltd will be competing against each other. Aurobindo Reality and Infrastructure Pvt Ltd and Sunflag Iron and Steel Company Ltd are in the race for Takli-Jena-Bellora (North) and TakliJena-Bellora (South) coal block in Maharashtra . JMS Mining Private Ltd and Stratatech Mineral Resources Pvt Ltd would be vying for Urtan block block in Madhya Pradesh. In June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the auction process for 41 coal blocks for commercial mining, a move that opens India's coal sector to private players, and termed it a major step in the direction of India achieving self-reliance. The auction of coal blocks for commercial mining is expected to garner ₹33,000 crore of capital investment over the next five to seven years. The launch of the auction process not only marks the beginning of unlocking of the country's coal sector from the lockdown of decades but aims at making India the largest exporter of coal, the prime minister had said. Despite being the world's fourth-largest producer, India is the second-largest importer of the dry-fuel. The coal ministry had later revised the list of mines to be auctioned."

At 0251 pm, Hindalco shares traded at ₹178.45, up 2.5% from its previous close, while the benchmark Sensex was up 0.9% to 39,047.06. Earlier, the European Commission and Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation had determined that Novelis's acquisition of Aleris, which closed earlier this year, could proceed on the condition that Novelis divest the Duffel plant to a third party that met certain buyer suitability requirements. ""Both regulators have now approved ALVANCE as a suitable buyer and have permitted the sale to be completed,"" the company said in a BSE filing made on Friday. In November last year, ALVANCE had agreed to acquire the Duffel facility for 310 million euros. At closing on 30 September, Novelis received 210 million euros in cash. The parties have agreed to a post-closing arbitration process regarding the payment of the remaining 100 million euros. The Aleris acquisition provides a strong pro-forma financial profile for Novelis with many strategic benefits and continues to be value accretive, with the long-term outlook in line with the original acquisition case. Novelis, the world's largest recycler of aluminium, serves customers in the aerospace, automotive, beverage can and specialties industries throughout North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. The company reported a standalone net loss of ₹40 crore for the June quarter compared to a net profit of ₹23 crore in the year-ago period. Revenue from operations stood at ₹7,420 crore in the last quarter, down 26% on year. Hindalco Industries, among the flagship company of the Aditya Birla Group, is the world's largest aluminium rolling and recycling company, and a major copper player. It is also one of Asia's largest producers of primary aluminium."

Updated: 10 Sep 2020,Q2 to pave way for Hindalco’s recovery: Birla,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/hindalco-to-recover-to-pre-covid-levels-by-h2fy21-birla-11599748128433.html,"Mumbai: Hindalco Industries Ltd expects its second quarter performance to pave the way for a recovery, considering that all its aluminium upstream plants are operating nearly at full capacity. Aluminium production is recovering rapidly to pre-covid levels, with all logistics infrastructure back on track, Aditya Birla group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla told shareholders at the annual general meeting. “All aluminium downstream plants are operating at partial capacity to meet market conditions. The export demand remains stable and continues to offset the subdued domestic market conditions,"" Birla said. “The copper facilities are also ramping up to their optimal levels. At Novelis, all plants are operational, and many are now running at full capacity. All the automotive customers in North America and China are now pulling at nearly pre-covid levels,"" he said. In FY20, Hindalco had delinked 80% of its consolidated earnings before interest and taxes from the London Metal Exchange (LME) prices. “Despite the slump in Q1 gross domestic product (of the Indian economy), the activity levels are gradually normalizing. I remain confident that India’s long-term growth potential remains intact despite the covid-19 setback,"" Birla said. “For Hindalco, I expect Q2 to be better than Q1. We should be back to pre-covid levels in H2FY21,"" he said. Birla said the company has earmarked $450-500 million as capital expenditure for Novelis for FY21, and ₹1,500 crore for Hindalco’s domestic operations. The company will cut fixed costs by 15% in FY21. “On a broader level, our strategy of improving business sustainability by reducing our exposure to LME price fluctuations and increasing the share of downstream value-added products across businesses is playing out well,"" Birla said. “Your company will continue to strengthen the balance sheet through growth strategies and generating positive free cash flows. What continues to hurt the domestic aluminium and copper industry is low-cost imports. In response, the company is maintaining a relentless focus on better efficiencies and cost competitiveness,"" he said. “All of our smelters continue to be in the first quartile of the global cost curve. Cash conservation and maintaining adequate liquidity will help us deliver sustained performance despite the current tough environment due to covid-19,"" Birla added. In FY20, Hindalco reported consolidated EBITDA of ₹15,536 crore on a turnover of ₹1,18,144 crore and achieved its highest-ever production and shipment of aluminium upstream and copper value-added products when both aluminium and copper sectors faced a volatile and challenging year globally, primarily due to rising trade barriers and uncertainty surrounding trade and geopolitics. The prolonged US-China trade war dampened global economic sentiments which in turn affected aluminium consumption through the 2019 calendar year. Despite this, Birla noted that Hindalco continued to achieve record aluminium production levels at 1.314 million tonnes and alumina production of 2.735 million tonnes in FY2019-20. The company also completed the acquisition of US-based Aleris last fiscal at an enterprise value of $2.8 billion, which will add aerospace and specialty aluminium capabilities to Novelis’ portfolio, while making the parent company the leading aluminium value-added player in the world."
Updated: 23 Aug 2020,"Markets are overpricing the recovery, but small-caps may be frothy",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/markets-are-overpricing-the-recovery-but-small-caps-may-be-frothy-11598178357103.html,"Stock markets are humming well to the tune of liquidity. The Nifty is inching forward. But action may well have tipped over to the mid- and small-cap stocks. Over the past month, the frontline index gained a mere 2%, but the Nifty Mid-cap 100 and Small-cap 100 gained 10% and 15% respectively. The big question is, are the markets overheating. For the moment, it seems so. Earnings are still showing stress. Nifty 50’s revenues declined 29% year-on-year. Sure, operating profits rode on sharp cost-cutting, but results from heavyweights Reliance Industries, TCS and ITC belied expectations. Barring healthcare, utilities, private banks, most sectors were severely hit including metals, telecom and auto. Investors are expecting a return to normal, but earnings growth too full normalcy is a long time away, say analysts. For smaller companies, the recovery could take even longer. But some of these stocks are soaring as if normalcy is just around the corner. The recent run-up suggests the market may just be beginning to over-price the recovery. “After the 50% rally from March 20 lows, we believe some of this recovery is priced in. At 20.5 times 1-year forward price-earnings, the Nifty is now trading at a premium and is not offering a lucrative risk-reward proposition. Further upside hereon, in our opinion, hinges on demand/earnings normalisation and the abatement of the pandemic,"" said a Motilal Oswal Financial Services note. Further, returns could be selective and limited to a few good counters. Some signs of selective buying are already visible. Stocks in themes that are aiding work-from-home, vaccine, self-reliance, technology have been trotting ahead. Nevertheless, some stocks are quite overvalued compared to their peers and their growth rates. A case in the point is Berger Paints. For companies like Hindalco, growth in the overseas market is lending a helping hand. India’s largest private sector bank, HDFC Bank, faces some lawsuits overseas, though the outcome may be negative. For some tyre makers such as Balkrishna Industries, the agri-sector and the replacement market are supporting earnings growth. But some stocks like HDFC AMC have been hit by the slowing growth in the sector. Shares of Tata Power jumped last week after the company unveiled a plan to improve return ratios. The Nifty 50 has two entrants SBI Life Insurance and Divi’s Laboratories. The latter is a contract manufacturing pharmaceutical as well as a supplier of active pharma ingredients, which are doing well. But the stock is quite pricey. Still, the resilience of the stock market given all the increase in covid-19 cases across India is remarkable. And while liquidity is quite good, it does not seem like the Reserve Bank of India may be able to lower rates any time soon. Inflation is again rearing its ugly head. However, caution should be the keyword. Some smaller stocks and names with inferior inflations are running up considerably showing that froth is building up in many counters. As such, many stocks across sectors are back to their pre-covid levels despite their muted earnings and high debt levels. Most of them don’t have any growth drivers. If the music stops, these stocks could fall harder."

Hindalco, India's top aluminium and copper producer, said it would supply 2.5 million tonnes of bauxite residue, also known as red mud, to 40 cement companies this year, to help cement makers to replace their existing raw materials such as laterite, a mineral. Of the 2.5 million tonnes, 1.2 million tonnes would go to UltraTech's 14 cement plants spread across seven states. ""We are trying to match the price of laterite,"" Satish Pai, managing director of Hindalco Industries Ltd, told Reuters. When aluminium producers process bauxite they get red mud, considered particularly dangerous for marine life, as a by-product. Since two dam disasters in Brazil and Papua New Guinea's Basamuk Bay, where red mud from a nickel plant spilled into the sea last year, disposal of red mud has come under greater scrutiny. Hindalco, which generates 4.5 million tonnes of red mud every year, also plans to use the by-product for road construction and in brick kilns and embankments, Pai said.

Updated: 16 Aug 2020,COVID-19 triggers once in-a-century crisis; economy may contract in FY21: Birla,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/covid-19-triggers-once-in-a-century-crisis-economy-may-contract-in-fy21-birla-11597574581365.html,"Hindalco Industries Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla has said COVID-19 and associated lockdowns have triggered a once in-a-century crisis for the society and the economy and the country's GDP may contract in 2020-21. He mentioned that COVID-19 struck India at a time when the underlying economic conditions were subdued on account of heightened global uncertainty and stress in the domestic financial system. ""It is estimated that about 80% of India’s GDP originates from districts which were classified under red and orange zones during the lockdown, where economic activity remained severely constrained. Correspondingly, India’s GDP is likely to contract in FY21, which would be the first such instance in over four decades,"" Birla said in a letter to shareholders. Given the fog of uncertainty all around, it is hard to be prescient in these times, Birla said. A stringent national lockdown to slow the spread of the pandemic started in the last week of FY2020 and remained active to varying degrees in different geographies through most of the first quarter of 2020-21. ""But there is little doubt on one reality: companies with quality leadership, sound business fundamentals, and a track record of winning in turbulent times, will emerge as champions in the new global order,"" he said. This year will see an economic contraction, but this 2020 recession is turning out very different from the past recessions, Birla said. ""It has been too sudden – almost off the cliff; its spread has been all-encompassing –affecting almost every economy and sector, and the plunge in economic activity levels and employment has been unprecedented,"" he said. On the positive side, this recession is likely to be one of the shortest, assuming no second wave of the pandemic recurs. As present lockdowns around the world get lifted, and businesses reopen, economic activity is likely to bounce back fairly quickly, he said. ""Around USD 9-trillion stimulus from different governments globally will help to support this recovery, along with the monetary actions by central banks. These policies will also help to restrict the second-order effects like defaults and bankruptcies,"" Birla said. Some scars of the crisis will remain in the form of subdued consumer and business confidence. Some sectors, like airlines and hospitality, will take time to recover fully. And some supply chain disruption effects will linger. As the world emerges from the current crisis, the next few years are likely to be marked by lack of buoyancy in growth, subdued commodity prices and inflation, a cautious trend in project investments, heightened risks of de-globalisation and political uncertainty; and increased dependence of financial systems on ultra-loose monetary policy conditions, Birla said. ""We will also have to watch out for potential post-Covid changes in consumer behaviour (such as more virtual engagements) and of operating models of organisations (such as work-from-home norms, diversification of supply chain risks, more use of e-commerce),"" he said.

Updated: 14 Aug 2020,Hindalco reports Q1 net loss of ₹709 crore,https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/hindalco-reports-q1-net-loss-of-rs-709-crore-11597402972275.html,"i Hindalco Industries Ltd reported a consolidated net loss of ₹709 crore in the June quarter, weighed down by exceptional items. It had posted a net profit of ₹1,063 crore in the year-ago period. “Q1 consolidated PAT (profit after tax) for continuing businesses before tax-effected exceptional and special items stood at ₹139 crore,"" it said. For the India aluminium business, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization (Ebitda) stood at ₹856 crore in Q1, compared with ₹853 crore in the year-ago. With smelter utilization at 90%, the domestic aluminium business produced 291 kilo tonnes of aluminium metal compared to 326 Kt in the year-ago. Aluminium metal sales were at 303 Kt in Q1FY21, down 5% year-on-year due to subdued demand, but was offset by higher exports. Copper cathode production in Q1FY21 was impacted by covid-led disruptions, leading to 46% lower production to 41 Kt. Hindalco’s US subsidiary Novelis recorded a quarterly adjusted Ebitda of $253 million in Q1FY21 compared to $372 million in the year-ago due to lower shipments and unfavourable product mix, However, this was partially offset by good cost control measures and Ebitda contribution from the Aleris business. “I am pleased at our ability to forge ahead despite the weak post-covid market scenario...We maintained our sales volumes, with exports accounting for nearly 80% of sales. This performance led to our Indian aluminium business recording an industry-high Ebitda margin,"" said Satish Pai, managing director, Hindalco Industries. Pai said the capital expenditure for Hindalco will be ₹1,500 crore for the year, while overseas expenditure will be at $450 million for both Aleris and Novelis, compared to the earlier expenditure plans of $500 million for Novelis alone."

The company had posted a profit after tax (PAT) of ₹1,063 crore in the April-June quarter a year ago. It said that ""Q1 consolidated PAT for continuing businesses before tax-effected exceptional and special items stood at ₹139 crore"". The Aditya Birla Group firm in a statement said that ""on account of certain special items, including charitable contributions towards COVID relief, ex-gratia paid to employees for their contribution during COVID, and Aleris acquisition costs, the reported PAT was impacted"". The company, as a consequence, reported a loss of ₹709 crore for the quarter. ""This also includes ₹140 crore loss attributed to operations of Novelis (Lewisport and Duffel) that are in the process of divestiture,"" it said. Its consolidated revenue from operations during the April-June quarter dropped to ₹25,283 crore, from over ₹29, 972 crore in Q1 FY2019-20. Hindalco Industries Managing Director Satish Pai said, ""I am pleased at our ability to forge ahead despite the weak post-COVID market scenario. All our aluminium India smelters operated at more than 90 per cent capacity during the lockdown."" ""We maintained our sales volumes, with exports accounting for nearly 80 per cent of sales. This performance led to our Indian aluminium business recording an industry-high EBITDA margin,"" he added. Novelis also delivered an industry-high EBITDA per tonne, amidst a challenging business environment, partly due to strong contribution by Aleris. Novelis' automotive customers across regions are trending upwards, towards reaching pre-pandemic production levels, with record automotive shipments in China, the company said. ""We are seeing green shoots both in domestic and international markets and we are ready to handle the rise in demand,"" the statement said. In a statement, the company which is a global leader in aluminium and copper said that it reported steady quarterly results, driven by a strong performance by India aluminium business, supported by lower input costs, stability in operations, and cost-saving actions. After four consecutive years of record earnings, Novelis reported a net income (excluding tax-effected items) of USD 22 million in Q1 FY'21. While Novelis’ financial results were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, its performance was steadied by beverage can market resiliency and encouraged by the upward monthly demand trend in the automotive and specialty markets. With regard to alumunium business in India, it said all smelters and major refineries continued to operate during the lockdown. Reported revenue of ₹4,436 crore in the first quarter over ₹5,490 crore in Q1 FY'20 was down 19 per cent due to lower aluminium prices. With smelter utilisation at 90 per cent in Q1 FY'21, Indian aluminium business achieved aluminium metal production of 2,91,000 tonnes. The company's copper cathode production in the first quarter of FY'21 was impacted by disruptions in operations due to COVID-19, leading to lower production at 41,000 tonnes, down 46 per cent. Hindalco has been mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic through planned initiatives, along with strict precautionary actions to protect its people and operations. All the aluminium smelters and major refineries operated at near full-scale. Its downstream plants operated at optimal capacity to meet existing market demand. The Indian aluminium operations exported nearly 80 per cent of its production and maintained its sales volumes. To keep its cash position strong against market volatility, the company implemented various cost-saving measures by optimising expenditure. When lockdown restrictions started easing in phases, Hindalco exercised utmost caution and continued to operate its plants with minimal staff and stringent safety measures in place. Early in the quarter, Novelis had to temporarily shut down some of its facilities to align with customer demand and reduce operating costs. However, as many customers resumed production in May, Novelis was able to safely and reliably ramp back production to meet increasing order levels. Now, all of its plants are operational and many are running at almost full capacity utilisation, the statement said. Novelis completed the acquisition of Aleris on April 14, and the integration process has begun. Divestment procedures for automotive assets in Lewisport in the US and Duffel in Europe are underway, the company said. Hindalco Industries is the metals flagship company of the Aditya Birla Group. A 16.7 billion dollar metals powerhouse, Hindalco is the world’s largest aluminium rolling and recycling company, and a major player in copper. It is also one of Asia’s largest producers of primary aluminium. PTI SID MKJ MKJ"

Novelis Inc.’s beverage can production seems to be immune to the pandemic and may shore up parent Hindalco Industries’ (consolidated) operations. After a 40% fall year to date, the Hindalco scrip has recovered 17% in the past week. Novelis’s contribution to its parent’s profitability is significant, accounting for about 70% of Hindalco’s consolidated Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization). Hence, a disruption in its US business would have naturally hit Hindalco’s operating leverage quite hard. However, beverage cans constitute 63% of Novelis’s volumes, which is expected to provide support. And demand for aluminium cans is rising due to an increase in in-house consumption. Outdoor consumption, though, has been crushed. Elsewhere, demand for beverage cans, particularly in Europe and Asia remains muted. “Covid-19 has had a huge impact only on Novelis’ auto segment (20% of its FY20 volume mix), whereas the beverage-can division has largely been unaffected,"" said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a note to clients.  Nevertheless, lack of growth in its other divisions, such as auto and speciality metals, would crimp overall operating profit. The high-margin auto division could still drag down overall volumes by 10% in the US. Covid-19 lockdowns have brought auto lines in the US to a screeching halt. And the aerospace industry is going through a tumultuous patch, putting serious strain on Novelis’s speciality metals division. But debt servicing remains manageable despite the conditions. “Novelis remains isolated from the pandemic due to strong growth from the can business, and interest coverage remains healthy. The company is sitting on high liquidity with negligible repayments in FY21-22E,"" said Siddharth Gadekar, analyst (institutional equities) at Equirus Securities Pvt. Ltd. Analysts have currently pegged the enterprise value-to-Ebitda at about four times for FY22, a shade lower than its past averages."

Updated: 11 Nov 2019,Aditya Birla Group expects Aleris deal to close by 21 January,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/aditya-birla-group-faces-forced-sale-of-second-aleris-asset-11573481018586.html,"NEW DELHI : Aditya Birla Group’s Novelis Inc., which is facing an anti-trust lawsuit in the US over its acquisition of Aleris Corp., expects to close the deal by 21 January—the outside date under the original merger agreement, said a top company official. Last month, the US justice department filed a lawsuit to stop Novelis Inc.’s proposed $2.58 billion purchase of Aleris because of concerns over higher prices of aluminium sheet used to make cars. In its lawsuit, the justice department described Ohio-based Aleris as an “aggressive competitor"" and said the deal will give Novelis, the US-based unit of Hindalco Industries Ltd, up to 60% of the projected domestic capacity. “In the US, we have signed a consent decree with the Department of Justice,"" said Satish Pai, managing director, Hindalco. “We will prove then through litigation and, if needed, the arbitration process, that aluminium and steel is one market (for the auto industry) in the US."" Negotiations between Novelis and the justice department currently hinge on the rolling mill at Lewisport, Kentucky, and its 200 kilotonne (kt) automotive finishing line. Novelis has argued that the justice department’s lawsuit “ignores competition from steel automotive body sheet, even though steel automotive body sheet is currently used for nearly 90% of the market"". On 1 October, the European Commission approved Novelis’ proposed acquisition of Aleris, a maker of aluminium rolled products, with 13 facilities across North America, Europe and China. The approval is conditional on the sale of Aleris’s plant in Duffel, Belgium, which produces aluminium for the automotive and specialities markets. Pai said he expects to close the sale of the 180kt Duffel plant by November-end and that the company is in talks with a couple of interested local buyers. Regulatory approvals in China will be sought after the European Commission is satisfied with the plant sale and gives its final approval. Pai said the sale of the Duffel plant, and “the unlikely event that we will have to sell Lewisport"" will bring down the cost of the Aleris acquisition proportionately. The Lewisport plant has a 200kt auto facility and a 350kt hot strip mill. The Duffel plant, slated for sale, has an auto facility of 80kt and a 100kt capacity in specialities. Hindalco announced in July last year it would acquire Aleris through Novelis for $2.58 billion. Hindalco has arranged for $775 million of equity financing through a 5-year facility and a $1.5 billion of debt through a one-year bridge loan. On Monday, Hindalco, which houses the metals business of the Aditya Birla group, reported a 33% fall in consolidated net profit in the September quarter. Weak metal prices led to an 8.4% fall in operating revenue to ₹3,918 crore from ₹4,276 crore a year earlier. Net profit was also hit by a one-time loss of ₹256 crore on the shutdown of a plant in Germany and restructuring expenses at Muri alumina refinery. “We’re seeing the government is seized of the matter and are announcing a range of initiatives,"" Pai said adding “We are hoping to see projects from Power Grid and orders from infrastructure, building and construction to pick up."" Hindalco has cut its capital expenditure plans for the second time this year, from ₹2,600 crore to ₹2,000 crore. September quarter revenue fell 9% to ₹29,657 crore on account of lower average base aluminium prices and local market premiums, partially offset by higher total shipments and favourable product price and mix. Shares of Hindalco Industries fell 1.8% to ₹200.40 on BSE on Monday underperforming the benchmark index Sensex that remained almost unchanged at 40,345.08 points."

Consolidated net profit for the quarter stood at ₹974 crore as against ₹1,448 crore a year ago. Revenues fell 9% to ₹29,657 crore on account of decrease in average base aluminium prices and local market premiums, partially offset by higher total shipments and favorable product price and mix. Its US arm Novelis reported 6% increase in earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation to ₹2,629 crore in September quarter from ₹2,485 crore a year ago. The EBITDA rose on account of higher shipments, favorable price and product mix, partially offset by less favorable recycling benefits due to lower aluminium prices. Shares of Hindalco Industries on BSE fell 1.8% on Monday to ₹200.40 while India's benchmark Sensex Index rose 0.05% to 40345.08 points."
Updated: 12 Aug 2019,Domestic business profit squeeze to keep a cap on Hindalco’s stock,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/domestic-business-profit-squeeze-to-keep-a-cap-on-hindalco-s-stock-1565533076827.html,"Shares of Hindalco Industries Ltd hit an air pocket soon after the company its lower-than-anticipated first-quarter results. The stock caved in after the results were announced, losing about 2% on Friday. The domestic business has been weighed down by lower realizations and higher costs. Despite the fact that the company reported stable aluminium production, stand-alone revenue dropped 5.7% in the June quarter. Aluminium metal sales, however, were up 7% from a year ago. Copper sales were sluggish and remained just about the same as last year, but it was still lower than what analysts pencilled in. Higher sales of aluminium and value-added products were expected to buoy its performance. But that did not happen. Aluminium and metal realizations were considerably low for its domestic arm. A sharp drop in global metal prices have impacted its business. Higher imports have also hit the domestic business. As a result, the company’s aluminium division saw a huge fall in Ebitda by 42% due to lower realizations. Ebitda is earnings before, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. In its copper business, sales of value-added products were up 3% from a year ago. But here, too, sluggish volumes and realizations have been weighing down performance. This pulled down its copper division Ebitda by 23%. Margin improvement was likely to come through cost efficiencies, value-added products and better product mix. This was also not visible. Ebitda margins, in fact, contracted to 12.7% as against 18.3% in a year ago. To be sure, Hindalco’s overseas unit has seen a decent pickup in business. Shipments at Novelis Inc. rose 4% year-on-year. The 6% revenue fall due to a decrease in base aluminium prices was partially offset by higher shipments and a better product mix. That did perk up its US unit’s Ebitda by 11%. Nevertheless, it is the local business that has been bogged down by the liquidity crunch and general slowdown. So much so, that Hindalco’s stand-alone business, including Utkal Alumina, saw its net profit drop by a whopping 77%. Analysts say that incremental growth for the company is not visible, with imports hurting the domestic business. A volume pickup is crucial for the company, going forward. However, given the slowdown in the auto sector, that appears difficult. A pickup in international aluminium prices is also needed, but with worries of a looming global slowdown, by how much prices rise remains to be seen. A sharper focus on cost-control and improving product mix is needed, or Hindalco’s stock price might continue to meander for now."
Updated: 16 May 2019,Hindalco Industries bears the scars of price pressures in Q4,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/hindalco-industries-bears-the-scars-of-price-pressures-in-q4-1558027728208.html,"On the face of it, the March quarter results of Hindalco Industries Ltd look decent. Revenues at the stand-alone firm, including Utkal Alumina, rose 4.3% sequentially despite a notable drop in product prices. Even the drop of 10% in operating profit was lower than expected. However, the performance looks weaker if looked at more closely. Much of the boost in the operating income came from a spurt in other income, which jumped 79% sequentially. Exclude this and sequential operating profit will fall 20%, which is not materially better than Street estimates. Revenues at the aluminium unit dropped just 1% despite a notable fall in aluminium prices. This is because of the benefits of business hedges—a portion of volumes were pre-booked at higher prices. However, this yielded no major benefit. Operating profits dropped 18.9% sequentially. Low realizations and adverse currency movement impacted operating profit, according to the company. However, analysts also blame higher operating costs for the steep fall in operating profits. The performance in the copper business, on the other hand, was impacted by lower production and treatment and refining charges. As a result, operating profit dropped 26.9% sequentially. The management expects output at the copper division to be impacted because of plant shutdowns in Q1, but it expects production to scale up in the rest of the fiscal year, making up for the loss. Importantly, the management sees incrementally lower costs at the aluminium business. Coal availability is better than a year ago and prices in the global and domestic spot markets are softer. The global aluminium market is expected to be in deficit (production versus demand) this year, sending inventories to a multi-year low. Global demand for refined copper is estimated to rise 2% in 2019, with demand for copper concentrate outstripping production. However, uncertainty in the global economy and trade tensions are an overhang over metals producers. Aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange are down 2.3% over the past month. The company, meanwhile, is strengthening its balance sheet. Consolidated net debt to Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) eased to 2.48 times as it prepaid some loans. The US unit Novelis reported better-than-expected results for the March quarter, tracking demand traction in user industries. However, the performance did not count for much as far as the Hindalco stock goes, as trade tensions between the US and China overshadowed investor sentiments."

The company had posted a standalone profit of ₹376.97 crore in the year-ago period, Hindalco Industries said in a filing to BSE. However, the company's standalone income during January-March quarter increased to ₹12,733.23 crore, over ₹11,892.06 crore a year ago. Hindalco Industries Ltd is a global major in aluminium and copper. In the statement, the company said, ""PAT (profit after tax) for Q4 FY19 stood at ₹506 crore ( ₹616 crore in Q4 FY18), primarily due to weaker macros and higher input costs in the last quarter."" The consolidated profit 2018-19 fell to ₹5,495.01 crore, over ₹6,082.87 crore in the year ended 31 March, 2018. The company's board of directors ""recommended dividend at 120% i.e. ₹1.20 per equity share of face value of Re 1 each for the financial year ended 31 March, 2019, subject to approval of the shareholders at the ensuing annual general meeting,"" the filing said. ""Our FY19 consolidated profits reached an all-time high in spite of a difficult business environment. This resilient performance reflects the strength of our integrated business model, excellent operational capabilities, stable operations and our enriched product portfolio,"" said Satish Pai, managing director at Hindalco Industries. ""Novelis' innovative products and customer-centric approach helped it deliver its best-ever performance. In India, our increased focus on downstream is already showing encouraging results with record aluminium value-added product volumes this year. In copper, too, the share of value-added products (copper rods) has risen, helping the business maintain profitability despite lower volumes,"" Pai added. He said the company expects the impetus provided by India's growth to boost demand for aluminium. ""Rising imports of aluminium and copper, however, pose a threat and we look forward to suitable steps to provide a level-playing field,"" he added. Shares of the company were trading up by 1.57% at ₹193.95 apiece on the BSE. This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text."

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, with both Australia and South Korea little changed. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.6%, with banks hurt by weak earnings. On Wednesday, Wall Street shares extended their rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 0.58% and the MSCI's broadest gauge of world stocks bouncing back from a two-month low hit on Tuesday. The uptick came after three administration officials told Reuters on Wednesday that Trump is expected to delay a decision on tariffs on imported cars and parts by up to six months. Also on Wednesday, less than a week after Washington slapped higher tariffs on $250 billion imports from China, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he will likely travel to Beijing soon to continue negotiations with Chinese counterparts. Back home, companies that will declare their March quarter results today include Hindalco Industries, Bank of India, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance, JSW Energy and Shree Renuka Sugars. Tata group stocks may be in focus in trade today. Tata Global Beverages Ltd is acquiring all the branded food businesses from Tata Chemicals Ltd in an all-stock transaction that is aimed at creating a consumer business company with revenues of ₹9,099 crore. As part of the deal, shareholders of Tata Chemicals will get 1.14 new shares of Tata Global for every share held, the company said in an exchange filing on Wednesday. The transaction values the consumer business of Tata Chemicals at around ₹5,800 crore. Post the acquisition, Tata Chemicals will own a 31.5% stake in Tata Global Beverages. Meanwhile, oil prices edged up on the prospect of mounting tensions in the Middle East hitting global supplies despite an unexpected build in US crude inventories. Brent crude rose 0.7% to $72.25 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fetched $62.45 a barrel, up 0.7%. The United States pulled staff from its embassy in Baghdad on Wednesday out of apparent concern about perceived threats from Iran. The sabotage of the tankers, for which no one has claimed responsibility, and Saudi Arabia's announcement on Tuesday that armed drones hit two of its oil pumping stations have raised concerns Washington and Tehran may be inching toward conflict.
