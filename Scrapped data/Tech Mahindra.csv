Updated: 05 Jul 2022,IT services firms likely to report strong revenue in Q1,https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/it-services-firms-likely-to-report-strong-revenue-in-q1-11657042305039.html,"BENGALURU :   Top Indian IT services companies are expected to report strong revenue growth of 2.3-4.3% quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q) in constant currency during the fiscal first quarter ended June, according to analysts. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) will kick off the earnings season on Friday. However, the peak revenue growth of these companies is likely to be behind them and the momentum is expected to start softening from H2 FY23 due to absence of large deal wins and clients postponing their technology spends. While the long-term demand environment remains unaltered, elevated inflation and an economic slowdown in the US and Europe is likely to impede growth in the second half of the fiscal. “We anticipate Infosys to lead on organic revenue front with growth of 4.3% QoQ in constant currency, followed by TCS at 3.6% QoQ in constant currency. Growth in Tech Mahindra, Wipro and HCL Technologies is expected to be soft due to seasonal weakness and moderation in demand,"" ICICI Securities said in a pre-earnings note. Margins are likely to be under pressure due to wage hikes, higher backfilling costs, increase in travel/visa/other discretionary costs with the easing of travel restrictions, and back-to-office trends, said Emkay Research. “Due to cross-currency headwinds, benefits from rupee depreciation will be marginal in Q1."" The brokerage firm expects Infosys to retain its annual revenue growth guidance of 13-15% in constant currency and EBIT margin guidance of 21-23% for FY23. HCL Technologies is also likely to retain its 12-14% revenue growth and 18-20% EBIT margin guidance range. Wipro should guide for a 2.5-4.5% sequential growth in constant currency with Rizing adding about 1% incrementally for Q2 FY23. In the absence of large deal wins, smaller deals will drive deal intake in the June quarter. “ACV (annual contract value) of signed deals to remain strong. We expect the deal intake to remain healthy across companies in Q1, with an uptick in smaller deals (led by clients’ urgency to execute digital transformation deals quickly) driven by increased demand for cloud adoption, digital transformation and customer experience transformation deals,"" Emkay Research said."

Updated: 14 Jun 2022,"Sensex ends in the red, Nifty below 15,750; oil and gas stocks top drags",https://www.livemint.com/market/live-blog/share-market-live-updates-sensex-nifty-bse-nse-stock-market-today-14-06-2022-ril-viacom-ipl-zomato-srei-11655171309721.html,"India's equity markets were volatile on Tuesday, swinging between gains and losses. Investors now await the US Fed's next policy announcement, due Wednesday, for clues on how aggressive the central bank intends to be in raising rates.  India's benchmark equity indices ended Tuesday lower, but off lows, tracking global peers and as domestic inflation data cemented the case for more rate hikes, going ahead. High global energy and raw material prices combined with a weak rupee fuelled the fastest annual rise in India's annual wholesale price-based inflation to 15.88% in May. US equity futures pared gains on Tuesday and a rebound in European stocks proved short-lived, suggesting markets aren’t out of the woods after a rout driven by expectations of sharper Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes to fight inflation. Back home, the benchmark Sensex fell 153.13 points to end the session at 52,693.57, while the Nifty was down 42.30 points at 15,732.10.  Realty, metal indices rose, while auto and oil and gas stocks fell. The midcaps and the smallcaps also ended with minor cuts.   High global energy and raw material prices combined with a weak rupee fueled the fastest annual rise in India's wholesale prices in more than 30 years, raising expectations for the central bank to order more interest rate hikes. A surge in crude oil and commodity prices since Russia invaded Ukraine in February has set inflation alight in many countries, forcing central banks to raise interest rates. Wholesale prices, akin to producer prices, climbed 15.88% in May from year ago levels, staying in double-digits for a 14th straight month, and was, according to economists, India's highest since September 1991.   Aviation regulator DGCA on Tuesday said it has imposed a fine of ₹10 lakh on Air India for denying boarding to passengers holding valid tickets and thereafter not providing mandatory compensation to them. ""After that a series of checks were carried out by DGCA and during our surveillance at Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Delhi, there were specific instances, in the case of Air India - where the regulation (regarding compensation to passengers) is not being followed and therefore, a show cause notice was issued to the airline and also a personal hearing was afforded,"" the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said in a statement. According to the regulator, Air India may not have a policy in this regard and does not pay compensation to the passengers.   The U.S. dollar consolidated gains near a 20-year peak on Tuesday while its rivals from the Aussie to the euro nursed steep losses as traders braced for aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve this week. Expectations for a 75 basis-point increase at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday are nearly baked into prices, according to CME's Fedwatch Tool with investment banks like Goldman Sachs expecting a 75 basis-point rate hike in June and July, and a 50 basis-point rise in September. A 75 basis-point increase would be the biggest since 1994 and with world stock markets nursing deep losses, the dollar's appeal as a safe-haven asset is also boosting its allure.   The Indian government’s spending on information technology is expected to grow 12.1% to $9.5 billion in 2022, far higher than the 5% rise globally, according to Gartner, Inc. The research firm estimates government IT spends for the year globally to touch $565.7 billion. “Contrary to the worldwide spending, all segments will experience growth in India in 2022,"" Apeksha Kaushik, principal analyst, Gartner, said in an interview.  Global geopolitical tensions and looming recession in the US are not expected to have much impact on India, she added. While software spends by the Union government will grow at the fastest pace globally at a record 28% and cross the $2 billion mark in 2022, IT services is likely to post 13.4% growth to hit $2.4 billion.     European stocks edged higher from their lowest level in over a year as investors bought the dip after a global rout sparked by worries of aggressive central bank policy tightening amid stubbornly high inflation. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was up 0.3% after slumping Monday to its lowest since March 2021. Banks led the advance with rate-sensitive sectors outperforming following a dip in Treasury yields. Insurance and energy stocks also rose, while real estate declined.   Bajaj Finance Limited, the lending and investing arm of Bajaj Finserv, has increased the interest rates on its fixed deposit (FD) programme by up to 20 basis points (bps), for tenors between 24 to 60 months (except 44 months).    Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked various government departments and ministries to undertake the recruitment of 10 lakh people on a ""mission mode"" in the next year and a half, his office said on Tuesday. The direction from Modi came following a review of the status of human resources in all government departments and ministries, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said. The government's decision comes amid the opposition's frequent criticism of it on the issue of unemployment. A large number of vacant posts in different government sectors has often been flagged.   India's palm oil imports in May fell 10% from a month ago as top producer Indonesia curbed exports of the edible oil, a trade body said on Tuesday. The south Asian country is the world's biggest importer of vegetable oils and lower purchases could weigh on Malaysian palm oil futures. India imported 514,022 tonnes of palm oil in May, down from 572,508 tonnes in April, according to the Solvent Extractors' Association (SEA) of India. Indonesia, the world's biggest producer and exporter of palm oil, on April 28 halted exports of the product to control soaring prices at home. Jakarta allowed exports to resume from May 23, but put in place policies to safeguard domestic supplies. Indian refiners in May sourced more palm oil from Malaysia, Thailand and Papua New Guinea, but still the overall imports were down, the SEA said.   Nifty The Nifty began the new week with heavy losses amid weak global cues and closed below 15800 level. All sectoral indices closed deep in the red with IT, media and metal being top losers. Ahead of the FOMC meeting, we expect the Nifty to remain subdued. It may face resistance at higher levels due to aggressive writing at ATM and OTM Call strikes. Bank Nifty The Bank Nifty also witnessed selling pressure in line with the Nifty and closed with a loss of more than 1100 points. Looking at options data, the Bank Nifty’s immediate support is at 33000 while on the higher side, 34000 Call strike will act as resistance and limit upside gains.     Inspite of a strong demand outlook for IT services providers, worsening global macro economic scenario raises concern of a recession. For IT sector, this could translate into lower client spending, thus weighing on demand pipeline beyond FY23. Striking a note of caution, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said, ""Profit warning from clients of IT companies and increasing external risks makes the assumption of 6-8% global IT spending growth, unreasonable. We moderate our stance and bake in normalized global IT spending growth of 3-4% for CY2023E and 7% for CY2022E."" (Read here)   Nifty is currently trading at 20.7x 1-year forward EPS which is 1% discount to 10 year average of 20.9x Past 3 major corrections show that NIFTY has bottomed out around 10 year average PE except in March 20, when it bottomed out at 23% discount to 10 year average.  -- Base Case we value NIFTY at 10 year av.

However we remain positive on India growth given strong tailwinds and expect positive returns by end of FY23  Downgrades outweigh upgrades by 2.25:1 -- Major Rating Upgrade: Avenue Supermart, Jubilant Foods, Hindalco, JK Lakshmi, Aarti Inds, LIC Housing and Chola. -- Rating Downgrade: Ambuja Cement, Bayer, Avaas Housing, LTTS, HCL, Tata Steel, JSPL, JSW Steel, IOC and Lupin -- Major Estimates Upgrade - M&M, SBI, Chola, Ambuja cement, Fine Org, and IOC -- Estimate Downgrade - HDFC, HDFC Bank, Muthoot, Ramco Cement, Kansai, Apollo Hospital, NH, Infy, Wipro, Zeel, Tata Steel, JSPL, JSW, SAIL, GAIL, IOC, Aurobindo and Lupin.   French energy company TotalEnergies said on Tuesday it has agreed to buy a 25% stake in Adani New Industries Limited (ANIL) as part of a deal to form a new green hydrogen project in India with the Adani company. TotalEnergies, one of the world's biggest oil and gas producers, has faced criticism from climate activists and has been moving into the renewable energy sector and diversifying away from hydrocarbon-centred activities in recent years.   Indonesia on Tuesday issued regulations backing recently announced changes on a palm oil export tax policy, including cutting the maximum levy rate to accelerate shipments that have been slow to rebound after the ending of an export ban. But the levy rate will be raised in August, according to the finance ministry regulations, sparking concerns from an industry group. Indonesia, the world's biggest palm oil exporter, allowed palm shipments to resume from May 23 following a three-week export ban designed to boost cooking oil stocks and keep runaway local prices in check. Authorities have since launched an export acceleration programme and tweaked tax rules after shipments were slow to restart amid confusion over procedural issues. Details of Tuesday's regulations were in line with previous announcements, including lowering the maximum levy rate for crude palm oil to $200 a tonne from $375, effective until 31 July.   Bitcoin extended declines on Tuesday as investor sentiment took another leg down over fears that bigger Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes loom to quell inflation. The world’s largest digital token shed as much as 10.3% to reach $20,824, the lowest level since December 2020. A range of other tokens from Ether to Avalanche were also nursing losses.   Gold hovered near a four-week low on Tuesday, as some bears looked to book profits, but prices remained largely pressured by a strong dollar and investors dumping bullion to cover for losses in other assets. Amid prospects of aggressive monetary policy tightening, spot gold rose 0.4% to $1,825.97 per ounce, in Asian deals, after falling to its lowest since May 19 at $1,810.90 earlier in the session.   The market crashed with full force on the first day of the week, as benchmark indices slumped below their crucial levels on across-the-board selling pressure. There have been heightened concerns amongst investors that central banks will be more aggressive in the coming months to hike interest rate hikes in order to combat inflation, which will in turn hurt economic growth and put margins under pressure. Markets were also down due to continued strength in Brent crude prices, 10-year bond yields rising to 3.20% from recent lows of 2.80%, and the expected CPI numbers. The fear and uncertainty was clearly visible in India's VIX, which is up over 15% at 22.50.  Technically, if the Nifty breaks and closes below 15700, it will be a major downside event for the market. In such a situation, the index would fall to the level of 15500-15400 in the short term. It is advisable to reduce a weak long position below the 15700 level. Also, Bank Nifty could drop to 32000 level if it ends below 33500.   Oil prices seesawed in positive and negative territory on Tuesday, holding up despite recession fears and potential new COVID-19 curbs in China that could dampen demand as the market remains tightly supplied. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude eased 4 cents to $120.89 a barrel in early deals, while Brent crude futures dipped 6 cents to $122.21 a barrel.   Retail inflation eased in May from the eight-year high it hit the previous month but remained well above the central bank’s upper tolerance level, adding pressure on policymakers to tame unrelenting price rise. Consumer Price Index inflation moderated to 7.04% in May from 7.79% in April, helped by slower increases in food prices, data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) showed on Monday.

Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange fell 117.50 points, or 0.74%, to 15,661.00 in early deals on Tuesday, indicating a negative start for Indian benchmarks. India's benchmark equity indices slumped over 2.5% on Monday amid a sell-off in global markets. The rupee plunged 20 paise to close at an all-time low of 78.13 against the US dollar, as a lacklustre trend in domestic equities and stronger greenback overseas weighed on investor sentiment. The Sensex fell 1,456.74 points to end the day at 52,846.70, having touched an intraday low of 52,527.08. The Nifty was down 427.40 points or 2.64% at 15,774.40.    Asian shares tumbled on Tuesday after Wall Street hit a confirmed bear market milestone and bond yields struck a two-decade high on fears aggressive U.S. interest rate hikes would push the world's largest economy into recession. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.9%. Australian shares S&P/ASX200 sank 5% in early trade, while Japan's Nikkei stock index was down 1.74%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index slipped 1.44% and China's CSI300 Index was down nearly 1% at open. US futures steadied in the wake of a three-day rout in the S&P 500 of nearly 9%. Robust earnings from technology bellwether Oracle Corp. lifted battered tech shares in extended US trading. On the Wall Street on Monday, the S&P 500 fell 151.23 points to 3,749.63 and dropped 21.8% below its record set early this year to put it into what investors call a bear market. The S&P 500 has lost nearly 9% in just three days. That’s its worst such stretch since the earliest days of the coronavirus crash in March 2020.  The Dow lost 876.05, or 2.8%, to 30,516.74 on Monday, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 530.80, or 4.7% to 10,809.23.  "

The correction can be attributed to headwinds of slowing revenue growth, reduced margins, elevated consensus expectations and of course stretched stock valuations, in addition to a weak macro environment. “We do believe valuations have contracted materially, but the price paid for high earnings growth is still elevated. We strongly suggest to investors that deployment in Indian IT services segment should be very slow and gradual as we believe there will be many unknown risks ahead, which might further hamper the valuations,"" the note stated. The start of slowdown induced by central bank policy tightening is already being seen. Among mid-caps, it has retained pecking order: Coforge, MTCL and Persistent Systems. Among large-caps, the brokerage has recommended TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Wipro, Tech Mahindra. It has downgraded Mphasis' shares rating from Buy to Add. Further, given the recent sharp correction over the past month, the brokerage has upgraded its rating on Newgen to Buy. “Emphasis on costs will likely lead to dampening of tech budgets and reduce discretionary spend. Macro factors such as GDP, PMI, S&P 500 revenues and CEO confidence are worsening by the day,"" ICICI Securities added. ""We expect a ‘J line’ curve in cost items in the P&L in FY23/FY24. For example, travel costs, which accounted for 2-3% of revenues, are down to ~0.5% now. Going forward, we will also have to take into account the already high inflation, which might push travel costs (and other costs too) way higher than pre-covid levels,"" it added. ICICI Securities still believes the fallen stock prices have not yet fully captured all the headwinds on growth and margins.

Analysts at the global brokerage believe Infosys’ margin reset is early and calls out sector-wide factors giving it bandwidth to invest and maintain sector-leading growth. “We would Buy the IT stock on weakness for its structural strengths and see limited earnings risk from this level given its guidance track record. It stays the sector bellwether and the best way to play the current tech spending super-cycle, in our view,"" the note stated. On the other hand, JPM expects Tech Mahindra to grow 13% organic constant currency (CC) in FY23 – higher than Wipro (11.4%) and just below HCL Tech (13.2%), as attractively priced while valuations are undemanding. For Mphasis, the brokerage house expects it to be the fastest growing mid-cap IT name whose overall growth will be higher than peers as its headwind from DXC declines sharply. Mphasis’ industry exposure with dominant presence in BFSI makes it more defensive in a rising rates environment. It remains overweight as Persistent Systems' end verticals are the most defensive which can help sustain higher growth even in a macro slowdown. “While bottom-up commentary from Services, Software and SaaS names have remained very positive, macro indicators on Software GDP, US GDP, CEO confidence, and US PMIs have all turned negative,"" JPMorgan added in its note. The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint."

Shareholders of Mindtree will get 73 shares of LTI for every 100 held. Parent Larsen and Toubro Ltd will own 68.73% of LTI Mindtree, as the merged entity will be known. The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. The merged entity will be valued at ₹1.35 trillion at Friday’s share prices, surpassing Tech Mahindra’s ₹1.25 trillion market capitalization. Mindtree chief executive and managing director Debashis Chatterjee will lead the combined entity, while LTI’s chief executive Sanjay Jalona resigned, citing personal reasons. He will serve his notice period but will not stay on to oversee the integration. The proposed merger will create an entity with combined sales of $3.5 billion that will be able to bid for bigger orders and offer a wider range of services to clients, given larger customers’ preference for hiring fewer vendors that can offer end-to-end services. The merger makes sense at multiple levels, according to Abhisek Mukherjee, co-founder and director of management consulting firm Auctus Advisors. “Other than their complementary portfolios, it will create a meaningful scale for the combined entity. Scale is becoming a prerequisite to qualify for and win large deals, which is the holy grail for all IT services companies. Better access and conversion of large deals by the combined entity is something to watch out for. This will drive both revenue and margin expansion,"" he said. On the flip side, organizational turbulence is something that challenges such mergers of equals, Mukherjee said. “Both LTI and Mindtree have deep leadership strength, and how potential overlaps are managed will determine how quickly the combined entity stabilizes,"" he said. On Friday, shares of Mindtree fell 3.9% to ₹3,374.65 while those of LTI declined 3.6% to ₹4,593.10 on BSE. The merger comes at a time technology services companies face record employee turnover as rivals try to lure workers with bigger paycheques and promotions, as customers continue to digitize their businesses to meet the challenges of doing business in the post-pandemic era. Larsen and Toubro said LTI and Mindtree’s complementary strengths would result in a stronger portfolio of offerings. “This merger represents our continued commitment to growing the IT services business, in line with our strategic vision. The highly complementary businesses of LTI and Mindtree will make this integration a ‘win-win’ proposition for our customers, investors, shareholders, and employees,"" said A.M. Naik, group chairman of Larsen and Toubro. Larsen and Toubro acquired Mindtree in 2019, marking the first hostile takeover of a company in India’s IT industry. The founders of the Bengaluru-based Mindtree initially resisted the takeover but couldn’t prevent the Mumbai-based company from acquiring a controlling stake. Mindtree’s profit rose 49.1% from a year ago to ₹473.1 crore in the March quarter, while revenue gained 37.4% to ₹2,897.4 crore. Meanwhile, LTI’s profit increased by 16.8% to ₹637.5 crore and revenue jumped 31.6% to ₹4,301.6 crore."

The Bengaluru-based IT services company will be merged with Larsen and Toubro Infotech (LTI), another listed IT services company of the engineering conglomerate, Bloomberg has reported, citing people familiar with the development. Many observers, including Mint, had said at the time L&T bought Mindtree in the summer of 2019 that its merger with LTI could pose risk, the two being culturally diverse companies; as though marrying a horse-power driven organization with a one that works on brain-power, that too in the mode of startups. And so, that the board of L&T avoided rushing into merging all the IT businesses suggests a careful, calibrated approach. The immediate question that comes to mind concerns L&T Technology Services Ltd, the smallest IT firm but with a larger share of the giant’s products and platforms business. Will it be merged with Mindtree and LTI? Ideally, it should be. L&T owns 74.05% of the shareholding of LTI, the largest of the three IT services companies it owns, while it owns 61% of the shares of Mindtree.

Giving broader outlook of NSE Nifty index; Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com said, ""Tuesday's low of 16,840 coincides with the ‘200 EMA’ on the daily chart and 50 per cent retracement level of the previous upside move. If the index breaches this support, then we could see the index extend its correction towards 61.8 per cent retracement level which is placed around 16,600. On the flipside, 17,250 to 17,300 will now be seen as an immediate hurdle which needs to be surpassed for any strength to regain."" On day trading strategy for Wednesday; Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com said, ""Looking at the near term volatility, traders should avoid aggressive positions and look for stock specific opportunities on both the sides of the trade.""

It is also price competitive and cost competitive to an extent,"" he said. IBM’s expansion plans come on the back of many tech and startups moving beyond metros.

It is helping us attract talent,"" C.P. Gurnani, managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), Tech Mahindra had told Mint. “Very good talent"" is available in places such as Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, Kolkata, Indore, Vijayawada, and Coimbatore, Gurnani had said. However, this shift may not work for all industries. “Consumer and fast-moving consumer goods not only need office space and talent but also need access to supply chains. Tech and startups on the other hand can afford to have more flexible approaches to their work,"" said Aditya Narayan Mishra, director and CEO of CIEL HR Services. Mysuru, Coimbatore, and Visakhapatnam are some of the prominent cities where tech firms and startups are strengthening bases. Since inception, IBM India has its regional headquarters in Bengaluru and now has offices across many cities in India, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Pune. Another advantage of moving to smaller towns is the larger catchment from where companies can meet their diversity targets."

Updated: 17 Mar 2022,IT firms tap nascent metaverse to help clients explore its potential,https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/it-firms-tap-nascent-metaverse-to-help-clients-explore-its-potential-11647538963486.html,"BENGALURU : Indian IT companies are jumping on to the metaverse bandwagon amid a global move to the future virtual world. Last month, two of India’s leading IT services companies, Infosys Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd, announced their foray into the metaverse. Infosys launched a metaverse foundry to help its clients explore the potential of the nascent virtual universe. The foundry harnesses the power of technologies such as augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR), blockchain, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Internet of Things (IoT), applied AI (artificial intelligence), cybersecurity and 5G to deliver value in the metaverse. Infosys claims to have developed over 100 ready-to-apply use-cases and templates. For example, one template that is popular with many large enterprises is for setting up an immersive retail experience where shoppers can explore a branded metaverse environment, buy products as NFTs or connect to an online checkout counter to make purchases that are delivered in the physical world. “The physical and virtual worlds are already smoothly and ubiquitously interwoven. The metaverse will deepen this overlap and in very experiential ways that will create abundant space for business innovation,"" said Ravi Kumar S., president, Infosys. “We want to help our clients to quickly double down on those opportunities in a find-fast, learn-faster environment before they can reorient their own capabilities, processes and culture in-house to respond to this rapidly evolving space,"" he said. Tech Mahindra launched TechMVerse, its metaverse practice to deliver interactive and immersive experiences for its customers. In the initial phase, Tech Mahindra will leverage the opportunities presented by the metaverse through areas such as car dealership, NFT marketplace, virtual banking and gaming. Initially, the operations of TechMVerse will be spread across four hubs—Dallas, London, Pune and Hyderabad. “One of our key focus areas is helping our customers’ digital journey and technology is helping us build the differentiators. Metaverse is clearly a key differentiator. Like any other new technology, our metaverse offering will be initially incubated in a smaller group and then shared with our clients because for most of them, it is also a new way of running their business,"" said C.P. Gurnani, chief executive officer and managing director, Tech Mahindra. Sanchit Vir Gogia, CEO and chief analyst, Greyhound Research, believes the metaverse may soon take a “platformization"" approach with industry-specific applications. “The concept of the metaverse is not new for IT services companies such as Infosys, and a few others that have always offered it in bits and pieces through technologies such as experience redesign, digital twin, AI, IoT, AR/VR, blockchain, and 5G. The only difference is now it is being offered as a bundled offering with all elements stitched together and in a more distributed/decentralized model,"" he said. “We will see platformization of the metaverse with industry-specific pre-baked applications. But, as of today, it is still in its early days, and what these companies are doing today will look very different in the next few years,"" he added. The metaverse will evolve across three overlapping phases: emerging, advanced and mature, corroborates research and advisory firm Gartner. “The market is beginning to explore and experiment with applications and use-cases with high, long-term value… Between 2024 and 2027, more direct opportunities for the metaverse will arise,"" said Anushree Verma, senior principal analyst, Gartner. According to Verma, many of these opportunities will be focused on the content layer— data, information and foundation (non-infrastructure) of the metaverse itself."

For Infosys, the global brokerage believes strategic repositioning toward digital capabilities places Infosys well will drive strong client engagement and strong deal win momentum and market share gains to drive industry-leading growth. Jefferies' bullish stance on Tech Mahindra comes on the back of strong deal momentum and demand environment which will drive 12%+ YoYcc revenue growth CAGR over FY22-24E. ""Well positioned to leverage the upcoming 5G capex cycle. Valuations reasonable in context of the growth potential."" Meanwhile, the brokerage believes HCL Technologies is well-positioned to capitalise on growing spends on Cloud with a strong background in IMS services and investments in digital offerings, which should drive organic growth. Whereas, TCS should continue to maintain a strong growth profile and margin leadership among Tier-1 IT firms, as per Jefferies. “Double-digit revenue growth to sustain over FY22-24E. EBIT margin to be under pressure and to stay in a narrow band over FY22-24E. However, the growth seems priced in, and stock provides little valuation comfort,"" the note stated. Wipro has a long track record of underperformance and still in the early stages of a new strategy and its revenue growth will still lag peers in FY22-24E with margins under pressure from continued investments and supply side pressures, the brokerage highlighted. Jefferies forecasts about 70 basis points (bps) decline in IT firms margins in FY23 and expect Top-5 Indian IT firms to deliver 7-15% EPS CAGR over FY22-24.

Updated: 15 Mar 2022,Indian IT firms may have to offer higher pay hikes onsite,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/indian-it-firms-may-have-to-offer-higher-salary-hikes-onsite-jefferies-suggests-these-3-it-stocks-to-buy-11647327131768.html,"Indian IT firms are likely to face margin headwinds from higher onsite wage hikes and rising travel costs which may partly be offset by replacement of subcontractors, as per global brokerage Jefferies. On a net basis, it estimates a 70-130 bps margin impact due to these factors for Top 5 IT firms. “Over the past six months, US inflation rate has moved up sharply to 7%+ levels. In the past, onsite wage inflation for Indian IT firms ranged between 1.5-2% - in line with local inflation levels. If the current spike in inflation levels in the US sustains, then Indian IT firms may have to offer higher wage hikes onsite,"" the note added. Jefferies' analysis suggests that every 1% higher onsite wage inflation could lead to a 30 bps margin drag.  With rising acceptance of remote work/offshoring, while travel costs may not rise to pre-Covid levels, even if they increase to an average level of pre-Covid and Covid periods, they could also hit margins by 40-100 basis points (bps). Further, higher onsite mix may impact margins, however the IT firms' ongoing pyramid rationalization and potential utilization tweaks could more than offset this hit, the global brokerage highlighted. While rupee depreciation will partly offset this impact, Jefferies has lowered its FY23/24 EPS estimates by up to 3% to factor this. Infosys and Tech Mahindra remain Jefferies' top stock picks in the IT sector, given their strong growth outlook.

Updated: 15 Mar 2022,Over 10% of our new hires to come in from tier-2 cities: C.P. Gurnani,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/over-10-of-our-new-hires-to-come-in-from-tier-2-cities-c-p-gurnani-11647277067083.html,"BENGALURU : Pune-based IT services major Tech Mahindra Ltd is betting big on the opportunities provided by 5G and digital transformation. It has recently also forayed into the metaverse space with the launch of TechMVerse, to offer interactive and immersive experiences to customers. It plans to hire and train about 1,000 people dedicated for the TechMVerse in the first year and initially, the operations will be spread across four hubs – Dallas, London, Pune, and Hyderabad. Tech Mahindra’s entry into the metaverse is expected to be an extension of its NXT.NOW framework, which aims to enhance human-centric experiences by investing in emerging technologies and solutions that enable digital transformation to meet the evolving needs of the customer. As it builds a digital-ready talent pool to power its new initiatives, it is expanding into various tier-2 cities to find and attract the best of talent. In an interview, C.P. Gurnani, MD and CEO, Tech Mahindra talks about what’s driving the demand, its foray into the metaverse, and hiring strategy. Edited excerpts: How is the overall demand environment, and what are clients spending on? It is very clear that 5G and digital transformation are driving demand. And clearly, the legacy stacks are moving towards the cloud. When it comes to engineering, there is a demand for electric vehicles. The third demand driver is cybersecurity, and the fourth driver is sustainability. So, in general, I would say that 5G, experience design, and ‘phygital’ (a combination of physical and digital) are driving consumption. What are your hiring plans for the next fiscal, including your strategy to hire from tier-2 cities? We don’t share hiring forecast numbers, but we have opened up a lot of new centres in tier-2 and tier-3 cities. For example, we have opened up international centres in places like Latvia, Romania, and Costa Rica. We expect over 10% of our new hires to come in from tier-2 cities. It is helping us attract talent. We believe that the level of skills is extremely good, and the attrition rates are much lower. We are decisive about expanding our global reach through tier-2 cities. In India, for example, very good talent is available in places like Bhubaneshwar, Chandigarh, Kolkata, Indore, Vijayawada, and Coimbatore. Tech Mahindra has launched its metaverse offering. How do you intend to take it to your clients? A key focus area is helping our customers’ digital journey, and technology is helping us build the differentiators. Metaverse is clearly a key differentiator. Like any other new technology, our metaverse offering will be initially incubated in a smaller group and then shared with our clients because it is also a new way of running their business for most of them. By definition, you are now saying that you have redefined the universe to become a meta-universe. We believe initially, our metaverse offerings, including DealerVerse, metaverse-based car dealership; Middlemist, our NFT marketplace; or Meta Bank, a virtual bank, will be run as a separate unit. But eventually, it will work together with various verticals. Who are the early adopters of metaverse? The first is the gaming sector that comes under our media and entertainment vertical. The second is healthcare and then retail. I don’t think we have seen much adoption in the manufacturing sector immediately. But we have clearly seen it in banking. We are also seeing it in dealer management and on the NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace. You have made eight acquisitions in FY22. What’s your acquisition strategy? From a strategy point of view, our mergers and acquisitions have been driven by capability building, portfolio de-risking, and geographic expansion. I am not trying to say that I want to be effective in all markets, but I want to take advantage of my clients requiring a presence there. Some of the recent acquisitions include Com tec Co IT, Infostar LLC, We Make Websites, DigitalOnUS, and Activus Connect. What could be the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on Tech Mahindra and the IT sector? If you look at it from a purely mathematical point of view, there is no direct impact because the Indian IT sector is not really dependent on either of the two countries. I am sure there will be an overall impact on the global economy. There could also be an advantage because some of the companies dependent on the talent in Russia and Ukraine may want to de-risk and come to India. But we consider this to be a very unfortunate event. We do not have employees or offices in Ukraine and Russia, but we feel bad. We are not a firm that wants to look at the opportunity because of war unless a client comes to us and asks for help."
