Kamath said historically geopolitical tensions have helped the US economy. He then asked what will happen to the economy amidst the current tension between Russia-Ukraine.   Data uploaded by Kamath on his Twitter account showed that among G20 countries, the US holds a 33% share of the global equity market cap followed by China which holds 10.97%, European Union holds 6.24%, while Japan held 5.20%, and Saudi Arabia holding 3.12%. These five countries account for a 58.53% share of the global equity market cap. India is at the sixth spot - accounting for 3.11% of the global market equity cap followed by Canada accounting for 3.03%, while France and the UK hold 2.82% each. Further, among G20 nations, China and India hold a major share of the global population at about 17.67% and 17.12% respectively. The US accounts for 4.16% of the global population, European Union holds 5.59%, and Japan accounting a 1.57% share of the global population. Kamath said, “All said and done; the US is still by far the biggest game around. Historically geopolitical tensions have helped the US economy."" adding ""what'll happen this time around?."" According to a Bloomberg report, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans a candid discussion about the war in Ukraine with his Chinese counterpart during an upcoming summit in Bali. A top Biden administration official earlier urged Beijing to stop spreading Russian “lies"" about the Kremlin’s invasion of its neighbor. Further, the report said, Blinken does not plan to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during the Group of 20 ministerial gathering in Bali this week. President Joe Biden has called for Russia to be removed from the G20 over the invasion and diplomats have previously walked out of a Lavrov speech in protest of the Kremlin’s war. Global markets have taken a massive hit since February last week when Kremlin carried out an all-out invasion of Ukraine. Since then, crude oil prices have spiked to multi-year high along with other commodity prices escalating inflation pressures that led to monetary policy tightening. The pandemic and supply chain disruption has further added to the global economy's woes. Concerns of a possible recession ahead have fuelled fears among investors that have pushed markets into a deep bearish tone since May. The uncertainty around the Russia - Ukraine conflict continues. G20 is a strategic multilateral platform connecting the world’s major developed and emerging economies. Notably, G20 members represent more than 80% of world GDP, 75% of international trade, and 60% of the world population. G20 countries are - Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union."

However, international traders will stop purchases of oil from Rosneft after May 15 as EU sanctions over several Russian companies come into effect. Last December IOC and Rosneft signed a term contract for supply of up to 2 million tonnes of Urals oil until the end of 2022.   World food prices eased slightly in April after hitting a record high in March, but global food security remained a concern because of the difficult market conditions, U.N. food agency said on Friday. The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 158.5 points last month versus an upwardly revised 159.7 for March. The March figure was previously put at 159.3.   Angel One expanded its client base to 9.64 million in April, a 118.1% YoY growth. The company’s gross client acquisition for the month stood at 0.44 million, a 41.5% YoY increase. The 66.14 million orders, a 65.7% YoY rise, in April 2022 indicates the high level of client activity on the company’s platform.   Macro Factors & Earnings Continue to Weigh On Market Sentiments: April has exhibited a rather mixed performance across all sectoral, market cap, and style indices, which indicate some change in the underlying market regime. Though some recovery was seen in the equity market after a major selloff on 24th February, the trend is likely to be range-bound moving forward.  During the month, Commodities, Energy, Auto and FMCG indices performed well while IT and Media indices reported a significant decline. While Small Caps suffered the most, they also recovered from the 24th Feb’22 bottom rather swiftly. Nifty 50 has recovered 5% since the 24th Feb’22 sell-off. On a positive note, the broader market witnessed a much faster recovery over the same period with Mid and Small Caps recovering by 11% and 13% respectively.  The prevailing geopolitical developments are likely to continue being at the centre stage for some more time before it concludes in a more concrete direction. The market will also continue to eye on rising Covid-19 cases and the impact of lockdown in China. Consequently, its performance is likely to be range-bound in the near term. We believe most of the CY22 returns are expected to be back-loaded and H2CY22 is likely to be less volatile than H1CY22. Keeping these developments in perspective, we value it at 22x FY24E earnings and maintain our Dec’22 NIFTY50 target of 20200 unchanged.

It later filed a challenge against the Indian financial crime fighting agency's decision in the High Court of the southern Karnataka state.   Standing firm – reiterate as preferred bet among two wheelers TVSL 4QFY22 were largely in-line to our/street estimates. EBITDA margins over last few quarters (ex of 1Q) have been strong at >10% despite multiple headwinds. With volume recovery over low base, we expect margins to expand by 80bp/30bp at 10.2%/10.5% for FY23E/24E. TVSL currently trades at 23x/19x of FY23/24 EPS (v/s HMCL at ~15x/12.9x and BJAUT of 17x/14.5x). We believe it should continue to trade at a premium as we expect EPS CAGR of ~31% over FY22-24E. EV focus continues to intensify with more capex/investments towards the same. We believe sustained market share gains in domestic EV 2Ws led by aggressive product pipeline, scope of external investments in to EV vertical and NBFC TVS credit are additional re-rating triggers. We re-iterate TVS as our preferred pick among 2W names with BUY and TP of Rs779 (v/s Rs789) with FY23/24 estimates tweaked marginally.   The volatility was clearly on the higher side and the way we concluded the weekly expiry, certainly does not bode well for the bulls. But we reiterate, that we would avoid getting carried away by this; because we believe markets are a bit oversold and the last two days’ move could be a deceptive one. Hence, rather than jumping into this, we would stay on the sidelines and would assess the situation for the next 2 – to 3 days.  As far as levels are concerned, 16600-16500 are to be treated as immediate supports, while 16900-17000 has now become a sturdy wall.    Indian equity markets fell over 1% on Friday, tracking a decline in Asian peers as U.S. stocks fell sharply overnight on worries the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike this week may not be enough to help fight surging inflation.

Strong Growth and market share gains in core business in tough environment Aggressive towards expansion/innovation via ecommerce We are maintaining our EPS estimate of 11.5/13.8 for FY23/24 on expectations of strong growth in drinks, beverages and foods, IBD & increasing share of e-commerce innovations. We expect near-term growth pressures given input cost inflation, slowdown in rural demand & overall decline in discretionary consumption. However, we remain positive on long term outlook given 1) Innovation led growth strategy, 2) Increasing share in foods & beverages category 3) LUP Innovations allowing DABUR to leverage its distribution 4) Cost saving initiatives and 6) Strong rural distribution coverage of 90k villages (30k added in FY22) 7) 4-5% incremental sales every year from ecommerce innovations. Dabur remains a formidable play on recovery in rural demand in coming quarters. Dabur trades at 38.2x FY24 EPS with 16% EPS CAGR over FY22-24 and 24% ROE and 50% dividend payout. Retain accumulate with 12 month DCF based target price of Rs603 (unchanged).

Updated: 02 Mar 2022,Super 15: Stocks benefitting from rising popularity of ESG theme ,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/super-15-stock-benefitting-from-rising-popularity-of-esg-theme-11646195130371.html,"In a post-Covid world, conscious investing has gained lot of traction among investors. In fact, in 2021, at a global platform, India made a commitment to reach net carbon zero by 2070. With the environment, social and governance (ESG) theme fast catching-up, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd have outlined key considerations for investors and picked stocks from five sectors to bet on this theme. They are as follows: 1) Coal Sector: The fundamental question for India's transition is linked to its coal sector. Ensuring a well-planned and just transition away from coal will be a significant challenge, with both risks and opportunities in the power sector and beyond. With around 8% of state revenue from coal activities, diversification of the economy is needed. Coal India Ltd will be central to the transition. The company has already taken steps to diversify into renewable power, with three gigawatts of planned solar capacity to FY24. Natural gas is also set to play a significant role in displacing coal. GAIL India Ltd operates around 220 mmsmd (million metric standard cubic meter per day) of pipeline capacity and is the largest LNG trader in India. 2) Agriculture accounts for around 20% of India's greenhouse gas emissions and is the main source of non-carbon dioxide related emissions. Opportunities exist for investors through chemical free farming and low-cost solutions which improve irrigation and energy efficiency. UPL Ltd will likely play a central role in decarbonisation efforts. Through various projects, it is driving the adoption of digital solutions and increased penetration of bio-solutions. 3) Road Transport: With auto demand set to grow to 2040, an uptake in electric power-trains is an important area of focus for policy-makers. Tata Motors Ltd leads the local market with nearly 7% market share. Bajaj Auto Ltd, TVS Motor Company Ltd & Hero MotoCorp Ltd are actively expanding their electric vehicles portfolios. 4) Power Utilities: State-run distribution companies will underpin India's energy transition. Their financial fragility however currently inhibits their appetite for investment and transformation of the power grid. NTPC Ltd should be a key beneficiary of new renewable capacity given its access to low cost funding. Power Grid Corporation of India, Larsen & Toubro Ltd, Siemens Ltd and KEI International Ltd could all see tailwinds from increased transmission and distribution spend. 5) Heavy Industry: Heavy industry's share of energy consumption has increased to 42%, making it the largest end user of energy. Incumbents are focused on renewable power with Shree Cement Ltd, The Ramco Cements Ltd and Ultratech Cement Ltd all active in this regard."
