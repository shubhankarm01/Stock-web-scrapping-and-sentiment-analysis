Bajaj Finance and its parent Bajaj Finserv were the biggest contributors to Sensex today. The investors' optimism in Bajaj shares come after Bajaj Finance announced its provisional data for the first quarter of FY23 ahead of its result. The stock skyrocketed as the company made strong growth in terms of new loans and customer franchises, meanwhile, also continued to maintain a robust liquidity position. Both Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Finance were top gainers of Sensex with an upside of more than 4.5% each, followed by other heavyweights like HUL, Maruti Suzuki, Asian Paint, and Titan. Bajaj Finance's strong performance in the Q1FY23 sparked a bullish sentiment in its parent Bajaj Finserv as well during the day. On BSE, Bajaj Finance shares closed at ₹5,917.60 apiece up by ₹255.55 or 4.51%. The shares had touched an intraday high of ₹5,932.95 apiece during the trading hours. Due to its strong upside on BSE, Bajaj Finance outran ITC in becoming the 11th most valued company. Currently, Bajaj Finance's market cap is around ₹3,58,268.80 crore compared to ITC's market valuation of ₹3,56,388.56 crore. Up till June 5, ITC held the 11th most valued company title on BSE. However, that has changed with Bajaj Finance taking the 11th position as of now. As of June 30, 2022, Bajaj Finance's customer franchise surged to 60.3 million as compared to 50.5 million as of 30 June 2021.

Updated: 06 Jul 2022,ITC shares hit a new 52-week high. Should you invest?,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/the-awakening-of-giant-itc-hits-a-new-52-week-high-should-you-invest-11657029644421.html,"FMCG major, ITC extended its 52-week high on Tuesday on BSE before correcting in the closing hours of trading. ITC has also broken the record and turned into a Nifty topper. Not just that, ITC stock has reached 3-year high on stock exchanges. ITC has made some strong gains in a volatile market scenario that was a spillover of macroeconomic risks. But the potential of ITC has only begun and it is seen as a classic value stock to hold going forward. On BSE, ITC shares hit a new 52-week high of ₹293.45 apiece earlier today. However, the stock corrected and closed in red at ₹286.75 apiece down by 1.73% on the exchange. At the closing price, ITC's market cap stands at ₹3,53,369.36 crore. Compared to its fresh 52-week high, ITC stock has gained by a whopping over 44% in a year. Meanwhile, its growth is nearly 34% so far in 2022. In comparison to the closing price on BSE, ITC stock has jumped nearly 41% in a year, and nearly 31% so far this year. ITC is nearing the top 10 most valued companies club. It currently holds the 11th most valued firm rank on BSE and is following Bharti Airtel who is the tenth most valued firm with a market cap of ₹3,75,819.43 crore and HDFC at ninth rank with a valuation of ₹3,99,627.10 crore. Talking about ITC's stock performance, Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said, ""Globally now there is a trend in favour of value stocks. ITC, a classic value stock, has been underperforming due to ESG concerns, particularly since tobacco contributes the bulk of ITC's bottom line. This underperformance which had no fundamental basis is being corrected now."" Last month, analysts at Ventura Securities in its research note said, although ITC Ltd. has been a stark underperformer over the last few years, we believe that this is set to change. Having achieved critical scale, the FMCG business which has been dragging profitability is expected to witness robust growth (16% CAGR to ₹22,729 cr) with improving margins (+290 bps to 8.6%). Increasing migration towards sustainable packaging and revenge travel post-pandemic should help bolster revenue growth and profitability of both verticals. With buoyancy in tax collections, the stress on rising cigarette taxation is diminished and should help drive cigarette volume growth. The agri-commodity business prospects have sharply improved post the Ukraine invasion and the IT vertical is expected to continue its strong double-digit revenue growth with top percentile margins. Further, Ventura's note said that among Nifty 50 stocks, ITC is one of the few stocks that provide a strong growth opportunity along with an attractive dividend yield of 4.19%. The market has not taken cognizance of the fact that ITC’s FY24 EBIT of ₹24,613.5 cr is expected to be more than 1.6X that of HUL (which is the 2nd most profitable listed consumer player) and equal to the combined EBIT of the next 4 players. It added, ""We believe that this dominance should result in the rerating of the stock as the growth story unfolds. Another kicker for the valuation rerating is the potential demerger plan as outlined in the Dec-21 corporate communication."" Ventura has kept a buy rating on ITC with a target price of ₹350 apiece ahead. In its annual report of FY22, ITC Chairman & Managing Director, Sanjiv Puri said, with enhanced scale and margin expansion, the FMCG Businesses are expected to make increasingly higher contributions to the Company’s profit pool, thereby setting the stage for further value enhancement opportunities. On the cigarettes business, Puri said, ""as seen in the past, stability in taxes on cigarettes enables the legal cigarette industry to claw back volumes lost to illicit trade, thereby engendering domestic demand for Indian tobaccos, while also mitigating loss of tax revenue to the Exchequer due to illicit trade."" He added, ""Stability in taxes is critical for addressing the interests of all the stakeholders of this industry, including the tobacco farmers, the Exchequer, and the consumers."" While respite from a further increase in taxes has provided the legal cigarette industry an opportunity to claw back volumes lost to illicit trade, the operating environment remains challenging due to elevated levels of taxation, a high share of illicit trade, and disproportionate regulatory pressures, Puri had said. In FY22, ITC's overall gross revenue at ₹59,101.09 crore increased by 22.7%, while EBITDA increased by 22.0% to ₹18,933.66 crore. Profit After Tax stood at ₹15,057.83 crore (previous year ₹13,031.68 crore). Total Comprehensive Income for the year stood at ₹15,631.68 crore (previous year ₹13,277.93 crore). Earnings Per Share for the year stood at ₹12.22 (the previous year ₹10.59)."
Updated: 05 Jul 2022,Indices erase all gains to end in red; Sensex falls over 700 pts from day's high,https://www.livemint.com/market/live-blog/share-market-live-updates-sensex-nifty-bse-nse-stock-market-today-05-07-2022-hdfc-bank-hdfc-11656985662464.html,"Nifty and Sensex jumped over 1% around mid-session trade on Tuesday but turned negative later in the day amid weakness in global markets as concern over the possibility of a recession outweighed optimism over US-China talks aimed at tariff reductions. Markets will take cues from US Fed minutes of meeting on Wednesday and the June quarter earnings season going forward.  Benchmark indices erased all gains made in the first half of trade on Tuesday as US futures and European markets fell. Sensex slipped 732 points from intra-day high to close 100 points lower at 53,134 . Nifty failed to hold the 16,000 level, ending 215 points from highs to end 25 points lower at 15,811. Infosys, ITC and HDFC were the biggest contributors to the fall on Sensex. ITC, Wipro, HDFC Life, Britannia Industries and Maruti Suzuki were among the laggards on Nifty. Barring Nifty Metal and Pharma, all sectoral indices ended in the red. The BSE midcap index fell 0.4%, while BSE Smallcap index rose 0.2%. The Indian rupee plunged 41 paise to a record low of 79.36 against US dollar.   Inflation-targeted monetary and liquidity tightening, along with hardening rates, generally comes bundled with a system-level GDP/credit growth sacrifice. For banks, it also seems reasonable to expect a rise in borrower segment-specific risk aversion. As we state in our sector initiation Shaken, not stirred, the signature impact of rising rates is not the small boost to margins, but the acceleration of prime credit market share gain for high-CASA large private banks. We do not foresee major asset-quality incidents and adequate provisioning/capitalisation raises insulation. Too soon for a rate hike impact, too late for Covid surprises However, (i) slowing credit growth, (ii) small boost in margins and (iii) mix shift toward prime credit are unlikely to manifest in 1QFY23 results, we think. Even in an accelerated timeline, the earliest print impact should not predate 2QFY23. On the other hand, Covid-driven “irregular"" assets have settled in “restructured"" or “GNPA"" buckets with a clear line of sight on provisioning and credit costs. Problems are known and their quantum more or less crystallised. We expect 21% NII growth, 17% PPoP growth and 49% PAT growth y-y in our coverage aggregate. Commentary key to finer nuances of sector strategy This is the first quarter during which banks will discuss inflation and material interest rate hikes as baseline expectations, not possibilities. They will have even more clarity on their provisioning trajectory for restructured and other “irregular"" assets and lay out their segment preferences and pricing strategy in relation to the evolving macro situation. For us, this holds the key to gauging their earnings trajectory over the next 12-15 months and should set the yardstick against which performance will likely be evaluated by the stock market. Early disclosures offer no major surprises Of the banks under our coverage that have made early disclosures on 1QFY23 fundamentals – HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank and AU Small Finance Bank – none have delivered surprises that necessitate re-evaluation of our sector stance. AU and IndusInd have shown a strong set of numbers that are marginally ahead of expectations, while HDFCB has disappointed a bit on CASA (2.2% y-y decline), but with a higher-than-expected (5% y-y) retail loan growth as a silver lining.   Britannia Industries' shareholders have voted against a resolution to authorise the board to make investments, give loans and provide guarantees of up to ₹5,000 crore in the AGM concluded last week. The special resolution for approval to increase limits for making investments, loans, Special guarantees and security was ""not Passed with requisite majority,"" said a regulatory filing from Britannia Industries on June 29, 2022.   US index futures and European equities fell as concern over the possibility of a recession outweighed optimism over US-China talks aimed at tariff reductions. The euro slipped to a 20-year low. The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.5% while futures on the S&P 500 lost 0.6%   The windfall taxes on domestic crude oil production and fuel exports will generate close to $12 billion ( ₹94,800 crore) for the government in the remainder of the current fiscal while trimming profits of firms such as Reliance Industries Ltd and ONGC, Moody's Investors Service said Tuesday. On July 1, the government imposed windfall gain taxes on the export of petrol, diesel and aviation turbine fuel (ATF), and on the domestic production of crude oil. It has also mandated exporters to meet the requirements of the domestic market first.   The issue will open on July 5 and close on July 26 with an option of early closure, the company said in a statement. The public issue of secured redeemable non-convertible debentures (NCDs) or bonds will have a face value of ₹1,000 each. The issue has a base issue size of ₹150 crore with an option to retain an oversubscription of up to ₹150 crore, aggregating to ₹300 crore.   Global shares rose on Tuesday as positive economic data and hints of easing Sino-U.S. tensions offered some respite after recent sell-offs, though fears of a global recession and sky-high inflation tempered the mood. Tokyo - Nikkei 225 closed 1% higher; Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: rose 0.5%; Shanghai - Composite ended flat. London - FTSE 100 was up 0.3 %.   India has expanded the excise duty exemption for biofuels to encourage the blending of higher proportions of ethanol and components of vegetable oil with gasoline and diesel, a government order said. The tax exemption will be applicable to an ethanol portion of 12%-15% blended with gasoline, up from 10% previously. For diesel, the exemption will apply to a 20% portion of alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids obtained from vegetable oils, the order said. (Reuters)   Automobile retail registration data reported by FADA indicates total vehicle retail for Jun’22 increased by 27% YoY with growth across categories i.e. 2W, 3W, PV, Tractors and CV were. However, compared with Pre-Covid level of Jun’19, total vehicle retail was down by -9% with sharper decline in 2W and 3W which de-grew by 16% and 6% respectively. Though few categories are consistently showing recovery, full recovery is yet to be witnessed when compared to pre-covid times. Increased wholesale reflects ease in semi-conductor availability thus reducing supply side constraints going ahead. We expect strong bounce back in 2HFY23 with rural recovery post favourable monsoon and further ease on semiconductor availability. We expect YoY volume growth across categories in FY23E with M&HCVs and 3Ws expected to record 30%+ growth.   Passenger vehicle retail sales in the country rose 40 per cent in June indicating an improvement in semiconductor supplies even as demand, especially for SUVs, remained robust, auto dealer' body FADA said on Tuesday. According to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), passenger vehicle (PV) registrations rose to 2,60,683 units last month, as compared to 1,85,998 units in June 2021.   Warnings from Indian crypto exchanges that a controversial new transaction tax would erode trading are coming true, with volumes evaporating since the levy took effect.

In Asia, nearly 7 in 10 companies are confident about their cyber resilience despite rapid digital transformation, rising number of cyberattacks, and increasing modes of cyber threats. However, nearly half (48%) admit that there is still room for improvement when it comes to cyber hygiene measures essential to managing cyber risks. This is according to the Asia Insights of The State of Cyber Resilience, published Tuesday by Marsh, the world’s leading insurance broker and risk advisor, and Microsoft Corp., a leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world.   Shares of Marksans Pharma rallied more than 17% to ₹50 apiece on the BSE in Tuesday's trading session after the company informed its plans to consider the issue of bonus shares. Bonus shares are fully paid additional shares issued by a company to its existing shareholders.   Oil held gains as investors assessed still-strong underlying market signals against concerns a recession will eventually sap demand. West Texas Intermediate traded above $110 a barrel in Asia after a long holiday weekend in the US. The benchmark is more than 1% higher than Friday’s close as there was no settlement on Monday. Key market timespreads remain robust, indicating that there’s solid demand for near-term supplies.   The carmaker expects second half of the current fiscalto be better in terms of performance with gradual improvement in the overall supply situation and stabilisation in commodity prices, according to company chairman N Chandrasekaran.   Gold rates in India continued their recent uptrend with futures on MCX hitting over two-month high of ₹52261 per 10 gram, up 0.2% from previous close. Silver futures rose 0.5% to ₹58,780. Despite inflation and growth worries, gold has been under pressure in the past few months amid rate hikes by central banks to tame runaway inflation.   India's dominant services industry expanded at the fastest pace in over eleven years in June amid strong demand but stubborn inflation remains a concern as prices charged rose at the sharpest rate in almost five years, a private survey showed no Tuesday. The S&P Global India Services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 59.2 in June from 58.9 in May, its highest since April 2011 and above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. A Reuters poll had predicted a dip to 58.7.   Nifty has shown a strong follow-up buying post the favorable previous trading session that could be seen as an encouraging sign for the bulls of D-street. On technical parameters, the 15700-sub zone has once again proved its mettle, and till the time index manages to sustain above the same, any minor correction could be seen as a buying opportunity in the near term. On the contrary, the 15950-16000 zone is likely to act as a sturdy wall, and only a breakthrough could ascertain the bullish momentum to continue in the coming sessions. The market has seen some strong traction by the fag end favoring the bulls. However, the global market could act as a catalyst in either propelling the bullish sentiments or putting a halt to the same. Hence, keeping a tab on the developments across the global bourses is advisable. Meanwhile, our index is likely to stay within the mentioned range until any decisive breakthrough on either of the sides is not seen. Hence considering the recent price action, we advocate utilizing any dip towards the support zone and continuing with a stock-specific approach for better trading opportunities.   India’s trade deficit widened to a record in June, adding further pressure on the Indian currency, which has hit new lows against the dollar in the past weeks. Merchandise exports growth slowed for the third straight month in June to touch a four-month low of $37.94 billion, while imports surged by 51% to a record $63.58 billion from a year earlier      Tata Steel Long Products up 3% as company has completed the acquisition of state-owned Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd for ₹12,100 crore, the Centre said. The strategic divestment of the Odisha-based steelmaker was underway since January 2021.   - Room AC segment saw strong rebound, DC refrigerator demand remains weak. -Voltas is yet to recover lost ground, Lloyd maintained strong growth momentum - High inventory levels with commodity prices correction; Weak rural demand. Demand softness witnessed towards end of the quarter, due to commodity price correction (~10-15% in June month) and offset of summer season. Overall companies have been reluctant in taking price hikes. Although commodity cost correction has begun, our channel check indicate that further price hike will be inevitable going forward. Rural demand remains weak. We expect our consumer durables universe to register sales growth of 70% YoY (low base due to COVID 2nd wave). With sustained RM inflation, inability to increase prices due to weak demand and return of some discretionary costs, we expect margins to remain under pressure (+10bps QoQ) for our coverage universe. We expect EBITDA/PAT growth of 98%/ 103% YoY (low base due to COVID 2nd wave) across our coverage universe. Although we remain structurally positive on long term prospects, we see demand headwinds due to high inflation in near term We maintain our positive stance on Consumer Durables because of low penetration and market consolidation. Butterfly acquisition will further strengthen its positioning in kitchen appliance market. We rate CROMPTON as our top pick. We believe Voltas’s re-rating depends upon market share rebound in room AC segment which we expect to happen by year end. Havells’s is benefitting from Lloyd’s ramp-up but profitability is yet to improve which would further re-rate the stock. Weak rural demand is not favorable for Bajaj Electrical in near term. KEI/Polycab wil continue to benefit from industrial uptick.   U.S. equities were closed on Monday for Independence Day holiday. Recession fears are likely to dominate the markets going forward.

Updated: 04 Jul 2022,ITC shares' rally continues as stock surges to 3-year high,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/itc-shares-rally-continues-as-stock-surges-to-3-year-high-11656912143960.html,"Shares of ITC Ltd continued the uptrend with the stock rising to a 3-year high in Monday's early session as it was up over 2% to ₹290 apiece on the BSE, its highest since 2019. From being a dull performer in the past few years, the stock has outperformed in 2022 (YTD) so far as it has rallied more than 32% during the period as compared to about 11% fall in benchmark Sensex. ITC has a diversified presence across industries such as FMCG, hotels, packaging, paperboards, specialty papers and agribusiness. The FMCG major posted 12% growth in net profit to ₹4,195 crore for the January-March period, compared with ₹3,755 crore a year ago. The Kolkata-based company's revenue from operations rose 15% to ₹17,754 crore as against ₹15,404 crore in the last year period. Its FMCG revenue grew 12.3% during the quarter to ₹4,141.9 crore, while cigarette revenue rose 10% to ₹6,443. The hotels business reported segment revenue of ₹389.6 crore during the quarter, up 35.3% from a year earlier. In a report in mid-June brokerage Motilal Oswal said it has upgraded ITC shares rating to buy as demand was quick to recover to pre-pandemic levels after the second covid wave and Motilal Oswal's channel checks suggested that demand remains robust. “A better than expected demand recovery and a healthy margin outlook in Cigarettes, healthy sales momentum in the FMCG business, lower drag from the Hotels business, and better capital allocation in recent years leads Motilal Oswal to turn constructive on the ITC stock,"" it said said in the note. A stable tax environment for cigarettes in recent years has allowed ITC to calibrate price increases to avoid a disruption in demand, as analysts expect this trend to continue and should result in improved Cigarette volumes and earnings visibility over the medium-term. Further, the resilient nature of its core business, amid an uncertain environment in the sector, and 4-5% dividend yield makes it a good defensive bet in the ongoing volatile interest rate environment."

While each of these routes differs from the other in terms of minimum investment, lock-in and liquidity of funds invested, and management fees charged, they also differ in the tax treatment of the income earned through them. Often, the tax advantage of a particular route may impact the investor’s post-tax yield.

However, fag-end buying in ITC, Bajaj twins, and HDFC helped the indices trim some of the decline. The Indian rupee rose 6 paise to close at 79.00 (provisional) against US dollar. European shares edged higher after Asian benchmarks finished lower on Friday, as a quarterly report by Japan’s central bank rekindled worries about the world’s third largest economy. Shares fell in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Shanghai.  Indian indices on Friday started the fresh month of July on a negative note amid continuing volatility in global markets. The Sensex lost 111.01 points, or 0.21%, to close at 52,907.93, while Nifty50 declined 28.20 points to end at 15,752.05. Sectorally, oil & gas and energy stocks tumbled, while FMCG and realty advanced. On the 30-stock index, ITC, Bajaj twins, Asian Paints, and HUL were the top performers, while Reliance Industries, PowerGrid, and Bharti Airtel were among the biggest losers. On the Nifty50 index, ITC, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Cipla, and BPCL registered the biggest gains, while ONGC, Reliance, and PowerGrid were the biggest laggards.   Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said the government will review every fortnight the new taxes levied on crude, diesel and ATF based on international prices. She said these are ""extraordinary times"" and oil prices are internationally unbridled. ""We do not want to discourage export, but want domestic availability to increase,"" Sitharaman told reporters here. She said that if oil is not being available and exports are happening at such phenomenal profit, we need at least some of it for our own citizens. ""We need to take this twin-pronged approach,"" the minister added. The government on Friday slapped an export tax on petrol, diesel and jet fuel (ATF) while also joining nations like the UK in imposing a windfall tax on crude oil produced locally.   The risk of a renewed selloff in equity markets is still high as investors are only pricing a mild recession, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists. “Much of the valuation de-rating this year has been due to higher rates/inflation,"" strategists led by Christian Mueller-Glissmann wrote in a note dated June 30. “Unless bond yields start to decline and buffer rising equity risk premiums due to recession fears, equity valuations could decline further."" Stock markets globally have just experienced one of their worst six months on record as stubbornly high inflation and hawkish central banks raised the specter of a sharp economic slowdown. The US S&P 500 Index had its worst first-half performance since 1970, losing over $8 trillion in market capitalization.   The second half of the year started with another first class drubbing for global stock markets on Friday, as the recession concerns that have built in recent weeks also shoved oil and metals lower again. MSCI's world stocks index has had its worst start to a year since its 1990 creation over the last six months and a 1% early tumble in Europe and for Wall Street futures pointed to more pain ahead. Asia had thudded lower too with the heaviest fall in Taiwan, where the growth-sensitive benchmark index slid more than 3% to its lowest since late 2020. Japan's Nikkei fell 1.75%. The Australian and New Zealand dollars each fell 1% to two-year lows. Growth-sensitive copper was down 2.7% and heading for its forth straight weekly drop, while U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds rallied in the bond markets.   The Indian rupee plunged on Friday to mark the fourth straight session of record lows, breaking below the 79-per-dollar mark, weighed down by broad strength in the greenback and as investors retreated from the domestic share markets. The U.S. dollar remained strong against major peers due to the prospects of aggressive U.S. interest rates and fears of a widespread recession. [USD/] As of 0820 GMT, the partially convertible rupee was trading at 79.10/11 per dollar, after touching a record low of 79.1150. The unit had ended at 78.9675 on Thursday. ""The rupee-dollar exchange rate will remain volatile with a depreciation bias in near term due to a widening trade deficit, foreign portfolio investment outflows and strengthening of the U.S. dollar index,"" economists at rating agency CRISIL wrote in a note on Friday. ""We expect the exchange rate to settle at 78/$ by March 2023, compared with 76.2/$ in March 2022,"" the economists added. Traders said there was sporadic dollar-selling intervention seen in the market, but the depreciation pressure on the rupee was large.   The country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) on Friday reported a 5.7% increase in total wholesales at 1,55,857 units in June. The automaker had dispatched 1,47,368 units to dealers in June 2021, the company said in a statement.   Hero MotoCorp has announced that it will increase the prices of its motorcycles and scooter from today, July 1, 2022. The company, it its regulatory filing on June 23, notified that it will raise the prices of its motorcycles and scooter by up to ₹3,000 across the entire range from 1 July, 2022 onwards.   The value of the Indian rupee with respect to the US dollar has fallen significantly in 2022. The primary reason for this has been the strength of the US dollar.   Fears of aggressive quantitative tightening by the US Federal Reserve to tame inflation has triggered selling of Indian stocks by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). In fact, the current spree FPI selling in Indian equities is turning out to be the highest ever since the global financial crisis of 2008, as per an analysis by ICICI Securities Ltd.   To ease the domestic fuel supply crunch the government has decided to slap an export tax on petrol, diesel and jet fuel (ATF) shipped overseas by firms like Reliance Industries. It has also imposed a windfall tax on crude oil produced locally by companies such as ONGC and Vedanta.   The government has announced taxes on windfall gains made by crude oil producers. The government slapped a ₹23,230 per tonne additional tax on domestically produced crude oil to take away windfall gains accruing to producers from high international oil prices.   Shares of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) plunged more than 1% to ₹73 apiece on the BSE in Friday's trading session on the record date of the bonus shares issue. The stock started trading ex-bonus from Thursday, June 30, 2022.   Investors cut holdings in exchange-traded funds for silver, platinum and palladium in the second quarter on fears that a potential recession will reduce industrial demand, but gold assets held up because of its role as a haven, and that may persist. Gold-backed ETFs shrank by just over 1% in the three months through June, or 43 tons, after an 8% surge in the first quarter helped by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. By contrast, silver holdings contracted almost 5%, and the outflow in tonnage terms was the biggest since 2011. The amount in gold ETFs is the lowest since March, while assets in the other three precious metals are around the smallest since 2020. Gold has held up well relative to silver and platinum. One ounce of gold now buys 90 ounces of silver, the most in almost two years.   Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Thursday approved Google's proposed acquisition of a minority stake in telecom major Bharti Airtel. The deal has been cleared on the basis of modifications offered by the acquirer, according to an official release. Google International LLC and Airtel have entered into an investment agreement to buy a minority and non-controlling stake of 1.28 per cent of equity share capital in the telecom player.   Drug maker Lupin on Thursday said it has received approval from the US health regulator to market Paliperidone extended-release tablets, used to treat Schizophrenia, in the American market.   Treasuries began the second half of the year on the front foot Friday as concerns continued to mount that Federal Reserve rate hikes will lead to a recession. Benchmark 10-year yields fell six basis points to 2.95% in a fourth day of declines and looked set for their biggest weekly drop in seven weeks. The move spread to other markets with Australia’s three-year yields tumbling as much as 21 basis points, just days before its central bank is expected to announce a half-point rate increase. “The focus is shifting away from inflation and is now centered on growth as fears of a recession grow, hence markets are scaling back expectations for near-term and terminal rate hikes,"" said Prashant Newnaha, a rates strategist for TD Securities. “Friday’s moves accelerated because of thin liquidity and key breaks in technical levels.""   India banned some single-use or disposable plastic products Friday as part of a federal plan to phase out the ubiquitous material in the nation of nearly 1.4 billion people. For the first stage, it has identified 19 plastic items that aren't very useful but have a high potential to become litter and makes it illegal to produce, import, stock, distribute or sell them. These items range from plastic cups and straws to ice cream sticks. Some disposable plastic bags will also be phased out and replaced with thicker ones. Thousands of other plastic products — like bottles for water or soda or bags of chips — aren't covered by the ban. But the federal government has set targets for manufacturers to be responsible for recycling or disposing of them after their use.   Oil headed for a third weekly drop, its longest losing run this year, on concern that a potential recession will cut into energy demand. West Texas Intermediate fell toward $105 a barrel after tumbling on Thursday as commodities were pummeled. The US benchmark has shed more than 2% this week despite signs that the physical crude market remains tight. India on Friday increased levies on exports of gasoline and diesel as part of a drive to control a fast-widening currency deficit. The nation has become an important destination for Russian crude this year as other nations shun flows because of the war in Ukraine. The new levies may crimp product exports. Oil fell about 8% in June as investors fretted over a potential global slowdown, eroding a rally spurred by the war in Ukraine, interruptions to supplies and rising demand. The jump in prices alarmed President Joe Biden, who’s spearheading efforts to get producers in the Middle East to boost crude output.   General Motors (GM) said on Friday it had called off the sale of a shuttered Indian plant to China's Great Wall Motor after they failed to obtain regulatory approvals, amid a tougher stance by New Delhi towards investments from Beijing. GM struck a deal in January 2020 to sell the plant to Great Wall, with the Chinese SUV-maker expected to pay up to $300 million as part of a broader plan to invest $1 billion to establish a presence in India's growing car market. The agreement, which was extended twice, expired on June 30.   Tokyo stocks ended lower Friday, following falls on Wall Street with investors spooked by a lacklustre rise in US consumer spending. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index dropped 1.73 percent, or 457.42 points, to end at 25,935.62 yen, while the broader Topix index ended down 1.38 percent, or 25.78 points, at 1,845.04.   India's factory output expanded at its slowest pace in nine months in June as elevated price pressures continued to dampen demand and output, according to a private survey, which also showed business confidence was at its lowest in over two years. Although inflation eased in May to 7.04% after touching an eight-year high of 7.79% in April, a meaningful decline is not seen anytime soon even as the Reserve Bank of India is expected to continue with aggressive rate hikes. While the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by S&P Global, remained resilient, it fell to a nine-month low of 53.9 in June from May's 54.6, lower than the Reuters poll median prediction of 54.5. It has been above the 50-level separating growth from contraction for a year, indicating growth in the sector has remained solid.   India tightened exports of oil and imports of gold in an all-out effort to rein in the rupee that plunged to a fresh record Friday. The administration raised import taxes on gold, while increasing levies on exports of gasoline and diesel as it sought to control a fast-widening currency deficit. The measures sent Reliance Industries Ltd. and other energy exporters tumbling, bringing down the benchmark index by as much as 1.7%. The currency fell again. The rupee has tested a series of record lows, underscoring the economic challenges faced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government as inflation accelerates and external finances worsen. The central bank has been battling to slow the currency’s decline, and runway rupee depreciation will worsen price pressures, and may spur more rate hikes that weigh on growth.   Global risk assets were at the epicenter of a selling spree Friday as investors kicked off the second half of the year with recession concern front and center. Stocks and equity futures from Japan to the US tumbled, extending their historic first-half rout, while every Group-of-10 currency fell against havens, the dollar and the yen. Commodities retreated while global bonds continued their late-June rally.   With an aim to provide further clarity and transparency in the disclosure of shareholding pattern to investors, Sebi on Thursday came out with a new format for disclosing shareholding pattern of the public shareholders. Also, the regulator has specified that all listed entities will have to disclose details pertaining to foreign ownership limits in the a prescribed format, according to a circular.   The government on Friday slapped a ₹6 per litre tax on exports of petrol and ATF and ₹13 per litre on exports of diesel. The government also slapped a ₹23,230 per tonne additional tax on domestically produced crude oil to take away windfall gains accruing to producers from high international oil prices, a separate government notification showed. The tax on exports follows oil refiners, particularly the private sector, reaping huge gains from exporting fuel to markets such as Europe and the US. The tax on domestically produced crude oil follows local producers reaping windfall gains from the surge in international oil prices.   Reliance Industries Ltd. slumped the most since December after the Indian government raised taxes on exports of petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. The heavyweight’s stock fell as much as 7.6%, dragging the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex lower amid broad declines in Asian equities.   Rating: BUY | CMP: Rs2,596 | TP: Rs3,277 We increase our FY23/24E earnings estimate by 23%/13% as we increase our refining margin assumptions to USD18/13/bbl (+USD6.5/1.5/bbl), while we increase our input price assumptions for petchem. Low product inventory (US diesel inventory lowest since CY08), reduced Chinese exports (May 22 diesel exports down 75% vs CY18-21 avg) and low exports from Russia have pushed Q1 diesel margins to USD42/bbl (Q4: USD18) and gasoline margins to USD 34/bbl (Q4: 16). RIL with access to discounted Russian crude (discount at over USD 30/bbl) and EU exports is best placed to capitalize on tight market conditions, given high refining complexity. We believe higher gas prices along with strong growth in telecom (continued tariff hikes) and retail (store expansion), make RIL a preferred play in challenging times. Reiterate ‘BUY’ with revised PT of Rs3,277 (Rs3,000).   State-owned Hindustan Copper on Thursday said that its board has suggested seeking shareholders' approval to raise up to ₹500 crore through debentures. The board has also recommended taking the approval of the shareholders in the ensuing annual general meeting for raising funds by issue of equity shares through Qualified Institutional Placement. ""The board of directors of Hindustan Copper Ltd ...has recommended seeking approval of the shareholders in the ensuing AGM to authorise the board... to offer, issue and allot secured or unsecured non-convertible debentures or bonds on private placement basis up to ₹500 crore,"" the state-owned company said in a filing to BSE.   State-owned Indian Bank on Thursday said it has raised the Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rates (MCLR) across tenors by 0.15 per cent with effect from Sunday. The benchmark one-year tenor MCLR -- against which most of the consumer loans are based upon -- will be 7.55 per cent as against 7.40 per cent presently, Indian Bank said in a regulatory filing. Other MCLRs ranging from overnight to 6 months tenors have been raised by similar margins in the range of 6.75 to 7.40 per cent per annum. Besides, the bank has also hiked the Treasury Bills Linked Lending Rates (TBLR), base rate and Benchmark Prime Lending Rate (BPLR).   Bitcoin dip buyers are hoping things won’t get much worse for cryptocurrencies in the remainder of this year judging by the latest surge in the virtual coin. The largest digital token rallied as much as 11.3% in Asia on Friday, briefly closing in on the $21,000 level. The climb cooled to 5% as of 1 p.m. in Tokyo, leaving Bitcoin at about $19,660. Some optimism was also evident for coins such as Ether, Solana and Avalanche, but the crypto universe was off session highs as a bout of risk aversion swept across global markets. Bitcoin has been gyrating around the $20,000 mark after a 57% slide this year. The retreat has become emblematic of depressed investor spirits as liquidity evaporates amid tightening monetary policy to fight inflation.   The rupee depreciated 5 paise to a record low of 79.11 against the US dollar in opening trade on Friday as persistent foreign funds outflows weighed on investor sentiments. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened on a weak note at 78.99 against the American dollar, then lost ground to quote at 79.11 -- its all-time low level, registering a fall of 5 paise from the last close. On Thursday, the rupee fell 3 paise to close at a fresh lifetime low of 79.06 against the US dollar. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading 0.21 per cent higher at 104.90.   India has raised its basic import duty on gold to 12.5% from 7.5%, the government said in a notification on Friday, as the world's second biggest consumer of the precious metal tries to dampen its demand. India fufills most of its gold demand through imports, which were putting pressure on the rupee which hit a record low earlier this week.   Capital markets regulator Sebi on Thursday slapped penalties totalling ₹1.6 crore on seven entities, including Kotak Mahindra Trustee Company and Managing Director of Kotak AMC Nilesh Shah, for flouting rules pertaining to mutual funds while investing in Essel Group companies.   The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Thursday imposed a penalty of ₹11 crores on Ajay Shah, National Stock Exchange, Ravi Narain, Chitra Ramakrishna and four others in a case of misuse of exchange data for commercial gains.   Asia's manufacturing activity stalled in June as many companies were hit by supply disruptions caused by China's strict COVID-19 lockdowns, while sharp economic slowdown risks in Europe and the United States reinforced fears of a global recession. A string of surveys on Friday showed China's factory activity bouncing solidly in June though a slowdown in Japan and South Korea, as well as a contraction in Taiwan, highlighted the strain from supply disruptions, rising costs and persistent material shortages. China's manufacturing activity expanded at its fastest in 13 months in June, a private survey showed, as the lifting of COVID lockdowns sent factories racing to meet solid demand. The roll-backs of China's lockdowns could ease supply chain snags, and allow automakers and other manufacturers to resume operations after suffering severe disruptions.   4 stocks to buy or sell today — 1st July   Healthvista India Ltd, (Portea), India’s largest home healthcare provider, on Thursday filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India(Sebi) for its initial public offering(IPO).   Oil headed for a third weekly drop, its longest losing run this year, on concern that a potential recession will cut into energy demand. West Texas Intermediate edged above $106 a barrel after tumbling on Thursday as commodities were pummeled. The US benchmark has shed more than 1% this week despite signs that the physical crude market remains very tight. Data this week showed weakness in US consumer spending, which is by far the biggest contributor to gross domestic product. That follows a pivot by the Federal Reserve earlier this year to aggressively tighten monetary policy to quell raging inflation. Oil fell about 8% in June as investors fretted over a potential global slowdown, eroding a rally spurred by the war in Ukraine, interruptions to supplies and rising demand. The jump in prices alarmed President Joe Biden, who’s spearheading efforts to get producers in the Middle East to boost crude output.   India's eight core industries, which include coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilizers, steel, cement and electricity, grew 18.1 per cent year-on-year in May, the government data showed. The production of cement, coal, fertilizers and electricity industries recorded high growth in May 2022 over the corresponding period of last year. Coal industries grew by 25.1 per cent and fertilizer industries were up by 22.8 per cent. While the cement industries zoomed by 26.3 per cent, whereas the electricity sector increased by 22 per cent. Coal production increased by 25.1 per cent in May, as its cumulative index increased by 26.9 per cent during April to May, 2022-23 over corresponding period of the previous year. Crude oil production increased by 4.6 per cent in May. Its cumulative index increased by 1.8 per cent during April to May over the corresponding period of previous year. Further, natural Gas production increased by 7.0 per cent in May. Its cumulative index increased by 6.7 per cent during April to May over the corresponding period of previous year. Petroleum refinery production increased by 16.7 per cent in May. Its cumulative index increased by 12.8 per cent during April to May over the corresponding period of previous year. Fertilizers, steel, cement, and electricity production increased 22.8 per cent, 15.0 per cent, 26.3 per cent, and 22.0 per cent, respectively in May.   The dollar was little changed against major peers on Friday, but was on track for its best week in four as investors weighed the boost from tighter Federal Reserve policy and the risks of a U.S. recession. The dollar index, which measures the currency against six counterparts, inched up 0.07% in Asian trading, after a 0.32% drop overnight when it was undermined by weaker-than-expected consumer spending data. For the week, it has gained 0.66% in a complex push and pull as fears of a global slowdown burnished the greenback's appeal due to its haven status. The market will be watching for weakness in U.S. ISM manufacturing figures due later in the day.   Asian markets struggled again Friday following another selloff on Wall Street fuelled by recession fears, with warnings of a bleak outlook for the global economy as central banks slam on the brakes to battle soaring inflation. Data showing US consumers -- the backbone of the world's top economy -- were growing increasingly reticent about spending dealt a fresh blow to equities Thursday, with the S&P 500 suffering its worst January-June since 1970. With the war in Ukraine showing no sign of ending -- keeping energy costs elevated -- there is an expectation that borrowing costs will continue to rise and send economies into recession.   Asian currencies will wallow in the near-term, analysts forecast this week, with any respite from their first-half losses only likely to come in the form of proactive policy normalization by regional central banks combined with a Chinese recovery. A mix of elevated commodity prices and narrowing interest rate differentials have piled pressure on most Asian currencies, with some hitting multi-year lows in recent weeks. Foreign money has flowed out of emerging Asia, excluding China, for five months in a row in the face of a reluctance among central banks to hike rates. The Taiwanese dollar, South Korea's won and the Philippine peso have all weakened by more than 6.8% against a strong U.S. dollar this year, while the Indian rupee is near record lows. Mounting fears of a global recession have forced investors to flee stocks and riskier Asian assets in favor of bonds and the greenback, which recently hit a nearly two-decade high against major currencies. While Asian central banks have turned more hawkish recently to control spiking prices, a focus on growth and relatively controlled inflation has meant rate hikes have not been as aggressive as those by the U.S. Federal Reserve.   India’s ballooning trade gap and capital outflows are raising new risks for the rupee, just as the currency’s plunge to a record low adds to inflation woes. “India’s external balances are deteriorating,"" economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. wrote in a note Thursday, citing the terms-of-trade shock from higher commodities prices and weakening global growth. “Going forward, the trajectory of the rupee is likely to be pushed weaker versus the dollar on account of the deteriorating external balances."" While the Reserve Bank of India has begun raising rates, which usually supports currencies, the moves also deflate the domestic stock market, and can accelerate rupee-weakening outflows. Meanwhile, demand for dollars is rising, further pressuring the currency and forcing the RBI to dip into its reserves pile to support it. The central bank says the risks are so far manageable and the external sector is “well-buffered to withstand the ongoing terms-of-trade shocks and portfolio outflows.""   Bitcoin dip buyers are hoping things won’t get much worse for cryptocurrencies in the remainder of this year judging by the latest surge in the virtual coin. The largest digital token rallied as much as 11.3% at one point in Asian trading Friday and was at $20,300 as of 10:20 a.m in Tokyo, an 8% gain. The bout of optimism was also evident in coins such as Ether, Solana and Avalanche. Bitcoin has been gyrating around the $20,000 mark after a 56% slide this year. The retreat has become emblematic of depressed spirits in global markets as liquidity evaporates amid tightening monetary policy to fight inflation. Outrageous crypto swings have sometimes buffeted traditional assets this year. This time around, the latest jump higher failed to alleviate the gloom enveloping US equity futures, which remained in the red.   Tokyo stocks fell into negative territory in early trade on Friday after opening higher, tracking slumps on Wall Street. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index dropped 0.37 percent or 97.27 points to 26,295.77 yen in early trade after marking solid gains at the opening bell. The broader Topix index followed the same pattern and slipped 0.22 percent, or 4.04 points, to 1,866.78. The dollar stood at 135.90 yen, firmer than the 135.75 yen seen Thursday in New York.   Bob Michele kicked off his Wall Street career during the stagflation crisis of the early 1980s. More than four decades later, JPMorgan Asset Management’s chief investment officer says the economic outlook today looks even worse -- with a US recession now looking more likely than a soft landing. Central banks are a long way from reversing the most flagrant excesses of the easy-money era while inflation looks ever-more entrenched, per Michele. His pessimism is reflected in an historically bad first half of a year that’s just drawn to a close. Stocks and bonds around the world combined have fallen by the most on record, according to Bloomberg data going back to 1990, with $8 trillion wiped off the S&P 500 alone. “This current period is no doubt the most challenging in my career,"" Michele said in an interview. “You are stuck with a lot of liquidity in the system and rates that look ridiculously low relative to the levels of growth and inflation that we are seeing and where employment is."" With books now closed, the Nasdaq 100 has fallen nearly 30% in the first half while the MSCI World Index has shed more than 20%.   The selloff in stocks deepened after weak consumer-spending data fueled worries about a recession, with the S&P 500 suffering its cruelest first half since Richard Nixon’s presidency. It was a rout for the history books, with the equity gauge down about 21% in the first six months of the year -- the most for such a span since 1970. The superlatives kept piling up across Wall Street. Treasury 10-year yields sank to 3% from a decade-high of 3.5% in mid-June while the dollar had its best quarter since 2016. US consumer spending fell for the first time this year, suggesting an economy on somewhat weaker footing than previously thought amid rapid inflation and Federal Reserve hikes. A view that central banks need to act fast because they misjudged inflation has roiled markets, with traders ramping up bets the recovery will buckle under aggressive tightening. “The stagflation that has gripped our country right now is going to make it tough on the stock market over the intermediate term,"" said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. “When demand is not the key reason why inflation is a problem, a slower economy is not going to help bring inflation down as much as some experts seem to think."" Key segments of the world’s biggest bond market -- such as the difference between five and 10-year yields -- have inverted, signaling bets that higher rates will hurt the economy. Inversions have generally preceded recessions by about six to 18 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.   Wall Street stocks fell on Thursday, a fitting end to a bruising first half of 2022, finishing solidly lower after US data showed persistently high inflation pinching consumer spending. The broad-based S&P 500 finished at 3,785.38, down 0.9 percent for the day and a loss more than 16 percent for the last six months, the worst first half of a year since 1970. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.8 percent to 30,775.43, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 1.3 percent to 11,028.74. The market has fallen most of the year, breaking the trend only in late March and for other brief stretches in a fairly steady retreat. A series of bad inflation readings have prompted the Federal Reserve to undertake increasingly aggressive measures to try to rein in growth and pricing pressures.   World stock markets mostly sank Thursday on intensifying recession fears, while oil prices receded after an OPEC decision to proceed with a limited boost to output. London ended the day down two percent, with both Frankfurt and Paris close behind. That followed a largely downbeat performance in Asia, although Shanghai rose after data showed a forecast-beating improvement in China's services sector on easing Covid restrictions. Later on, Wall Street joined the sell-off, with major indices falling around one percent, concluding the S&P 500's worst first six months of a year since 1970. Crude futures slumped as major oil producers led by Saudi Arabia and Russia kept to a decision on a limited boost to output despite the risk that high oil prices may help push the global economy into recession.

Updated: 26 Jun 2022,"Bear days are numbered, build quality portfolio. These stocks are hot picks",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/bear-days-are-numbered-build-quality-portfolio-in-markets-these-stocks-are-hot-picks-11656263787991.html,"Markets recovered last week as equity benchmarks snapped a two-week losing streak as investors took a breather from inflation concerns due to the downside in commodity prices. Going forward, markets will continue to witness volatility as bearish stick still lingers with current macroeconomic risks, however, the days are numbered. The selling pressure is expected to be short-lived and experts have advised investors to build quality stocks portfolio. On Friday, Sensex finished at 52,727.98 up by 462.26 points or 0.88%. Nifty 50 closed at 15,699.25 higher by 142.60 points or 0.92%. Both the benchmarks have gained nearly 3% each from June 20 to 24. During these days, investors' wealth on BSE climbed by ₹7,40,977.89 crore. BSE market cap stood at ₹234,86,923.67 crore on June 20 and jumped to ₹242,27,901.56 crore on June 24. Research Analysts - Dharmesh Shah, Nitin Kunte, CMT, Pabitro Mukherjee, and Vinayak Parmar at ICICI Securities in their technical note said, equity benchmarks behaved contrary to our expectations as downbeat global cues tracking anxiety around rising inflation globally, rate hikes weighed on investor sentiments. On Nifty 50, they said the velocity of the decline accelerated on breach of March low of 15700 and drifted further to the 15200 mark. Going forward, the analysts said, ""We expect the index to gradually resolve higher and extend pullback towards the 16600 regions in coming months wherein strong support is placed in the vicinity of 14800-14600 zone, which we expect to hold as it is 80% retracement of CY-21 rally (13596-18604), at 14600. Thus, dips should be utilised to construct a portfolio by accumulating quality stocks in a staggered manner."" ICICI Securities analysts' positive bias is based on four factors: 1. The reading of the percentage of stocks above 200 DMA below 15 signifies extreme pessimism in the markets that eventually leads to a technical pullback to the tune of a minimum of 10% in the subsequent three months. 2. Index has already corrected 18% from the life highs and has approached oversold reading on the weekly momentum oscillator. The weekly RSI has approached its lowest level (placed at 35) since May 2020. Historically, a reading of 35 on weekly RSI has produced a decent pullback, and the analysts expect this rhythm to maintain in the coming months. 3. India continues to relatively outperform the EM basket even in the ongoing corrective phase despite significant selling by FIIs. Over the past one year, while the MSCI EM index has corrected over 40% from highs, India has relatively outperformed as the benchmark corrected only 18%. 4. The India VIX and crude oil prices have cooled off from the recent swing high. Indian Equities have an inverse correlation with the India VIX. Thus, providing impetus for the acceleration of ongoing pullback. They added, ""On the broader market front, in three instances over the past decade, intermediate correction in the Nifty Midcap, Small cap indices have been to the tune of 28% and 40%, respectively. At present, both indices have corrected 25% and 34%, respectively."" Therefore, the analysts said, ""any further correction is likely to be short-lived amid oversold territory and would set the stage for a technical pullback in coming weeks."" Here are the top picks of ICICI Securities analysts: BFSI - SBI, HDFC, Kotak Bank, Federal Bank, and Bajaj Finance. Telecom & Technology - Reliance, TCS, Infosys, L&T Infotech, HCL Technology, and Coforge. Capital goods - L&T, ABB, Siemens, BEL, AIA Engineering, ELGI Equipment, Sanghvi Movers, and Timken India. Consumption - Hindustan Unilever, Titan, ITC, Asian Paints, Tata Consumer, Havells India, Jubilant Foods, and Astral Poly. Auto - M&M, Maruti Suzuki, Ashok Leyland, Jamna Auto, Mahindra CIE, FIEM Industries, and Minda Industries. Infra and Realty - DLF LTD, Brigade Enterprise, and Phoenix Mills. Pharma & Chemicals - Divi's Laboratories, Cipla, Syngene, Torrent Pharma, and SRF Ltd. Metal - JSW Steel, Hindalco, and Graphite. Others - Adani Port, Indian Hotels, Zee Entertainment, Trent, Concor, Nocil, Balrampur Chinni, BDL, Bluedart, Dixon Technologies, Kansai Nerolac, and NRB Bearing. Markets weekly outlook: For the week June 27 to July 1, ICICI Direct analysts expect Nifty to eventually resolve past falling channel placed at 15800 and gradually head towards 16200 levels in coming weeks. In expiry week, use dips towards 15400 to create long positions as the index is poised at extreme oversold readings. ICICI Direct analysts added that brent oil prices have breached the weekly rising trend line indicating a loss of momentum and ""we expect upsides to be capped in 125-130 zone."" According to ICICI Direct analysts, amongst sectors preferences, IT, and BFSI are key sectors with favourable risk/reward, while Auto and Capital goods are expected to extend outperformance. The analysts prefer - SBI, HDFC, Kotak Bank, TCS, Maruti Suzuki, ITC, and Titan in large caps while in midcaps we like KPIT Technologies, Federal Bank, AIA Engineering, NRB Bearings, Ashok Leyland, Automotive Axles, Bharat Electronics, Havells, Trent, and Indian Hotel. Yesha Shah, Head of Equity Research, Samco Securities said, ""The coming week has a host of events arriving which could affect the mood of the market. Globally, investors will keenly analyze the US quarterly GDP growth rate numbers. The USA would officially enter into a recession if they post a negative growth and thus this could have a spill-over effect on global markets."" ""In India, the vehicle sales figures will continue to fuel stock-specific moves on D-Street as investors attempt to decipher the future trend,"" Shah added, ""Moreover, the monthly F&O expiry in the second half of the week may cause volatility in the indices. Investors are thus advised to accumulate good stocks with strong fundamentals, free cash flows, and lower leverage over the long run while disregarding short-term difficulties."""

However, despite strong rebound by Indian equity markets after Covid-19 swell-off, a good number of stocks are still reeling below pre-pandemic levels. But, some FMCG stocks like Britannia, ITC, Marico, Nestle, etc. have managed to regain pre-Covid highs and now they are quoting above pre-pandemic levels. Here we list out 5 FMCG stocks that are trading above pre-Covid levels: 1] ITC: In January 2020, ITC share price was around ₹235 apiece levels and it witnessed heavy beating post-Covid spread and touched a closing low of ₹158.25 per share levels in NSE. However, after strong rebound in Indian stock market post-Covid sell-off, ITC share remained a bears' favourite sell on rise stock till February 2022. However, from last week of February 2022, ITC share price has surged from around ₹213 to ₹270 levels, logging near 27 per cent rise in these four months time. Looking at ITC share price in pre-Covid times, the stock has surged from ₹235 to ₹270, quoting near 15 per cent above its pre-Covid levels. 2] Marico: In January 2020, Marico share price made a closing high of around ₹350 on NSE whereas Marico share price today is around ₹485. This means, this FMCG stock is trading around 40 per cent above its pre-Covid highs. After spread of Covid-19 pandemic, Marico share price made a closing low of ₹255.90 per share. However, after strong rebound post-pandemic sell-off, Marico share price appreciated to its new life-time high of ₹607.70 in October 2021. Then after, sell-off triggered in the FMCG stock and Marico share price slipped to its 852-week low of ₹455.65 January 2022.

Updated: 16 Jun 2022,ITC’s recovery decent amid volatile macros; Motilal Oswal upgrades rating,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/itcs-recovery-decent-amid-volatile-macros-motilal-oswal-upgrades-rating-11655361302609.html,"ITC Ltd’s shares have put up a good show in 2022, rising by about 20.6% so far in this calendar year versus the 2.2% drop in the sectoral Nifty FMCG index. Note that the stock had underperformed prior to this, which had rendered valuations lower. Amidst the broader market turmoil, investors are now valuing companies that generate good cash flows and were beaten down. ITC is a case in point. Moreover, ITC’s flagship cigarettes business is recovering faster. The company has said that its cigarette volumes in the March quarter have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services observe that while valuations of global tobacco peers have recovered to the levels seen in January 2019, ITC still trades at about 27% discount to its January 2019 valuations of 25.4 times one-year forward earnings per share (EPS). The ITC stock currently trades at Rs262.95 apiece, about 11% lower than the high seen in January 2019. The stability with respect to taxes on cigarettes has also helped sentiments towards the ITC stock. “This has enabled ITC to calibrate its price increases to avoid disrupting demand, unlike the higher tax increase environment between FY13 and FY17,"" said analysts at Motilal Oswal in a report on 15 June. Further, the outlook for ITC’s other segments is also looking upbeat. Products in the out-of-home categories in ITC’s FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) segment are seeing a revival in demand. Also, the opening up of schools, offices and colleges boost demand for stationery items. Even so, this segment faces headwinds from elevated input costs. As such, the movement in the segment’s margin would remain key monitorable. In the hotel segment, increased occupancies should boost revenues. Meanwhile, ITC stock trades at 17 times its estimated earnings for FY24, according to Bloomberg data. In comparison, other FMCG peers trade at higher multiples. For perspective: Hindustan Unilever Ltd and Britannia Industries Ltd trade at 44.6 times and 38.4 times their estimated earnings for FY24, respectively. Analysts at Motilal Oswal have upgraded their rating to Buy. “We value ITC at 21 times FY24E EPS, representing a 65% premium to its global peer average. We believe the premium multiples are justified, given its strong visibility over the medium-term and the defensive nature of its business, especially in a volatile macro environment,"" added the brokerage report. In FY22, ITC’s dividend payout stood at 93%. Payout is likely to remain elevated ahead in line with its dividend policy. All said, investors should watch out for adverse changes in taxes on cigarettes. That is a looming threat."
Updated: 16 Jun 2022,Why Motilal Oswal has upgraded ITC share price's rating to ‘Buy’,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/itc-share-price-motilal-oswal-upgrades-the-stock-to-buy-key-triggers-to-watch-11655348582231.html,"A better than expected demand recovery and a healthy margin outlook in Cigarettes, healthy sales momentum in the FMCG business, lower drag from the Hotels business, and better capital allocation in recent years leads Motilal Oswal to turn constructive on the ITC stock. The domestic brokerage and research firm has upgraded ITC shares' rating to buy and has a target price of ₹335 apiece as demand was quick to recover to pre-pandemic levels after the second covid wave and Motilal Oswal's channel checks suggest that demand remains robust. “While valuations of global Tobacco peers have been restored to their pre-pandemic levels (January 19), ITC still trades at a 27% discount to its Jan’19 valuations of 25.4x one-year forward EPS. We value ITC at 21x FY24E EPS, representing a 65% premium to its global peer average. We believe the premium multiples are justified, given its strong visibility over the medium-term and the defensive nature of its business, especially in a volatile macro environment,"" the note stated. A stable tax environment for Cigarettes in recent years has allowed ITC to calibrate price increases to avoid a disruption in demand. We expect this trend to continue and should result in improved Cigarette volumes and earnings visibility over the medium-term, as per the brokerage. The breadth of ITC’s FMCG product portfolio gives it an advantage in a rapidly changing demand environment. Its leadership position in some categories gives it pricing power to offset incremental input cost pressures in other categories, where pricing power is not as strong, Motilal Oswal added. Further, the resilient nature of its core business, amid an uncertain environment in the sector, and 4-5% dividend yield makes it a good defensive bet in the ongoing volatile interest rate environment. There has been relative stability with regard to taxes on Cigarettes in recent years. This has enabled ITC to calibrate its price increases to avoid disrupting demand, unlike the higher tax increase environment between FY13 and FY17. ""With the intensity of further COVID-19 waves decreasing, we now expect a volume growth of 3-4% over the next couple of years, especially if the tax incidence remains benign,"" Motilal Oswal's note stated.

After a weak start, the indices turned positive but, soon after, they gave up gains to end in the red. European markets opened mostly lower on Wednesday after gains in Asia as investors awaited greater clarity on where interest rates, inflation and economies are heading. Oil extended gains from the highest close in three months as the US summer driving season ramps up and China emerges from virus lockdowns.   Indian indices on Wednesday closed lower, extending run of losses, dragged by heavy selling pressure in market heavyweights Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, and ITC as RBI's monetary policy committee decided to increase repo rate by 50 bps to 4.9%. The Sensex fell 214.85 points, or 0.39%, to close at 54,892.49, while Nifty50 declined 60.10 points to end at 16,356.25. Sectorally, telecom, energy, FMCG, and power stocks, among others, came under selling pressure, while PSU banks and realty stocks received buying support. On the 30-stock index, the most gains were made by Tata Steel, SBI, DRL, and Bajaj Finance, among others, while Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, and ITC were among the biggest losers. On Nifty50, Tata Steel, SBI, and Titan made the most gains, while Airtel, ITC, RIL, and UPL were among the biggest laggards.   After more than a year of pressure from the United States and other top oil consuming countries, OPEC+ finally agreed to accelerate oil supply increases last week to tame runaway fuel prices and slow inflation. But that will leave producers with very little spare capacity, and almost no room to compensate for a major supply outage. Tight spare capacity is likely to keep oil prices volatile and sensitive to any disruptions in output, such as a big hit from a hurricane to Gulf of Mexico production during the Atlantic storm season, or a further fall in exports from sanctions-hit Russia. The most conservative estimates forecast OPEC's spare capacity dropping to below 1 million barrels per day (bpd) later this year, representing about 1% of global demand and barely one twentieth of U.S. demand. Only a handful of OPEC producers, namely Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have any meaningful spare capacity.

On the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange, cottonseed oil cake for June delivery fell by ₹15 or 0.53 per cent to ₹2,841 per quintal with an open interest of 52,460 lots. Analysts said sell-off by participants at existing levels amid subdued trend in market mainly weighed on cottonseed oil cake prices.   Copper prices on Wednesday increased by 0.19 per cent to ₹796.85 per kilogram in the futures market on the back of higher spot demand. On the Multi Commodity Exchange, copper contracts for delivery in June traded higher by ₹1.50 or 0.19 per cent at ₹796.85 per kg in a business turnover of 3,717 lots.

European markets opened mostly lower Wednesday after a day of gains in Asia as investors awaited greater clarity on where interest rates, inflation and economies are heading. Germany's DAX slipped 0.3% to 14,517.96 while the CAC 40 in Paris shed 0.2% to 6,489.76. Britain's FTSE 100 was little changed at 7,602.22. The futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials were 0.4% lower. “Equities are drifting lower as the broader narrative remains unchanged, with peak inflation optimism meeting increasingly hawkish pivots from central banks,"" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. In Asian trading, Hong Kong shares surged 2.2% to 22,014.59 on heavy buying of shares in Chinese technology companies after Beijing approved a new batch of video games. That was seen as a sign the business outlook for tech companies is improving after a prolonged regulatory crackdown. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 1% to 28,234.29 after Japan reported its economy contracted at a lower pace than earlier reported in the January-March quarter, shrinking 0.5% instead of 1%. The latest data showed consumer spending was not as weak as earlier thought.   European stocks slipped on Wednesday and Wall Street futures were in the red as worries that central bank tightening will stifle global growth weighed on markets. The World Bank on Tuesday slashed its global growth forecast by nearly a third to 2.9% for 2022, warning of a period of ""feeble growth and elevated inflation"", and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told senators that she expected inflation to remain high. Although Asian stocks strengthened overnight following Wall Street gains, market sentiment was volatile and European indexes were mostly down.   The brokerage company Sharekhan has maintained its positive stance on pharma stocks, despite the fact that Q4FY2022 was a poor quarter for pharmaceutical companies, plagued by higher cost pressures as increased raw material costs and freight costs pulled down profitability.   The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday raised the limit for auto-debit mandates on recurring payments done through cards and UPI (Unified Payment Interface) to ₹15,000 from ₹5,000.   The picture is not pretty for investors in paint stocks amid rising competition and persistently high input cost inflation. The exact impact of the former on incumbents is yet to be known. As far as the latter is concerned, companies have taken several rounds of price hikes in FY22 to contain gross margin erosion.   Mutual funds: Maintaining its hawkish stance on interest rate hike, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today announced to raise the repo rate by 50 bps leaving CRR unchanged. After this RBI policy announcement, investment experts are well convinced that Indian central bank's stance on inflation and interest rate is going to remain hawkish for short to medium term, which may require some tweak in one's mutual funds portfolio, especially in debt funds. They said that debt funds with short term view (not more than two year), should be preferred ahead of equity funds as ultra short and short term debt funds are expected to outperform equity mutual funds in upcoming 6 months to two years.   The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to raise the repo rate by 50 bps to 4.9 per cent during its monetary policy meeting on June 8, 2022, following a 40-basis-point rise on May 4, 2022. The outcome will have a direct impact on loan borrowers who are intending to take out a car loan, a home loan, a personal loan or a gold loan in the near future since banks and NBFCs are anticipated to raise lending rates. Borrowers would have to pay higher EMIs as loans become more costly on the back of a rise in the repo rate.   Drug maker Lupin on Wednesday said it has received tentative approval from the US health regulator to market Ivacaftor tablets, used to treat cystic fibrosis, in America. The company has received tentative approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for its abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for Ivacaftor tablets, 150 mg strength, Lupin said in a statement. The product is the generic equivalent of Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Kalydeco tablets, it added. The product will be manufactured at the company's Nagpur facility, the Mumbai-based drug maker said. As per IQVIA MAT March 2022 data, Ivacaftor tablets had estimated annual sales of USD 109 million in the US.   The monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) did what was expected of it and raised the repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.9%. Repo rate is the interest rate at which the RBI lends to banks. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage. The hike is expected to push up interest rates in the overall economy and thus dampen demand and help control inflation.   The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has issued directions to ban the use of coal in industrial, domestic and other miscellaneous applications in the entire Delhi-NCR region from January 1, 2023.   London copper prices edged lower on Wednesday, pressured by a firmer dollar, although demand optimism due to the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in top consumer China and declining inventories offered support. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was down 0.2% at $9,680 a tonne, as of 0717 GMT. The most-traded July copper contract in Shanghai ended daytime trading up 0.1% at 72,790 yuan ($10,911.24) a tonne.   The 50bps repo rate hike comes on the back of persistence of elevated inflation and the continued upside risks. Given that inflation is expected to remain above 6% through 3QFY23 , RBI has to frontload actions. We continue to see another 60-85bps hike in rest of FY23 to manage inflationary expectations.   On the expected lines, RBI unanimously re-emphasized its endeavour to contain inflation through withdrawal of the accommodative stance and normalisation of the policy rates. 50bps hike in the repo rate was very much factored in the 10yr yields which moved above 7.5% before the policy outcome, only to retreat lower to 7.45%. Markets are taking respite from the fact that the central bank did not move on the CRR hike, as feared earlier. On inflation, RBI now sees CPI average for FY23 to 6.7%, 100bps higher than the earlier estimate, with the revision primarily attributed to food prices. CPI inflation is likely to remain above the tolerance level of 6% till December 2022 and fall to 5.8% in Q4 FY23. RBI emphasized that the recent fiscal measures have moderated the inflation expectations. However, the inflation projection seemed to be a conservative one, as it assumes Oil to have peaked out and monsoon rainfall to be a normal one. So, the CPI projections are subject to revisions, depending on the magnitude of the supply-side risks. On growth, RBI retains GDP growth for FY23 at 7.2%, emphasising improving aggregate demand and capacity utilization in manufacturing. On the policy rate outlook, the pronounced priority to combat inflation has paved the path for further rate hikes, with the repo rate seen proximal to 5.75% by the end of FY23.   In the light of the uncertainty of persisting geopolitical tensions, concerns over rising global inflation and escalation in global crude oil prices and other commodities, we had expected the RBI to hike interest rates in consonance with the recent off-cycle policy meeting. The RBI has further hiked the repo rate by 50bps to 4.9% and will be focused on 'withdrawal of accommodation' to ensure inflation remains within target going forward while supporting growth. RBI further retained its FY23 GDP forecast at 7.2% on the back of recovery in urban demand and improving rural demand conditions along with expectations of normal monsoon. The push from the government on capex and increase in capacity utilization is likely to bolster well domestic economic activity. The RBI has also reiterated that they will ensure adequate liquidity in the banking system for productive purposes of the economy. We are optimistic that with pick up in both urban and rural demand, there will be a pick-up in demand for gold loans in the industry in the upcoming quarters.   Oil prices drifted higher on Wednesday, anticipating a report of low U.S. oil stocks, while expectations of solid demand in the upcoming driving season also lent support. Brent crude futures for August were up 40 cents, or 0.3%, at $120.97 a barrel at 0649 GMT after closing on Tuesday at the highest since May 31. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for July was at $120.01 a barrel, up 60 cents, or 0.5%, after reaching its highest settlement since March 8 in the previous session. Analysts polled by Reuters expect data for last week to show another drawdown of U.S. crude inventories, although gasoline and distillates stocks could edge higher. ""The oil market is expected to remain tight as the supply side will continue to tell a story of low inventories. Crude oil inventories will likely post more draws as driving season and vacationing heats up,"" OANDA analyst Edward Moya said in a note.   Bonds in India rallied, led by the short-end after the monetary authority refrained from withdrawing cash from the banking system and assured markets it would support the government’s record-borrowing program. The yield on four-year bonds fell as much as 15 basis points to 7.12% while the 10-year debt also declined by eight basis points to 7.44%. Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das said the central bank would take all steps needed to ensure an orderly completion of the borrowing plan, without giving details. “Gains on the shorter end are more because now traders are not expecting rates to be hiked at as fast a pace as the last three months,"" said Vijay Sharma, senior executive vice president at PNB Gilts. “It was a hawkish policy, but slightly less than what the market was expecting."" Yields on benchmark 10-year bonds hit a three-year high this week amid surging crude prices and a renewed rise in US yields. They are already up over 100 basis points this year. New Delhi plans to sell a record 14.31 trillion rupees of bonds this fiscal year.   Shares were mostly higher in Asia on Wednesday after U.S. stocks rallied on heavy buying of technology companies. Advancing Chinese technology shares also pushed Hong Kong sharply higher. Benchmarks likewise rose in other regional markets. Oil prices remained near $120 per barrel. Investors are waiting for more clarity on where interest rates, inflation and economies are heading. Japan's economy contracted at a 0.5% annual rate in the first quarter amid a major outbreak of coronavirus, the Cabinet Office reported. That was smaller than the 1.0% contraction in the preliminary estimate. The latest data showed consumer spending and other private demand was not as weak as earlier thought. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index gained 1% to 28,234.29 while the Kospi in South Korea was little changed at 2,626.14. In Sydney, the S&P/ASX 200 advanced 0.4% to 7,121.10. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped 2.1% to 21,987.92 as Chinese technology stocks surged after Beijing approved a new batch of video games. That was seen as a sign the business outlook for tech companies is improving after a prolonged regulatory crackdown. The Shanghai Composite index reversed early losses, gaining 0.5% to 3,259.24.   Reserve Bank of India (RBI) retained the real GDP projection of 7.2 per cent for the year FY 2022-23. Addressing a press conference following a three-day meeting of the RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on Wednesday announced that the inflation is now projected at 6.7 per cent. ""RBI has retained the real GDP projection of 7.2 per cent for the year FY 2022-23. With Q1 at 16.2 per cent, Q2 6.2 per cent, Q3 at 4.1 per cent and Q4 at 4 per cent with risk broadly balanced,"" the RBI Governor said in a press conference here. Citing the provisional estimates released by the National Statistical Office on May 31, Das said India's GDP growth ins 2021-22 is estimated at 8.7 per cent which has exceeded the pre-pandemic, that is, 2019-20 level. With the assumption of a normal monsoon, in 2022 and the average crude oil price in the Indian basket of 105 dollars per barrel, the RBI Governor said inflation is now projected at 6.7 per cent in 2022-23. ""Limits for individual housing loans extended by urban cooperative banks and rural cooperative banks, last fixed in 2011 and 2009 respectively, being revised upwards by over 100 per cent taking into account increase in house prices. It'll facilitate a better flow of credit to the housing sector,"" he said.   India's benchmark 10-year bond yield briefly jumped to 7.562%, its highest since March 14, 2019, before trading at 7.50% after the policy decision. The rupee was at 77.6925 against the dollar. ""The 50-bp repo rate hike comes on the back of persistently elevated inflation and continued upside risks,"" said Upasna Bhardwaj, chief economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank. ""Given that inflation is expected to remain above 6% through 3QFY23, the RBI has to front-load actions. We continue to see another 60-85 bp hikes in rest of FY23 to manage inflationary expectations.""   As expected, the repo rate was hiked by 50 bps to 4.90%. After the commentary of the RBI governor last month, the market has already expected a rate hike of 50bps in the June meeting. So now the RBI has taken a decision on the rate hike of 50bps. We believe that this rate hike is already priced in the market. Along with this bank, rates have also increased by 50bps to 5.15%, and withdrawal of the accommodative stance for the Indian economy. A good takeaway for the market is that RBI has retained the GDP forecast of 7.2% for FY2023 and CPI inflation is expected to be at 6.7% for FY2023. Overall the policy is in the expectation of the market, a 50bps rate hike is already priced in the market now the market focus will be on the Fed rate hike.   India's central bank on Wednesday hiked rates for a second time, as Asia's third-largest economy reels from galloping inflation in the wake of the Ukraine war. The Reserve Bank of India raised its key repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.90 percent, a month after kicking off an aggressive monetary tightening cycle with a surprise 0.4 percentage point lift in May. ""The war in Europe is lingering and we are facing newer challenges each passing day,"" Bank governor Shaktikanta Das said in a televised address, pointing to higher food and fuel prices. He added that inflation was a global problem but emerging economies were facing ""bigger challenges"", with market turbulence following monetary policy shifts in advanced economies.   The Reserve Bank of India's key interest rate was raised by 50 basis points on Wednesday as widely expected, in the second hike in as many months, in a bid to cool persistently high inflation. The monetary policy committee (MPC) raised the key lending rate or the repo rate by 50 basis points (bps) to 4.90%. The Standing Deposit Facility rate and the Marginal Standing Facility Rate were adjusted higher by the same quantum to 4.65% and 5.15%, respectively. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said a June 8 move was a ""no brainer"". But analysts polled by Reuters had been divided over how much it would hike, with forecasts ranging between 25 and 75 bps. Wednesday's increase follows a 40-bps rise in early May at an unscheduled meeting that kicked off the central bank's tightening cycle, which economists expect to be relatively short. ""Upside risks to inflation as highlighted in last policy meetings have materialized earlier than expected,"" Das said after the policy decision. He said inflation will likely remain above the RBI's upper tolerance band in the first three quarters of the financial year that started on April 1. Retail inflation in April accelerated to 7.79% from a year earlier, above the RBI's tolerance band for inflation of 2% to 6% for a fourth month in a row, and a further rise in global prices of crude oil, food and other commodities is expected to keep up the upward pressure. The price spikes have hammered consumer spending and darkened the near-term outlook for India's economic growth, which slowed to the lowest in a year in the first three months of 2022. India's central bank maintained its growth projection at 7.2% for 2022/23.   RBI retains FY23 GDP growth forecast at 7.2%   The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will be announcing the outcome of its June policy meeting today and Governor Shaktikanta Das is widely expected to increase the repo rate again to contain soaring inflation, after an off-cycle hike last month.   The rupee strengthened by 9 paise to 77.69 against the US dollar in opening trade on Wednesday, ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy decision. A weak trend in domestic equities, surging crude oil prices and unabated foreign fund outflows capped the appreciation bias of the rupee, forex dealers said. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is slated to announce its policy decision later in the day. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened strong at 77.70 against the US dollar, then gained further ground to quote 77.69, registering a rise of 9 paise over the last close. In the previous session, the rupee had closed at a record 77.78 against the US dollar.   Amid rising inflation concerns in the economy, all eyes are on today's Monetary Policy Meeting outcome as experts believe that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to increase the repo rate by 25 to 50 basis points (BPS). RBI will announce the credit policy at 10 am today.   Indian shares swung between gains and losses on Wednesday ahead of a widely expected rate hike decision by the central bank, which is trying to bring down inflation from an eight-year high while also keeping an eye on slowing economic growth. The NSE Nifty 50 index was down 0.06% at 16,411.20, as of 0349 GMT, while the S&P BSE Sensex fell 0.03% to 55,094.84. After an unscheduled 40 basis point repo rate hike in May to 4.40%, economists polled by Reuters expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to raise it by 25 to 75 basis points on Wednesday.   4 stocks to buy today — 8th June   Share price of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) slumped to a new record low of ₹751 on Tuesday, which is over 20 per cent down from its IPO issue price of ₹949. At the BSE, Life Insurance Corporation of India's shares closed 3.15 per cent down at ₹752.90 against its previous day's close at ₹777.40. LIC share price hit a record low of ₹751 in the intra-day. The scrip also hit a record closing low of ₹752.90. There has been a consistent decline in the share price of the government-run insurer. Life Insurance Corporation of India shares got listed on the stock exchanges on May 17. Since its listing, the scrip has closed in the positive four sessions. For the rest of the days, it witnessed selling pressure.   The World Bank on Tuesday cut India's economic growth forecast for the current fiscal to 7.5 per cent as rising inflation, supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions taper recovery. This is the second time that the World Bank has revised its GDP growth forecast for India in the current fiscal 2022-23 (April 2022 to March 2023). In April, it had trimmed the forecast from 8.7 per cent to 8 per cent and now it is projected at 7.5 per cent. The GDP growth compares to an 8.7 per cent expansion in the previous 2021-22 fiscal. ""In India, growth is forecast to edge down to 7.5 percent in the fiscal year 2022/23, with headwinds from rising inflation, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical tensions offsetting buoyancy in the recovery of services consumption from the pandemic,"" the World Bank said in its latest issue of the Global Economic Prospects.   The global economy is on track to grow by 2.9 percent in 2022, down 1.2 percentage points from the January projection, the World Bank Group said in its latest Global Economic Prospects released on Tuesday, warning of stagflation risk. Compounding the damage from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war has magnified the slowdown in the global economy, which is entering what could become a protracted period of feeble growth and elevated inflation, the report said. This raises the risk of stagflation, with potentially harmful consequences for middle- and low-income economies alike, according to the report. Global growth is expected to slump from 5.7 per cent in 2021 to 2.9 per cent in 2022 and hover around that pace over 2023-2024, the report showed.   The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to hike the policy repo rate by 40 basis points to 4.80 per cent on Wednesday and increase the inflation forecast for the current fiscal to above 6 per cent from its earlier projection of 5.7 per cent, according to market analysts and economists. The six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the RBI is certain to hike the policy interest rates as inflation has remained above the central bank's tolerance limit for the past several months. In a recent interview, RBI Governor Das said that the expectation of rate hikes in June is a ""no-brainer"". While the rate hike is certain, as RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had indicated last month, the question remains on by how much? ""We expect the RBI to hike repo rate by 40 bps in the June policy meeting. However, we should be open for a rate hike between 35-50 bps hinging on how the MPC wants to reach the pre-pandemic repo rate of 5.15 per cent or around that mark by the end of August policy,"" said Suvodeep Rakshit, Senior Economist at Kotak Institutional Equities. Last month, in its off-cycle monetary policy review the central bank hiked the policy repo rate by 40 basis points or 0.40 per cent to 4.4 per cent. This was the first increase in the policy repo rate in nearly two years. The repo rate is the interest rate at which the RBI lends short-term funds to banks. Inflation has been above the RBI's 2-6 per cent target band since the beginning of this year.As per the latest available data, India's Consumer Price Index (CPI) based inflation surged to an eight-year high of 7.79 per cent in April. It has been above 6 per cent since January 2022.   Gold prices were little changed on Wednesday as investors awaited the U.S. inflation report this week for further cues on the economy as central banks worldwide seek to cool surging prices. FUNDAMENTALS * Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1,850.41 per ounce, as of 0037 GMT, while U.S. gold futures added 0.1% to $1,853.30. * The World Bank on Tuesday slashed its global growth forecast by nearly a third to 2.9% for 2022, warning that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has compounded the damage from the COVID-19 pandemic, and many countries now faced recession. * The U.S. trade deficit narrowed by the most in nearly 9-1/2 years in April as exports jumped to a record high, putting trade on course to contribute to economic growth this quarter.   Oil prices edged up on Wednesday ahead of data on U.S. oil inventories, with crude futures supported by tight supplies and recovering fuel demand as China's top cities relax COVID-19 curbs. Brent crude futures for August rose 22 cents, or 0.2%, to $120.79 a barrel by 0012 GMT after closing at the highest since May 31 on Tuesday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for July was at $119.65 a barrel, up 24 cents, or 0.2%, after reaching its highest settlement since March 8 on Tuesday. Analysts polled by Reuters expect another drawdown of U.S. crude inventories in data for last week although gasoline and distillates stocks could edge higher.   U.S. stocks rallied Tuesday as Treasury yields eased, but Wall Street remains wobbly as investors wait for more clarity on where interest rates, inflation and the economy are heading. The S&P 500 climbed 39.25 points, or 1%, to 4,160.68 after reversing a morning loss of 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 264.36 points, or 0.8%, to 33,180.14 after it also bounced between losses and gains throughout the day. The Nasdaq composite gained 113.86 points, or 0.9%, to 12,175.23. Gains by Apple, Microsoft and other technology stocks were some of the biggest forces lifting the market. They benefited from a drop in Treasury yields, with the 10-year yield falling back below 3%. Lower yields in recent years have emboldened investors to pay higher prices for stocks, particularly companies that are growing quickly. Stocks of energy producers also jumped as oil prices rose to roughly $120 per barrel, up more than 55% for the year so far. Exxon Mobil climbed 4.6%, and ConocoPhillips added 4.5%.   Tokyo stocks opened higher on Wednesday, tracking Wall Street rallies, with a cheap yen giving some support to exporters. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was up 0.61 percent, or 169.99 points, at 28,113.94, while the broader Topix index was up 0.45 percent, or 8.71 points, at 1,955.74. Investors in Tokyo ""are likely to test the ceiling of today's trade"" and actively buy after rallies on Wall Street, Okasan Online Securities said in a note. ""A sense of short-term overheating will be offset by the yen's depreciation against the dollar,"" it added. The dollar fetched 132.80 in early Asian trade, against 132.62 yen in New York late Tuesday.   Hong Kong shares started Wednesday with a big gain following a strong lead from Wall Street, with tech firms again seeing huge buying interest on hopes a long-running crackdown on the sector by China is coming to an end. The Hang Seng Index jumped 1.19 percent, or 257.22 points, to 21,788.89. The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.10 percent, or 3.25 points, to 3,245.02, while the Shenzhen Composite Index on China's second exchange ticked up 0.06 percent, or 1.30 points, to 2,073.88.   Stocks in Asia rose Wednesday after gains in US equities and as a pullback in bond yields provided some respite for investors fretting that higher rates will slow down growth. An MSCI Inc. gauge of Asia-Pacific shares advanced led by Hong Kong and Japan. China was little changed. US futures slipped after the S&P 500 wiped out last week’s losses with back-to-back advances and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 also climbed. Treasury yields edged higher. The long end of the Treasury curve led a rally, pushing 10-year yields below the 3% level and flattening the curve as Target Corp.’s latest profit forecast underscored a grim outlook for US consumer spending. Shorter-dated maturities lagged, weighed by weak demand at an auction. A dollar gauge rose, while the yen dipped further after sliding to a 20-year low.  "
Updated: 07 Jun 2022,UP's monkeypox case latest update: 5-yr-old girl tests negative,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/ups-monkeypox-case-latest-update-5-yr-old-girl-tests-negative-11654593581856.html,"The suspected case of monkeypox from Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad has tested negative, news agency ANI reported. The sample was sent to ICMR - National Institute of Virology in Pune for testing.  On Saturday, a 5-year-old girl complained of itching and rashes on her body, following which, fears regarding a possible monkeypox outbreak gripped the entire region. Her samples were later sent for testing. The government health sources, however, said it is ""unnecessary panic mongering"" and that no cases of the disease have been reported from India so far. Ghaziabad Chief Medical Officer said the test was just a ""precautionary measure"" as the girl has no other health issues and did not have close contact with anyone who has travelled abroad in the past month. ""Samples of a five-year-old girl have been collected for testing for monkeypox, as a precautionary measure, as she had complaints of itching and rashes on her body. She has no other health issues and neither she nor any of her close contacts travelled abroad in the past month,"" CMO Ghaziabad said.  Owing to the rising number of cases in some non-endemic countries, the Union Health Ministry last week issued ""Guidelines on Management of Monkeypox Disease"" to ensure advance preparedness.  According to the guidelines, a confirmed case is laboratory confirmed for Monkeypox virus by detection of unique sequences of viral DNA either by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or sequencing. ""All the clinical specimens should be transported to the Apex Laboratory of ICMR-NIV (Pune) routed through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) network of the respective district/state,"" it said in the guidelines. The Guidelines on Management of Monkeypox Disease include the epidemiology of the disease (including host, incubation period, period of communicability and mode of transmission; contact and case definitions; clinical features and its complication, diagnosis, case management, risk communication, guidance on Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) including use of personal protective equipment. ""Contacts should be monitored at least daily for the onset of signs or symptoms for a period of 21 days (as per case definition) from the last contact with a patient or their contaminated materials during the infectious period,"" the guidelines read.

Updated: 07 Jun 2022,India’s wheat berths at Israeli port awaiting final destination,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/indias-wheat-berths-at-israeli-port-awaiting-final-destination-11654537215739.html,"The 56,000-tonne Indian durum wheat consignment, turned back by Egypt and Turkey, is currently berthed at an Israeli port as it awaits news of a final destination, government officials said. The officials, however, denied there was any link between the consignment’s rejection and the current political furore in West Asia over anti-Islamic remarks made by suspended Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Nupur Sharma. The Indian government maintains that the consignment exported by ITC Ltd had met quarantine requirements when it left India. “The wheat shipment was turned down by Turkey because the wheat’s protein content was below 13-14%, which is a key food safety regulation for Turkey and Egypt had turned away the shipment without drawing any samples for testing,"" the official said. “Usually the government does not get involved in such situations because the financial transaction was done and the ITC was paid. But because it was Indian wheat we are keeping track,"" the official added. Mint had earlier reported that the wheat shipment was sold to the Netherlands, but it was diverted to Turkey and then to Egypt. Both the countries did not accept the wheat amid reports that the consignment had a non-plant based virus. The shipment left India before a ban was announced on wheat exports on 13 May. The shipment could be valued in millions as the price of wheat internationally has jumped sharply after the Russia-Ukraine war. Wheat price in the international market is around $450- 480 per tonne, as per the Ministry of Consumer Affairs. “The reason for rejection was the protein content and not phytosanitary issues,"" one of the officials said, adding that political reasons may also be at play. However, another official said that although India shares testy relations with some countries, international trade stands on its own legs. “Our relations with Saudi Arabia are not the best, but we buy oil. Political issues have little to do with trade,"" the second official added. When a shipment is rejected, there are usually three options -- the exporter can destroy it, divert it or bring it back to the original source, an expert said, adding that destroying a shipment is usually the last option but it has happened in the past. Also, wheat is not a perishable commodity and is often stored in India for months, the expert added. Last week, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said that the government is investigating the reason behind Turkey’s rejection. Queries sent to the spokespersons of the commerce and industry ministry, ITC and the Embassies of Israel, Egypt and Turkey did not elicit a response till press time. ITC maintains that it exported to Netherlands customers on FOB (free on board) terms and that the cargo was loaded after being checked and cleared by both the buyer-nominated surveyors as well as by the plant quarantine authorities. FOB is a shipment term used to indicate whether the seller or the buyer is liable for goods that are damaged or destroyed during shipping. Experts said that India’s farm exports have often been rejected due to phytosanitary issues. Earlier this year, Indonesia suspended Indian farm exports after reporting quality issues. In addition, India failed to register laboratories that test food safety and issue a certificate of analysis."

No monkeypox case has been reported in India so far. A five-year-old girl in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad is being tested for monkeypox after she complained of itching and rashes on her body. The Chief Medical Officer of Ghaziabad said that the test is just a ""precautionary measure"" as the girl has no other health issues, nor does she have close contact with anyone who has travelled abroad in the past month. ""Samples of a five-year-old girl have been collected for testing for monkeypox, as a precautionary measure, as she had complaints of itching and rashes on her body. She has no other health issues and neither she nor any of her close contacts travelled abroad in the past one month,"" CMO Ghaziabad said. Recently, the Central government issued guidelines on monkeypox cases. The government directed district surveillance units to consider even one such case as an outbreak and initiated a detailed investigation through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme. The Union Health Ministry stressed augmenting surveillance and rapid identification of new cases as the key public health measures to contain any outbreak. The guidelines proposed a surveillance strategy to rapidly identify cases and clusters of infections and the sources of infections as soon as possible in order to isolate cases to prevent further transmission, provide optimal clinical care, identify and manage contacts and protect frontline health workers and effective control and preventive measures based on the identified routes of transmission. Monkeypox has been reported as endemic in several other central and western African countries. However, cases have been also reported in certain non-endemic countries like the US, the UK, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Australia, Canada, Austria, Israel and Switzerland. The health ministry said it continues to maintain a close watch over the evolving situation. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 30 non-endemic countries have reported more than 550 confirmed cases of monkeypox so far."

The first lab is being established at the Amul Fed Dairy in Ahmedabad and subsequently the other 5 labs will come up at various location across India,"" Sodhi said.

Strong results for the fourth quarter and for the financial year 2021-22, are the proximate triggers. But the robust results for segments such as cigarettes and paper and paper products indicate that the pandemic is behind us, and that the market also now views the pandemic in the rear-view mirror. The pandemic had taken a toll on cigarette sales, with lockdowns curbing mobility and cigarette sales and covid-19’s direct effects on lungs and the respiratory tract pouring cold water on the enthusiasm to light up. The latest results show that cigarette sales have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. The segment’s revenue has grown 10% and earnings before interest and tax by 12%. Strong corporate performance alone might not be the reason for ITC’s new-found favour with investors and brokerages. The company has been undervalued for some time. While there are no diversified tobacco majors around for a proper comparison, comparing ITC with a sterling fast-moving consumer goods company such as Hindustan Unilever (HUL) would be useful (while cigarettes remain the cash cow for ITC, the bulk of the company’s recent investments and manpower addition has been in non-cigarette divisions such FMCG, hotels, stationery, paper and paper products).

Updated: 20 May 2022,ITC’s recovery on track; sustaining it is crucial,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/itcs-recovery-on-track-sustaining-it-is-crucial-11652985236940.html,"In the recent months, there has been some excitement around the prospects of ITC Ltd’s cigarettes business. The expectation was that improved mobility and the easing of covid restrictions would help sales of cigarettes. Signs of this are visible. The company has said, cigarette volumes in the March quarter (Q4FY22) have surpassed pre-pandemic levels despite disruptions because of the Omicron wave. Analysts estimate last quarter’s cigarette volume growth at 9% year-on-year (y-o-y). Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) growth stood at 12%. Cigarettes are ITC’s mainstay, contributing 82% of the standalone segmental Ebit in Q4.    "
Updated: 19 May 2022,ITC stock lights up on margin surprise across segments in Q4,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/itc-stock-at-a-new-high-as-margins-surprise-across-segments-in-q4-11652941758308.html,"Shares of ITC Ltd. hit a fresh 52-week high of ₹279.25 apiece in opening deals on Thursday, a day when broader markets tanked. This jump in the company's shares was due to margin expansion across segments at a time when many consumer companies have been facing acute margin pressure due to higher costs. For the March quarter (Q4FY22), ITC’s mainstay cigarette business saw 10% and 12% year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in revenues and earnings before interest and tax (Ebit), respectively. The segment accounted for as much as 82% of ITC’s segmental Ebit. What is more, volumes surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Analysts estimate Q4 cigarette volume growth at around 9%. However, on a three-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) basis, volume growth has been muted at 1.3%, according to analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. ITC’s FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) segment’s Ebitda increased 22.5% y-o-y and margin grew 75 basis points (bps) despite cost pressures. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. One basis point is 0.01%.  For instance, prices of edible oil surged nearly 31% year-on-year in the March quarter, according to the company. Ebitda growth was led by discretionary/out-of-home categories supported by increased mobility. The company said its hygiene portfolio faced demand volatility, with covid cases waning but revenue levels remained above pre-covid levels. Other segments such as hotels saw sequential rise in average room rates but remained below pre-pandemic levels. While Ebit loss in Q4 narrowed on year, the business had reported a profit in Q3. Agri business recorded about a 30% surge in segment revenue led by wheat, rice, and leaf tobacco exports. Paperboard volumes touched new highs in the quarter. Overall, net standalone revenue and Ebitda grew 16.8% y-o-y each to ₹15,531 crore and ₹5,224 crore, respectively. Ebitda margin was flattish year-on-year. “ITC offers a combination of reasonable valuations, healthy dividend yield, and double-digit earnings growth over FY2022-24E led by recovery in cigarettes, hotels and steady/healthy performance in FMCG and paperboards,"" said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a report on 19 May. Even so, higher dependence on cigarettes business poses risk as ESG (environment, social and governance) issues with respect to tobacco would weigh on valuation multiples. As analysts from Motilal Oswal point out, longer term re-rating will be subject to diversification from cigarettes. They added, “ITC’s re-rating would depend on sustained earnings growth going back to the high-teens levels witnessed in the first half of the last decade (at 18% CAGR) which had slowed down to 6.6% CAGR over the latter half of the decade."" For now, amid sharp inflationary pressures, ITC seems to be relatively better placed and is witnessing a recovery across segments. This reflects in the recent excitement for the stock, which has gained more than 25% so far this calendar year."
Updated: 19 May 2022,ITC shares rise to multi-year high after Q4 top estimates. Should you buy?,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/itc-shares-should-you-buy-post-q4-results-11652927092617.html,"Shares of ITC rose to highest in 3 years in Thursday's opening deals after the FMCG major posted 12% growth in net profit to ₹4,195 crore for the January-March period, compared with ₹3,755 crore a year ago. The Kolkata-based company's revenue from operations rose 15% to ₹17,754 crore as against ₹15,404 crore in the last year period. FMCG revenue grew 12.3% during the quarter to ₹4,141.9 crore, while cigarette revenue rose 10% to ₹6,443. The hotels business reported segment revenue of ₹389.6 crore during the quarter, up 35.3% from a year earlier. Analysts at JPMorgan have upgraded ITC shares to overweight with a March 2023 price target of ₹305. “In our view ITC offers a good combination of earnings visibility for FY23, strong cash flows and high dividend yield. We believe the stock should do well in current volatile markets as a good defensive play with undemanding valuations,"" the note stated. “We largely retain our FY23/24e EPS estimates. While FMCG peers combat growth slowdown and RM pressures, ITC is seeing a recovery in earnings, with good momentum across verticals and high margin visibility. Higher dividend payout and lower capex are also encouraging,"" said Jefferies. It has retained Buy rating on ITC shares with price target of ₹305. Paperboards, paper and packaging revenue stood at ₹2,182.7 crore in the fourth quarter as against ₹1,655.9 crore in the same period last year, the company said adding re-opening of educational institutions aided recovery but it was still below pre-pandemic levels. “As the cigarette business has started re-gaining market share from illicit trades, we believe that the margins would improve in the business. Hence, we have raised our target price to ₹293 (SOTP valuation) and upgraded the stock to Accumulate,"" said brokerage Dolat Capital.

The move was in line with Asian peers, which traded sharply lower after a brutal selloff on Wall Street sent the S&P 500 down by the most since June 2020. Shares fell in Japan, South Korea, Australia, and Hong Kong, while it gained marginally in Shanghai.  Indian indices on Thursday tanked massively, tracking extremely weak trends, with heavy losses recorded in market heavyweights Reliance, SBI, TCS, Infosys, among others. High crude prices and foreign fund outflows further ruined already sluggish market sentiments. The Sensex lost 1416.30 points, or 2.61%, to close at 52,792.23, while Nifty50 declined 430.90 points to end at 15,809.40. Sectorally, all the sectors ended in the red, with metal and IT stocks slipping the most. On the 30-stock index, only ITC and DRL managed to post gains, while Wipro, HCL, Infosys, and TCS were among the biggest losers. On Nifty50, ITC, DRL, and PowerGrid ended in the green, while HCL, Wipro, TCS, Infosys, and TechM were among the biggest laggards.   Shares of Lupin Ltd fell around 7% on Thursday on the National Stock Exchange. Investors are visibly displeased with the company’s March quarter results announced late on Wednesday.   Many Indian companies continue to struggle in the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) space, although there is marked improvement in the corporate space.

Multibagger stock: The Board of Directors of Steel Exchange India Ltd has recommended subdivision of shares into 1:10, which is subject to approval of the members of the company in General Meeting.

The issue will open for public subscription next week on Tuesday, May 24 and conclude on May 26. The bidding for anchor investors will open on May 23.   We maintain our BUY rating, valuing IGL at ₹520/sh on SOTP basis, (IGL-SA: ₹500/sh MNGL: ₹14.6/sh; CUGL: ₹6.5/sh). Our TP is premised upon an earnings CAGR of ~10% (FY21-30e), for IGL-SA, driven by a ~11% CAGR(FY21-30e) in gas sales and EBITDA per unit of ~6.5/unit.   IRB Infrastructure is one of the largest BOT toll operators in the country having market share of ~20% in the total Golden Quadrilateral projects, with over 3,700km of total projects successfully executed. Deal with GIC alongwith arbitration awards with respect to Pathankot Amritsar Toll project and Goa tollway project amounting to Rs7.9bn has further strengthen the balance sheet and reduce the debt level. Since most of the projects have received PCOD and new projects are yet to receive AD, we have revised our construction revenue from Rs51.8bn to Rs48.2bn in FY24. We expect IRB to report revenue/EBITDA CAGR of 13%/13% over FY22/FY24E and ROE of ~14% in FY24E. We maintain with a BUY with a revised SOTP of Rs328/shares, implying an upside potential of 54% from the current levels.

According to market observers, shares of Ethos are available at a premium of ₹10 in grey market today.   Growth momentum in the global economy is slowing down due to liquidity tightening by Central Banks. Russia – Ukraine conflict is also not showing any signs of easing with newer categories of weapons introduced in the conflict, which will keep Energy and Food prices high. Both these variables point to a stagflation kind of scenario globally, which can lead to discretionary spending going down. This is fueling greater volatility in global equity markets, including in India. We expect markets to remain volatile in the near term but expect better market conditions in the second half of the financial year once markets price in the impact of global slowdown and higher rates. So sectors which we like are good quality private sector banks, Oil Refiners and exploration companies, Agri linked companies including tractor manufacturers, Hospitality, Film Exhibitors and Hospitals.   We cut earnings estimates significantly for FY23/24 by assuming much lower growth in Gold AUM (due to structural competition and stoppage of low rate scheme), slower growth in Microfinance portfolio (challenges with quality and capital), gradual recovery in gold portfolio yield and likely continuance of elevated credit cost in microfinance. However, we retain ADD rating on the stock in the light of estimated 4%/16% RoA/RoE delivery in FY23-24 and that stock/valuation (0.8x/5x FY24 PABV/PE) seems to be largely discounting headwinds in gold and MFI businesses. Key risks to our view would be re-introduction of teaser/lower rate schemes by market/competition and capital call at Asirvad Microfinance (given abs. PAR net of ECL is nearly equal to NW). Manappuram’s dilemma of choosing between growth and profitability is structural, given its weak customer acquisition engine and borrower stickiness.   Shares of ITC Ltd. hit a fresh 52-week high of ₹279.25 apiece in opening deals on Thursday, a day when broader markets tanked. This jump in the company's shares was due to margin expansion across segments at a time when many consumer companies have been facing acute margin pressure due to higher costs.   Dividend paying stock: After Board of Directors of JK Lakshmi Cement Limited recommending 100 per cent dividend for FY2021-22, JK share price surged over 14 per cent in early morning deals on Thursday.

The Board of Directors of JK Lakshmi Cement Limited had recommended 100 per cent dividend in financial year 2021-22 on Wednesday i.e. 18th May 2022.   In April, inflows into systematic investment plans (SIPs) of mutual funds fell around 3.8% month-on-month to ₹11,863 crore. A SIP is a mode of investment primarily into equity mutual funds. In that sense, an investor investing through the SIP route is largely buying stocks indirectly. In fact, in the seven-month period from October 2021 to April 2022, total investments made through the SIP route stood at Rs79,975 crore.   Gold prices were flat on Thursday, as an elevated U.S. dollar and rising Treasury yields weighed on greenback-priced bullion, with the metal's outlook already dampened by an aggressive Federal Reserve stance on inflation. Spot gold held its ground at $1,813.96 per ounce, as of 0512 GMT. U.S. gold futures were flat at $1,813.40. Gold's daily closing price is effectively hugging the trendline projected from the March 2020 (pandemic) low, and intraday volatile spikes either side of that key trendline have lacked conviction to prompt a sustainable move, City Index's senior market analyst Matt Simpson said.   Multibagger stock: After Covid-19 fueled sell-off in 2020, Indian stock market made its bottom on 23rd March 2020. After making its bottom, Indian market rebounded strongly in pull-back rally. In this post-Covid rally, the Dalal Street produced a good number of multibagger stocks. Tata Power shares are one of such multibagger stocks produced by the Dalal Street in post-Covid rally. In last two years after market bottom, this Tata Power share price has risen from around ₹30 to ₹237.50 levels, logging near 700 per cent return in this period. The multibagger stock has managed to give this much of return to its shareholders despite heavy sell-off in last few months after the outbreak of Russia-Ukraine war.   Oil marketing companies (OMCs) have raised prices of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) by ₹3.5, pushing up the cost of a 14.2 kg cylinder of cooking gas to ₹1,003 in the national capital. This is the second hike in LPG prices this month.   Stock market today: Shares of Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited hit upper circuit on fifth straight session today. Chennai Petroleum share price today opened downside at ₹305 apiece on NSE but soon started ascending and hit new 52-week high of ₹329.45 levels.

A total of four stocks have been put under the ban for trade on Thursday, May 19, 2022 under the futures and options (F&O) segment by the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

DLF has seen strong traction in its residential business with FY22 sales bookings of Rs72.7bn in FY22 vs. Rs30.8bn in FY21 driven by the Dec’21 launch of the One Midtown Delhi project and new launches across plots/independent floors in Gurugram and Chennai. With 7.6msf of new launches lined up in FY23E, we model for sales bookings of Rs75.6bn in FY23E and Rs79.3bn in FY24E. Further, with office re-openings and mall consumption picking up, we model for DCCDL rental EBITDA of Rs41.3bn in FY23E and Rs44.2bn in FY24E vs. Rs33.3bn achieved in FY22. We retain our BUY rating with a revised SoTP based target price of Rs446/share (earlier Rs434) as we roll forward to Mar23E NAV. Key risks are weakness in office leasing and residential demand   Bharti’s FCF generation has grown to Rs58.5bn in Q4FY22, and if we adjust for negative working capital (seasonality), it has reached quarterly run-rate of Rs70bn. This should help deleverage in coming quarters; near-term bump includes 5G spectrum auction. However, Bharti has cash infusion pending from Google and partly paid rights issue. We have marginally tweaked our EBITDA estimate and our SoTPbased target price now works out to Rs812 (earlier: Rs850). Maintain BUY.   Sustained improvement in GRMs, attractive valuations, bonus issue (1:2 declared with Q4 result) and robust dividend yield (@>10% for FY22) coupled with our assumptions of some normalcy returning to marketing margins over the next 12 months, make IOCL an attractive play at current prices. Re-initiating coverage on IOCL with BUY rating, TP of Rs165/sh, ~~40% upside from CMP.   Indian IT stocks have underperformed the benchmark Nifty by 15% in year-to-date (YTD) terms as the earnings outlook has worsened over the current earnings season.

Britain's inflation rate has surged to a 40-year high on soaring energy costs, official data showed Wednesday, sparking calls for an emergency government budget to combat a worsening cost-of-living crisis. Annual inflation soared to 9.0 percent in April from 7.0 percent in March, the Office for National Statistics said, delivering another heavy blow to Britons whose wages were already failing to keep pace with surging prices. April's headline figure marked the highest inflation rate since 1982, the ONS added.   JSW Infrastructure Ltd., a unit of tycoon Sajjan Jindal’s steel-to-cement conglomerate, is planning an initial public offering by March 2024. The Mumbai-based company, which operates seaports and terminals, will soon start the process of engaging investment bankers and professional agencies to facilitate the listing, Joint Managing Director Arun Maheshwari said in an interview. The firm will take a “balanced view"" on geopolitical risks and inflationary pressures among other factors while deciding on the timing for the listing, he said.   London copper prices were flat on Thursday, as mounting worries over a global economic slowdown amid aggressive policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve and ongoing lockdowns in China dented investors' risk appetite. * Benchmark three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was steady at $9,236.50 a tonne, as of 0213 GMT, after dropping 1.4% in the previous session. * The most-active June copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was down 0.5% at 71,380 yuan ($10,556.36) a tonne. * China has policy room to cope with challenges, as the downward pressure on China's economy increases, state media quoted Premier Li Keqiang as saying on Wednesday.   Safe-haven currencies, including the dollar, eased on Thursday, pausing for breath after big gains the previous session as Wall Street stocks tumbled amid mounting concerns that aggressive tightening by the Federal Reserve and other global central banks could choke growth. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major peers, edged 0.05% lower to 103.74, after a 0.55% jump overnight that ended a three-day losing streak. The yen slipped, with the dollar adding 0.21% to 128.495 yen after a 0.86% tumble on Wednesday. The Swiss franc continued to strengthen, with the dollar losing a further 0.13% to 0.9869 franc, following a 0.6% slide. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was steady around 2.89% in Tokyo trading after dropping from as high as 3.015% in the prior session.   The pandemic vastly changed the way Americans spend money and now as they return to pre-pandemic behavior, they’re tripping up retailers again. That dynamic has only been intensified in recent months as inflation jumps sharply, and the latest financial report from Target underscores the challenges. Target reported Wednesday that its profit tumbled 52% compared with the same period last year in an environment of rising costs for things like fuel, and also a lightening quick return by consumers to more normalized spending. Purchases of big TVs and appliances that Americans loaded up on during the pandemic have faded, leaving Target with a bloated inventory that must be marked down to sell. Target's quarterly financial report comes a day after shares of rival Walmart tumbled about 17% for similar reasons after it posted quarterly results. Both companies missed profit expectations by a wide margin. Shares of Walmart fell another 8% Wednesday.   Gold prices were flat on Thursday, as an elevated dollar weighed on greenback-priced bullion and countered support from lower Treasury yields, with the metal's outlook already dulled by an aggressive Federal Reserve stance on inflation. * Spot gold held its ground at $1,816.63 per ounce at 0047 GMT. U.S. gold futures edged 0.1% lower to $1,814.10. * The U.S. dollar rose on Wednesday, snapping a three-session losing streak, as concerns about the outlook for global economic growth and rapid inflation knocked sentiment a day after Fed Chair Jerome Powell struck a more hawkish tone.   Three weeks after Wells Fargo Investment Institute cut its view on the S&P 500, it did this again, saying a mild recession is now its base-case view. The investment advisory firm slashed its year-end target by 300 points Wednesday, on top of the 200-point cut it made late April. The advisory arm of Wells Fargo & Co. now sees the gauge trading in the 4,200-4,400 range by Christmas. That represents a drop of as much as 7.7% for the full year, but a gain of up to 12% from current levels. “We have noted a growing recession risk since early this year,"" Wells Fargo Investment Institute’s strategists wrote in a note to clients. “As we weigh the latest monthly and weekly data, the economy has crossed a probability level that makes a mild and short-lived recession our base case.""   Hong Kong stocks were down by more than three percent Thursday, after Wall Street suffered one of its worst batterings in two years. The Hang Seng index was down 3.03 percent, or 625.84 points, at 20,018.44.   Yesterday’s massive rally was followed by yet another gap up opening with modest gains. We clearly shrugged off the global cues as the SGX Nifty was indicating a sluggish start in the morning. In the initial trades, Nifty extended its gains towards 16400, but failed to sustain at higher levels. Around the midsession, Key indices pared down all gains and slipped marginally in the red. Fortunately, a smart recovery immediately after the midseason pulled Nifty back to 16350, which again got sold into to conclude the choppy session on a flat note. Since the overall global picture has not changed yet, our market was unable to keep up the same momentum as we witnessed during yesterday’s short covering move. Traders chose to take some money off the table after reaching the key resistance zone of 16400 – 16500. Now although we have seen some sluggish moves today, we expect buying to emerge at lower levels till the time Nifty holds its sacrosanct support zone of 16100 – 16000. Traders can certainly take a punt as close as possible to 16150 – 16100 on the expiry session. On the flipside, it’s advisable to lighten up longs around the higher range of 16400 – 16500. The real strength will come back in our market only after surpassing the sturdy wall of 16500 – 16600, till then it would be a prudent strategy to adopt ‘One step at a time’ strategy. Today, there wasn’t much sectoral participation seen in the market; but the FMCG space stood out and some of the heavyweights like, HINDUNILVR are poised for some decent moves. Also, one can focus on banking and metal counters which are likely to perform well if there is no aberration globally.   Oil prices fell 2.5% on Wednesday, reversing early gains as traders grew less worried about a supply crunch after government data showed U.S. refiners ramped up output, and as crude futures followed Wall Street lower. Brent crude futures for July settled down $2.82, or 2.5%, at $109.11 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for June fell $2.81, or 2.5%, to $109.59 a barrel. Both benchmarks gave up early gains of $2-$3 a barrel following a change in risk sentiment as equity markets fell, said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.   Asian stocks tracked a steep Wall Street selloff on Thursday, as investors fretted over rising global inflation, China's zero-COVID policy and the Ukraine war, while the safe-haven dollar held most of its strong overnight gains. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 2% in early Asian trading hours, the first daily decline in a week. Japan's Nikkei tumbled 2.4%. Pulling it lower was a 1.5% loss for Australia's resource-heavy index, a 2.6% drop in Hong Kong stocks and a 1% retreat for blue chips in mainland China . Overnight on Wall Street, earnings reports from retail giants soured sentiment, with Target Corp warning of a bigger margin hit due to rising fuel and freight costs as it reported its quarterly profit had halved. One day earlier, Walmart Inc warned of similar margin squeezes. Target's shares plunged 24.88%, the biggest one-day percentage drop since the ""Black Monday"" stock market crash on Oct. 19, 1987. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq fall almost 5% while the S&P 500 lost 4%.   A slump in stocks extended into Asia Thursday and US equity futures retreated after mounting fears of an economic downturn hit Wall Street shares and spurred a flight to havens including sovereign bonds. Equities slid in Japan, Australia and South Korea in the wake of a 4% plunge in the S&P 500 index, the biggest daily drop in almost two years, and a more than 5% tumble in the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 index. Earnings reports from consumer stalwarts stoked worries that high inflation is weighing on margins and consumer spending. Target Corp. plunged the most since Black Monday in 1987, a day after Walmart Inc. also spiraled lower. Federal Reserve officials reaffirmed that sharply tighter monetary policy lies ahead to cool economic activity and get price pressures under control. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said raising interest rates somewhat above the neutral level and stopping there should help bring inflation down. Treasuries climbed amid fraying risk appetite. The dollar pared an advance. Bonds in Australia and New Zealand jumped in the slipstream of the US session. China’s Covid lockdowns amid a persistent omicron outbreak are also buffeting markets. Oil sank below $109 a barrel on concerns about demand. The challenge from inflation for bellwether retailers weakens the argument that corporate earnings can help stem this year’s rout in stocks. Instead, global equities are sliding toward a bear market as recession fears mount.  "
Updated: 19 May 2022,"ITC Q4 profit tops expectations on cigarette, FMCG sales growth",https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/itc-q4-profit-tops-expectations-on-cigarette-fmcg-sales-growth-11652900820507.html,"NEW DELHI : ITC Ltd on Wednesday beat Street expectations with a 11.8% rise in March quarter standalone net profit as high revenue from cigarettes and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) offset an increase in expenses. Profit in the three months ended 31 March climbed to ₹4,190.96 crore from ₹3,748.42 crore a year earlier. Revenue from operations grew 16% to ₹16,426 crore from ₹14,156.98 crore during the period. Profit surpassed the ₹4,169 crore estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Revenue also exceeded the ₹14,762 crore estimate. March quarter expenses at the maker of Bingo chips and Gold Flake cigarettes grew 15.7% from a year earlier to ₹11,658.05 crore. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) rose 16.8%. FMCG revenue grew 12.3% during the quarter to ₹4,141.97 crore, while cigarette revenue rose 10% to ₹6,443.37. ITC posted a “broad-based"" recovery in cigarettes despite disruptions because of the third wave of covid with volumes surpassing pre-pandemic levels, it said. “The FMCG businesses, despite an unprecedented increase in prices of key inputs, performed well through focused cost management interventions across the value chain, premiumisation, product mix enrichment, and judicious pricing actions,"" the company said. During FY22, ITC expanded its multi-channel go-to-market strategy while the market and outlet coverage was expanded up to 1.4 times and 1.1 times, respectively. “Direct reach enhancement in rural markets was supported through a hub and spoke distribution model with the expansion of rural stockists network to 1.4 times over the previous year and collaborations with rural-focused eB2B players,"" the company said in its March quarter update. The company launched more than 110 new products across target markets during the year, it said. ITC is setting up a personal care and home care products manufacturing unit in Uluberia, West Bengal, in line with its strategy of building in-house manufacturing capabilities for products with unique formulations, enhancing supply chain agility and responsiveness, and reducing distance to market, the company said. ITC’s March quarter numbers were a “strong show"", said analysts tracking the company. “There was a beat of almost 5 to 6% versus our and consensus estimate. All the key businesses have done well. FMCG business saw decent performance in the current context. Parts of the business that have not done well in the past few years because of covid are essentially the stationery and education segment, which should be able to see a revival in FY 23,"" said Abneesh Roy, executive vice president at Edelweiss Financial Services. Meanwhile, the company’s hotel business made a smart recovery despite the third wave impacting recovery momentum in the first half of the quarter while exit occupancies surpassed pre-pandemic levels. The hotels business reported segment revenue of ₹389.64 crore during the quarter, up 35.3% from a year earlier. The agriculture business segment reported a 29% growth in segment revenue during the quarter. This was driven by strong growth in wheat, rice, spices, and leaf tobacco exports on the back of strong customer relationships, robust sourcing network and agile executions, the company said. Re-opening of educational institutions aided recovery in education and stationery products business though the segment is still below pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, paperboards, paper and packaging segment revenue grew 31.8% from a year earlier in the March quarter. “Paperboard volumes were at record high. There was robust growth aided by demand revival across most end-user segments. The sustainable products portfolio continues to be scaled up,"" the company said."
