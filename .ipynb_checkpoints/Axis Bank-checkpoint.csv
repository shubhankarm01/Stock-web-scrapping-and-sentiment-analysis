This had an effect on the retail loan segment, prompting both new and current loan borrowers to pay higher EMIs. Home loans are now more expensive as a result of the benchmark interest rate increase, and the rates are often significantly higher for borrowers without salaries or those with credit scores below 750. Repo Linked Loan Rate (RLLR) and Marginal Cost of Fund Based Lending Rate (MCLR) hikes are still in progress even after a month of MPC meetings. As a consequence, it is difficult to get a home loan with cheap interest rates currently. However, let's examine the home loan rates being provided by the largest lenders in our nation.  Bank of Baroda (BoB) accepts applications for home loans from Indian residents who are at least 21 years old. Additionally, eligible are non-resident Indians (NRIs) with Indian passports, persons of Indian origin (PIOs) with foreign passports, and overseas citizens of India (OCI). The bank has set a maximum age restriction of 70 years for borrowers who want to get loans, and the maximum loan term is 30 years. The effective interest rate on home loans for non-staff members ranges from 7.45 per cent to 8.80 per cent. While the interest rate that applies to staff members (Public Scheme) is 7.45 per cent.  The minimum interest rate for home loans was raised to 7.55 per cent on June 15, 2022, by SBI, the largest lender in our nation. On the bank's website, it is stated that the lender has also raised its External Benchmark-based Lending Rate (EBLR) from 7.05 per cent to a minimum of 7.55 per cent. With effect from June 15, 2022, SBI has increased the benchmark one-year MCLR rate from 7.20 per cent to 7.40 per cent and updated the marginal cost of fund-based lending rates (MCLR) by up to 0.20 per cent.  Home loans with reasonable interest rates are available from ICICI Bank for terms of up to 30 years. Through ICICI Bank Express Home Loan, a self-service digital platform for current as well as non-ICICI Bank customers, borrowers can obtain digital approval for a home loan. With effect from June 8, 2022, ICICI Bank updated its External Benchmark Lending Rate (EBLR). ""ICICI Bank External Benchmark Lending Rate"" (I-EBLR) is referenced to RBI Policy Repo Rate with a mark-up over Repo Rate. I-EBLR is 8.60% p.a.p.m. effective June 8, 2022,"" the bank has mentioned on its website.  The marginal cost of lending rate, or MCLR, has been raised by the HDFC Bank across all tenors, and the new MCLR rates are effective as of Thursday, July 7. The overnight, one-month, and three-month HDFC Bank MCLR rates were increased by 20 basis points to 7.70%, 7.75%, and 7.80%, respectively. The HDFC Bank MCLR rates have increased by 20 bps to 7.90% and 8.05%, respectively, for tenures of six months and one year. The MCLR for HDFC Bank has increased by 20 bps to 8.15 per cent and 8.25 per cent for terms of two and three years, respectively.  Repo Linked Lending Rate (RLLR) is now 7.40 per cent with effect from September 6,2022, and One Year MCLR Rate is 7.55 per cent at PNB. The home loan interest rates are as follows.  Home loans from Axis Bank start at Rs. 3,00,000 and include a number of benefits including longer-term, appealing interest rates, a simple application procedure, doorstep service, etc. No prepayment fees as well as floating and fixed interest rates are permitted by Axis Bank for home loans. The bank provides a floating rate of 7.60 per cent to 7.95 per cent per year for salaried individuals and a fixed rate of 12 per cent for home loans. The floating rate for individuals who are self-employed ranges from 7.70 per cent to 8.05 per cent annually. and the current fixed rate for loans is 12 per cent."

A gang of robbers reached the Axis Bank ATM, located on the ground floor of a house on GT Road in Chaithi village in Chouparan police station, with gas cutters, LPG cylinders and hammers to rob during the night. The house, where the ATM is located, is owned by one Sudhir Barnwal. The robbers almost finished cutting open the machine, when Barnwal's pet dog Samba began barking, alerting his owner and the neighbours, the agency said citing police's statement. As people woke up, the robbers left the damaged machine behind and fled, the cops said. A case has been filed and an investigation started into the incident, Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Nazir Akhtar said. The ATM had ₹27 lakh in it, he said. Police said they suspect robbers were from outside the state involved in it. Another similar incident happened in Gujarat in 2020 when an alert dog helped foil a burglary in Manjalpur, Vadodara. The police rushed to the spot and arrested a burglar. A local resident said that their pet dog, Rocky made muffled noise and another person living in that area understood that something was wrong. The man said they looked out of the window and saw four burglars trying to break into the house. The man and his son immediately informed the neighbours and hearing the commotion the burglars took off but the local residents followed. The man said his dog Rocky has previously also alerted about the burglary. According to the latest report by RBI, India has the third-largest number of ATMs deployed, it continues to fare poorly with regard to people served per ATM due to its sizeable population. A single ATM catering to over 5,800 people as of the end of 2020. Besides, the cases of burglary, dacoity, robbery, and theft in ATMs have increased in the past few years. As per the RBI, in FY18 the cases of ATM robbery were 303, which increased to 515 in FY19. The amount involved was ₹11.22 crore and ₹25.47 crore, respectively. (With PTI inputs)"

We believe the growth momentum to remain healthy but delays in the investment cycle may impact the overall growth in the near term,"" the note stated. Axis Securities believes with the asset quality pain being largely behind (barring certain segments) and the restructured book behaving fairly well, a ramp-up in credit growth and the ability to maintain margins in an increasing interest rate environment is likely to drive valuations for Banks/NBFCs moving forward.  It has maintained its Equal Weight stance on the banking sector. Its top stock picks are ICICI Bank with target price of ₹1,000, State Bank of India or SBI (TP: ₹665), and Federal Bank Ltd (TP: ₹115) and has Buy recommendations on the bank stocks. “ICICI bank has been outperforming its peers and has been ticking most boxes on growth, margins and asset quality, Higher loan growth, improving operating profits, and a strong provision buffer coupled with a strong deposit franchise will help the bank achieve ROAE/ROAA expansion over FY23-24E. On the valuation front, we believe the bank continues to be on a comfortable footing,"" Axis Securities said. Amongst the PSU banks, SBI remains the best play on the gradual recovery of the Indian economy on account of its healthy PCR, robust capitalization, a strong liability franchise, and an improved asset quality outlook, as per the brokerage. “Key positives for Federal Bank are increasing retail focus, strong fee income, adequate capitalization, and prudent provisioning. We expect steady provision requirements along with healthy growth in the balance sheet,"" it added.

However, post-expiry a sharp downside movement in the Sensex heavyweight Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) shares led to dip in the 50-stock index towards 15,500 levels. But, except oil and gas, the other sectors performed well and hence, the index recovered from the lows to end around 15,750 with a marginal loss. Asian markets struggled again on Friday following another selloff on Wall Street fueled by recession fears. European equities were steady on Friday after two days of declines as investors look ahead to a busy month of earnings amid concerns over a slowing economy. According to stock market experts, a small negative candle was formed on the daily chart with a long lower shadow. Technically, this pattern indicates the formation of the hammer-type pattern (not a classical one). Such market action signals a short-term bottom reversal pattern for the market. This could also indicate a false downside breakout of the small range at 15,700 levels. This is a positive indication, and one may expect further upside in the short term. Day trading guide for stock market today Speaking on day trading guide for Nifty today, Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said, ""The short-term trend of Nifty continues to be range bound. But Friday's sharp upside recovery from the lows hints at the possibility of more upside for the market ahead. A sustainable upside move only above 15,900 to 15,950 levels could bring bulls back into the market and that could possibly pull the Nifty towards the next upside levels of 16,200 to 16,300 levels quickly. Immediate support for NSE Nifty is placed at 15,630 levels."" Day trading stocks           "

Research Analysts at ICICI Securities in their note said, SBIC’s improved marginally to 18.7% in May’22, up 9 basis points MoM. SBIC’s FY22 spends market share stood at 19%. HDFC Bank’s market share also improved 11.3 basis points MoM to 27.7%.

Updated: 30 Jun 2022,"Sensex ends flat, Nifty below 15,800; Axis Bank, SBI up, TechM, Bajaj twins drag",https://www.livemint.com/market/live-blog/share-market-live-updates-sensex-nifty-bse-nse-stock-market-today-30-06-2022-minda-infosys-tvs-motors-biocon-11656552459047.html,"Indian indices on Thursday slipped into the red zone after tracking weak global trends as inflation and recession fears kept investors on the edge. With today's loss, the indices recorded their worst quarter since the pandemic began. The investors fear the central bank could take some aggressive steps to curb inflation which could further hurt the economy. Globally, stock markets declined on Thursday after the US economy contracted, fuelling fears of a worldwide downturn. Shares fell in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, and South Korea, while it rose in Shanghai.  Indian indices on Thursday slipped marginally into the red, tracking weakness in global indices. The Sensex slipped 8.03 points, or 0.02%, to close at 53,018.94, while Nifty50 declined 18.85 points to end at 15,780.25. Sectorally, auto, realty and metals performed badly, while banks defied the trend to end in the green. On the 30-stock index, Axis Bank, SBI, and Kotak Bank were the top performers, while TechM, Tata Steel, and Bajaj twins were among the biggest losers. On the Nifty50 index, Axis Bank, SBI, Divi's Lab registered the biggest gains, while Eicher Motors, Cipla, and BPCL were the biggest laggards.   Global stock markets declined Thursday after the U.S. economy contracted, fueling fears of a worldwide downturn. London and Frankfurt opened lower. Tokyo and Hong Kong declined while Shanghai gained. The future for Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 index was down 1.1% after data Wednesday showed the U.S. economy shrank in the first quarter amid high inflation and weakening consumer confidence. Investors are uneasy about signs the biggest global economy might be in a recession due to interest rate hikes imposed to cool surging inflation.   Oil prices were largely steady in volatile trading on Thursday as the market weighed concerns over global supply against a build in U.S. fuel product inventories. Brent crude futures for September, the more actively traded contract, were up 28 cents, or 0.3%, at $112.73 a barrel by 0911 GMT. The August contract, which expires on Thursday, was down 11 cents, or 0.1%, at $116.15. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 20 cents, or 0.2%, to $109.98. Crude inventories fell by 2.8 million barrels in the week to June 24, U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed, far exceeding the 569,000 barrel drop forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.   Gold was mostly quiet on Thursday, but faced its worst quarter since early 2021 as a remarkable showing from the dollar kept investors away, with bullion's outlook clouded by top central banks adopting aggressive tactics to fight stubborn inflation. Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1,814.96 per ounce, as of 0754 GMT. U.S. gold futures dipped 0.1% to $1,815.50. Gold prices, set to drop for a third straight month, have fallen about 6.4% this quarter.   The fear of recession in the US amid the aggressive rate hike by Federal reserve to tame the inflation keep the equity market on edge. If there is recession in the US as per the expectation then it could be felt in India as well. In stagflation where the demand is low and inflation is high, the small companies find it difficult to sustain its business momentum as they have less pricing power compared to large scale companies. Large cap companies are well placed to weather such economic downturn with their healthy balance sheet, strong brand proposition and better pricing power. Hence, in a turbulent market it is better to stay invested in large cap companies having strong fundamentals, good business moat and strong industry tailwind.   India's telecom giants are likely to make muted bids at the 5G spectrum auction in July, on worries they stand to lose about 40% in potential revenues due to the allotment of some airwaves to enterprises for private networks, industry sources said. Top player Reliance Industries' Jio and rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have failed to lobby New Delhi to stop the allocation that will let various enterprises, including Amazon.com and Tata Consultancy Services, to get airwaves without auction. ""The telecom companies are quite upset, there will be an estimated 40% potential 5G revenue loss,"" said S.P. Kochhar, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India, which represents the three telcos.   Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said India's micro, small and medium enterprises are a huge pillar of growth journey, as they together account for almost one-third of the country's economy. ""When we say MSME, it expands in technical language to Micro Small and Medium Enterprises. But these micro, small and medium enterprises are a huge pillar of India's growth journey. MSME sector accounts for almost one-third of India's economy,"" PM Modi said. The Prime Minister made the remarks while inaugurating the ₹6,062.45-crore 'Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance' (RAMP) scheme for MSMEs at the 'Udyami Bharat' programme held at Vigyan Bhawan in the national capital. The said scheme aims to scale up the implementation capacity and coverage of MSMEs in the states, with impact enhancement of existing schemes. The scheme has outlay of around ₹6,000 crore.   Most markets fell again Thursday as traders fear that hefty rate hikes to rein in soaring inflation will spark a recession, though a slight improvement in Chinese data provided a little cheer. The rally enjoyed across the world last week appears to have given way to nervousness about the economic outlook, while the Ukraine war continues to sow uncertainty. The surge in inflation to multi-decade highs has forced central banks to swiftly tighten pandemic-era monetary policies, dealing a hefty blow to equities, particularly tech firms who are susceptible to higher borrowing costs. The Federal Reserve has already sharply lifted rates and is expected to announce a second successive 75-basis-point lift next month.   allied producing nations may not be much help as they decide Thursday how much more crude to send to world markets. That's because the 23-member OPEC+ alliance, which includes Russia, is struggling to produce enough oil to keep up with the rebounding demand for fuel since the COVID-19 pandemic. Plus, Western buyers are shunning barrels from Russia over its war in Ukraine, meaning there’s less oil on the market to go around. OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and its allies will decide whether to boost production in August beyond the increase of 648,000 barrels per day that the group agreed to at its last meeting. That boost was a modest step at providing some relief to soaring prices. Before, OPEC+ had been adding about 432,000 barrels per day monthly to put oil back on the market after cutting production dramatically during the height of the pandemic.   Sebi has barred Parsvnath Developers from the securities market for six months and imposed a penalty of ₹15 lakh on the company for flouting listing rules. The company has been directed to pay the fine within 45 days, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in an order. Sebi found that Parsvnath Developers Ltd (PDL) failed to make provision for the outstanding amount in ledger accounts of contractors and sub-contractors and also failed to strictly comply with Accounting Standards 7 or AS 7, which deals with construction contracts.   European shares on Thursday looked set for their worst quarter since the pandemic-led carnage in early 2020, as investors became increasingly wary of a global recession in the wake of hawkish central bank actions to tame rapid inflation. The continent-wide STOXX 600 index dropped 1.3%, setting it up for quarterly losses of more than 10%. France's CAC 40 index slid 1.8% as preliminary official figures showed inflation climbed further from the previous month to a record 6.5%. ""What we're seeing at the moment is more evidence that inflation is serious, entrenched and investors are having to now reappraise the valuations they are putting on equities,"" said Azad Zangana­, senior European economist and strategist at Schroders. ""Now for a little while, the attitude in Europe was well a lot of the inflation is external. That's changing now and over the next few months, the European Central Bank will have to step up its efforts to curb inflation over the next few years."" The STOXX 600 fell for a second straight day after global central bank chiefs said bringing down high inflation around the world will be painful and could even crash growth. All eyes are now on the first estimate of June inflation for the euro zone due on Friday, which the ECB should scrutinize ahead of its July 21 policy meeting where it promised to hike rates for the first time since 2011.   Domestic brokerage and research firm Prabhudas Lilladher is bullish on Rallis India shares and has upgraded the chemical stock's rating to ‘Buy’, given its recent correction in the stock price and has a target price of ₹230.   B Right Real Estate IPO: The initial public offer (IPO) of B Right Real Estate Limited has opened for subscription today and the BSE SME public issue worth ₹44.36 crore will remain open for bidding till 5th July 2022. The real estate company has fixed B Right Real Estate IPO price band at ₹153 per equity share and one lot of the IPO will comprise 800 shares of the company.   Rating: BUY | CMP: Rs187 | TP: Rs230 We trim our FY23/24E EPS estimates by 16%/15% citing pressure on near term margins and upgrade the rating to ‘BUY’ from HOLD with revised TP of Rs230 (Rs260 earlier) based on 18xFY24 EPS. Management stated that recent correction in RM prices coupled with high cost inventory will exert pressures on 1HFY23 margins. However, 4-5% price hikes (as compared to Mar-22 levels) will help to partially mitigate the same. Rallis India (RALI) in its first ever pre-quarterly conference call highlighted that (a) domestic crop care and seeds segment will likely post stable performance in 1QFY23, placements have progressed as per plan and liquidation will take place in subsequent quarters; (b) delayed monsoons do have an impact in terms of placements and liquidation, while some crop shift patterns are visible in cotton and paddy crops; (c) exports will likely grow better than other segments (lower base of last year -8% YoY to aid growth); (d) pressure on margins likely to persist in near term, however, remains confident to maintain absolute EBITDA; (e) price hikes taken to the tune of 4-5% as compared to March’22 levels to mitigate inflated RM cost; and (f) capex plans are on schedule. We expect revenue/PAT CAGR of 10%/4% over FY22-24E (vs 8%/3% over FY11-22). Upgrade to ‘BUY’ given recent correction in stock price (down >30%).   Drugmaker Biocon Ltd has engaged an external law firm to do a comprehensive review of its governance processes involving consultants and vendors following the CBI making a few arrests over alleged bribes paid to a government drugs controller. Sources with knowledge of the matter said the review is part of the management's reiteration of its commitment to strengthening compliance and governance practices across Biocon group entities. The company already has a strong code of conduct and an anti-bribery corruption clause in its contracts with all its vendors.   Shares of Ratnamani Metals and Tubes Ltd jumped to hit a 52-week high level of ₹1,920 apiece on the BSE in Thursday's early deals as the stock started trading ex-bonus, a day ahead of its record date for the bonus shares issue.   JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals on Thursday said its board has approved a proposal to acquire four paediatric brands from Dr Reddy's Laboratories for about ₹98 crore.

US Treasury yields eased for a second consecutive day and the dollar rose on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said there is a risk the US central bank's interest rate hikes will slow the economy too much, but the bigger risk is persistent inflation. The S&P 500 ended slightly lower, and looked set to put in the worst first-half for the US benchmark index in more than five decades. ""The clock is kind of running on how long will you remain in a low-inflation regime. ... The risk is that because of the multiplicity of shocks you start to transition into a higher inflation regime and our job is to literally prevent that from happening and we will prevent that from happening,"" Powell said at a European Central Bank conference.

Both contracts rose more than 2% on Tuesday as concerns over tight supplies due to Western sanctions on Russia outweighed fears of that demand may slow in a potential future recession.   Copper prices slipped on Wednesday, as downbeat U.S. consumer confidence data and prospects of rapid rate hikes to control a surge in inflation fanned fears of a global economic slowdown, impacting metals demand. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was down 0.6% at $8,314 a tonne, as of 0702 GMT. Prices of the metal, which is used as a gauge of economic health by investors, has fallen 23% since scaling a peak of $10,845 in March.

We tweak our FY23/24E earnings lower by ~1%. IGL reported strong results with EBIDTA/PAT of Rs5.0bn (6%Q/Q; PLe Rs3.9bn) and Rs3.6bn (16%Q/Q; PLe Rs2.7bn), due to higher margins given lower spot purchase. Volumes were lower QoQ partly due to pandemic restrictions in January and were at 7.7mscmd (-1%Q/Q). For FY22, EBIDTA/PAT was at Rs18.8bn (+11% 2yr CAGR) and Rs13.1bn (2yr CAGR 7.7%). We believe pick-up in economic activity will drive growth in coming quarters. IGL remains an enviable business model with high volume growth due to geographical expansion and addition of new buses and taxis. Also, fuel economics, shift to private vehicle ownership post pandemic will drive CNG volumes despite excise duty cuts, in our view. Reiterate “BUY"" with DCF-based PT of Rs589 (Rs662) as we raise the WACC to 10.3% from 9.7%.   “NYMEX crude trades marginally lower near $111/bbl after recovering nearly 10% from recent lows. Crude oil rose in last few days on supply concerns as G7 members worked on ways to cap Russian crude prices, Libya and Ecuador faced supply disruptions due to political issues and as some major producers like UAE indicated that they were producing near capacity. The momentum is crude oil however came to a halt as disappointing US economic data rekindled demand concerns and as market players positioned for weekly inventory report. Crude may remain choppy ahead of inventory report however lack of any positive surprise may result in some profit taking.""   “COMEX gold trades in a range near $1820/oz as support from disappointing US economic data, ban on Russian gold imports by some G7 countries, sharp rebound in crude oil price and improving outlook for Chinese economy is countered by rebound in US dollar index, attempts at recovery by equity markets, continuing ETF outflows and monetary tightening stance of major central banks. Gold remains stuck in the $1800-1850/oz and this may continue amid lack of fresh triggers however with Fed’s emphasis on aggressive tightening, the US dollar may remain supported keeping pressure on gold prices..""   We downgrade MM to HOLD with revised DCF-based target price of Rs1,150 (earlier: Rs1,065), implying 15x FY24E core earnings and discounted value of stake in various listed entities. Under present business visibility, we see limited scope for further earnings upgrades, resulting in limited upside on present valuation levels, post MM having given ~60% return in past three months.   IRCTC share price: Shares of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation rally took a pause today after surging on last three successive sessions.

Japan's Nikkei index fell 0.98%, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.37%, dragged lower by Australian shares, off 0.81%, and Korea's KOSPI, down 1.54%. Asian shares had ended the Tuesday session on an upward trajectory after China announced an easing of its quarantine requirements for inbound passengers, in what some observers saw as the biggest relaxation so far of its ""zero COVID"" strategy. But the positive impact had petered out on Wednesday. ""Inevitably, markets tend to overreact to these sorts of news,"" said Carlos Casanova, senior economist at UBP in Hong Kong.

EUROSTOXX 50 futures were down 0.57% and FTSE futures lost 0.68% before European markets opened. The losses in Asia followed a turbulent day on US markets, with the S&P 500 index down more than 2% after data showed US consumer confidence dropped to a 16-month low in June due to fears high inflation could cause the economy to slow significantly in the second half of the year.   Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani stepped down on Tuesday from the role of director of the telecoms arm of Reliance Industries in favour of his son Akash, setting the stage for a leadership transition at his energy-to-retail conglomerate. The change was disclosed in a regulatory filing by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which said Mukesh's 30-year-old son and non-executive director Akash was being appointed chairman of the board. The move comes after Ambani, who ranks among the world's top 10 billionaires, first signaled last year that his children would have significant roles in the family's business empire. Reliance is ""in the process of effecting a momentous leadership transition,"" he said at an event in December. Akash's twin sister Isha is a director on the boards of Jio as well as Reliance Retail, which houses the conglomerate's ambitious bets in India's brick-and-mortar space. The youngest of the siblings, Anant, sits on the board of renewable energy and oil and chemical units of Reliance as a director.   We re-iterate BUY on Century Plyboards (CPBI) as demand continues to remain healthy for wood panel products. Our recent interaction with dealers and the management of Century Plyboards (CPBI) indicates that in the currently ongoing Q1FY23, demand trends are steady across segments like plywood, laminates and MDF on continued pick-up in residential market and higher spend on home improvement post the pandemic. CPBI has taken price increase of ~2-4% in plywood segment and ~3-4% in laminates during Q1FY23, which should enable it to mitigate the raw material price pressures and thus, enable margin to remain steady going ahead. CPBI management had earlier guided for 15-25% revenue growth across segments in FY23. We maintain estimates and our BUY rating on the stock with an unchanged Mar’23E target price of Rs747.   We reiterate our BUY ratings on Indian Hotels Co. Ltd. (IHCL) and Lemon Tree Hotels (LTH). For IHCL, we have a target price of Rs284/share, valuing the stock at 22x Jun’24E EV/EBITDA.

Shares of Century Plyboards India Ltd have been under pressure recently, after scaling a new 52-week high of ₹749 in March.

So far in this calendar year, the stock has corrected by around 15% on the National Stock Exchange.   After the G-7 leaders agreed to curb Russian oil imports to limit the energy proceeds that Kremlin uses to finance its war machines in Ukraine the country's fuel prices have gone up due to strong demand from Asia. But should India be worried?   Domestic brokerage and research firm IIFL has retained its positive stance on Deepak Fertilisers shares, as at 10x FY23ii P/E, it continues to find valuations attractive. While nitric-acid realisations and spreads are expected to sustain in FY23, TAN spreads may soften. Thus, EPS growth in FY23 is expected to be muted, the brokerage highlighted in a note.   Traders in India’s foreign-exchange market are bracing for more instances of dollar shortages, as record outflows from the nation’s equities and deteriorating external finances bite. Some Mumbai-based banks saw a dollar crunch last week, as outflows from Indian assets add to the pressure, according to Mizuho Bank Ltd. and IFA Global. The rupee dropped to a record low against the greenback on Wednesday. Foreign investors have pulled $28 billion from Indian equities this year, while higher oil import costs and a widening current account deficit mean that everybody from investors to companies are demanding dollar for their rupee at the same time. The Reserve Bank of India said last Friday it’s trying to meet the demand through its reserves.   Rakesh Jhunjhunwala portfolio: After climbing to life-time high of ₹268.95 on NSE in April 2022, Indian Hotels Company shares are under base building phase. However, the stock has a history of giving strong return to its shareholders in long term.

Stock market of India has been under sell-off heat after the outbreak of Russia-Ukraine war. In YTD time, both Nifty and Sensex have corrected more than 10 per cent whereas small-cap index has corrected over 16 per cent in 2022. So, positional investors looking for value picks available at discounted price may get lured towards small-cap stocks for higher returns when the market rebounds.   Domestic equity indices declined substantially in the opening session of Wednesday due to consistent depreciation of rupee, foreign fund outflows, prevailing inflation concerns, among others. Indian currency rupee has been consistently hitting fresh all-time lows. The renewed rise in global crude oil prices too have a negative bearing on the market sentiments, said analysts. On Tuesday, the indices closed steady, while they have declined during the majority of the sessions so far in June. At 10.00 a.m on Wednesday, Sensex was at 52,844.78 points, down 332.67 points or 0.63%, whereas Nifty at 15,749.35 points, down 100.85 points or 0.64%.   The Indian rupee weakened further on Wednesday, touching record lows against the U.S. dollar as losses in domestic shares and other Asian currencies weighed on sentiment. The partially convertible rupee was trading at 78.94/95 per dollar by 0409 GMT, after touching a lifetime low of 78.95. The currency closed at 78.77 on Tuesday. Traders said the rupee could weaken towards 79 per dollar during the session, but the central bank is expected to intervene to slow the slide in the currency.   2Wheeler stocks have outperformed Nifty by 11-33% since Feb 2022 . However, stocks have still lagged Nifty by 33-77% since Jan 2018 due to demand downturn and EV concern. While the latter concern will continue until clarity on EV market shares emerges, Jefferies believes stocks are attractive for the impending demand recovery.

An Asian equity index snapped a four-day climb, shedding more than 1%. US futures steadied after a tech-led tumble in the S&P 500 on Tuesday. Institutional portfolio rebalancing may be impacting trading. China’s bourses were in the red too but the losses were relatively modest.

That hinted at an eventual shift away from a strategy of stamping out Covid that involves great economic cost via lockdowns and travel curbs.   A total of two stocks have been put under the ban for trade on Wednesday, June 29, 2022 under the futures and options (F&O) segment by the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

During the session, the rupee touched an all-time low of 78.8550 against the American currency.   The dollar climbed on Tuesday while the euro faltered after European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde offered no fresh insight into the central bank's policy outlook. The ECB is widely expected to follow its global peers by raising interest rates in July to try to check soaring inflation though economists are divided on the magnitude of any rate hike. The euro held below $1.06 after Lagarde said the central bank would move gradually but with the option to act decisively on any deterioration in medium-term inflation, especially if there were signs of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations.

Should you buy?,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/axis-securities-sees-55-upside-in-dcb-bank-shares-should-you-buy-11655881112766.html,"DCB share price has been in base building phase since beginning of June 2022. However, the banking stock has given some upside for last few sessions and Axis Bank Securities believe that the banking share may continue to attract buyers' interest on every fall in long term. The brokerage report says that DCB share price may go up to ₹115 apiece levels. DCB share price today is around ₹75 that means the brokerage is expecting around 55 per cent rise in this banking scrip. Speaking on DCB Bank share price outlook, the brokerage said, ""Despite operating primarily in the self-employed segment, DCB has been able to manage the asset quality stress fairly well. The collections have held up well and with the trend likely to sustain, the secured nature of the bank’s restructured book hints at credit costs moderating going forward. The positive trends in terms of a strong recovery pipeline and moderation in slippages will aid in asset quality improvement. With asset quality stress and credit costs having peaked out, the balance sheet growth and improving return ratios should drive valuations for DCB."" Highlighting upon the key financial performance of DCB Bank, Axis Securities research report says, ""The bank’s focus on maintaining asset quality and improving collections along with its cautious approach to growth slowed down its disbursements, and consequently growth. However, with macros normalizing, DCB picked up momentum in terms of both advances and deposits. NII growth remained tepid at 6% YoY owing to higher slippages and excess liquidity weighing on yields. However, it was partially offset by a 46bps improvement in CoF owing to a benign interest rate environment. Thus, NIMs remained largely stable at 3.56% in FY22, which were further supported by higher recoveries in Q4FY22. While fee income growth remained healthy at 22% YoY, lower treasury income dented non-interest income which remained flattish YoY."" On suggestion to positional investors in regard to DCB Bank shares, Axis Securities said, ""We retain our estimates and maintain our BUY recommendation on the stock with a target price of ₹115/share.""

A savings account is required for all banking and financial operations, and it is especially useful for short-term requirements or to meet unexpected crises. Not only can you make withdrawals to suit your needs, but you can also earn better interest rates on your deposits than you can with a current account, so it's a good idea to surf around for the best rates before establishing a savings account. Considering interest rates are on the rise after the repo rate recently raised to 4.90 per cent, here are some banks that have recently adjusted their savings account interest rates that may be worth checking into if you're seeking to create a new account.  On 1st June 2022, Axis Bank made an interest rate revision on savings accounts. Now the bank offers a maximum rate of 3.50% per annum on saving bank deposits. “Effective 1st June, 2022, the interest on your Savings Account has been revised as per the following interest rate structure,"" Axis Bank has mentioned on its website.  On 9th June 2022, Federal Bank revised interest rates on savings accounts. “As the interest rates are linked to Repo rates, the interest rates will change as and when the Repo Rate gets revised by RBI on a T+1 basis,"" Federal Bank has mentioned on its website.  Kotak Mahindra Bank revised its savings account interest rates on 13th June 2022 and following the revision the bank now offers a maximum rate of 4% on savings bank deposits.  Bank of Baroda revised savings account interest rates on 15th June 2022 and savings account holders of the bank will now get a maximum interest rate of 3.35% per annum.  On 1st June 2022, IDFC First Bank revised savings account interest rates and currently the bank offers a maximum interest rate of 6% on savings bank deposits.  Union Bank of India revised savings account interest rates on 16th June 2022 and following the revision the bank is now offering a maximum return of 3.55 % per annum.  On Resident, NRE and NRO savings bank accounts, DCB Bank offers a maximum interest rate of 6.75%. W.e.f. 19th May 2022, the below-listed savings account interest rates of DCB Bank are in force."
Updated: 18 Jun 2022,Moody's upgrades baseline credit assessment of these banks,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/moodys-upgrades-baseline-credit-assessments-of-these-banks-11655535378247.html,"Moody's Investors Service on 17 June upgraded the baseline credit assessments (BCAs) of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank to baa3 from ba1, reflecting improvements in credit fundamentals, particularly asset quality. The upgrade of the BCAs does not result in any change in the deposit ratings because these are already at the same level as the India sovereign rating (Baa3 stable), the global rating agency said. ""The upgrade of the two banks' BCAs is driven by improvements in asset quality, capital, and profitability. Their asset quality has seen a significant improvement, with both the gross and net non-performing loans (NPL) ratios declining. ""Credit costs have also reduced at the same time as provision coverage has increased. Lower credit costs have resulted in higher profitability,"" it said. ICICI Bank and Axis Bank's return on assets for the year ending March 2022 was 1.8 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively, compared to an average of 0.8 per cent and 0.4 per cent over the four years ending March 2020, it said. ICICI Bank's profitability has also benefited from rising net interest margins as the share of the low margin international business has come down in the last four years, it added. Both lenders have raised equity capital, resulting in significantly higher capital ratios, it said, adding the core equity tier 1 ratios of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank at end March 2022 were 17.6 per cent and 15.2 per cent respectively, compared to 13.6 per cent and 11.3 per cent at end March 2019. However, it said, Axis Bank's proposed acquisition of Citigroup Inc's India consumer assets will result in an approximately 230 bps decline in capital at the bank. As Axis Bank has good access to capital markets, the ratings agency expects the bank to raise capital to maintain its current capital ratios. Axis Bank is targeting to close the acquisition by March 2023.  (With inputs from PTI)"

The IDRs are based on Fitch's assessment of high to moderate probability of extraordinary state support for these banks, which takes into account its assessment of the sovereign's ability and propensity to provide extraordinary support.

Separately, Fitch also revised the outlook on Export-Import Bank of India's (EXIM) Long-Term IDR to stable from negative. These rating actions follow Fitch's revision of the outlook on the 'BBB-' rating on India to stable from negative last week due to diminished downside risks to the country's medium-term growth, which is underscored by its rapid economic recovery and easing financial sector weaknesses.

Updated: 04 Jun 2022,Large credit card issuers see decline in spending in April,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/large-credit-card-issuers-see-decline-in-spending-in-april-11654279306859.html,"Leading credit card issuers such as SBI Card, Citi India and Axis Bank reported a sequential drop in customer spending in April, data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) showed. Industry experts, however, termed it as more of a seasonal shift instead of an overall weakness in consumer sentiment. They said customers tend to go slow in credit card spending during the first half of a fiscal year, which rebounds in the second half, aided by the festive season. While aggregate spending declined 1.5% to ₹1.05 trillion in April, when compared with March, some issuers saw a steeper fall. For some issuers, the decline in spending—online and offline—in April was more than the system average in the same period. For instance, spending on Citi India credit cards dropped about 3% in April, even though the bank has been able to arrest the ongoing decline in outstanding cards. Between March and April, it lost close to 600 cards. Citi’s outstanding credit cards shrunk by 71,008 to 2.5 million credit cards as of April end since it announced plans to exit India in April last year. This March, Axis Bank announced the acquisition of Citibank’s consumer business in India for ₹12,325 crore ($1.6 billion). The consumer business comprises credit cards, retail banking, and wealth management divisions. The deal is expected to close within a year, although the entire integration process will take another 18 months after regulatory approvals. Industry experts said the drop in spending for Citi could be because many users might have stopped using the card at this juncture, unaware of what would happen to the reward points they accumulate. “People do not know how the conversion is going to be when these cards are transitioned from Citi to Axis Bank. Typically, a Citi India credit cardholder would have other credit cards as well, and some of them might have shifted their high-ticket spends to those cards,"" said Parijat Garg, an independent fintech expert. Meanwhile, spending on Axis Bank credit cards declined 2.2% on a sequential basis in April, and SBI Card recorded a 4% decline during the month. Mint reported in April that the credit card industry is faced with the challenge of getting customers whose dues were restructured under a central bank regulation to start using their cards. Rama Mohan Rao Amara, managing director and chief executive, SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd, told analysts in April that a lot of these retail customers with recast loans were revolvers, and their reluctance to spend has impacted the industry. “Most card issuers have seen a decline in spending in April, as compared to March. For Citi, I think since they are not growing the card base, the spends are automatically shrinking and appears more than the average because everybody else in the market is expanding,"" said a financial sector analyst on condition of anonymity."

Since the short term trend has now changed to sideways, the next directional move will now depend on a breakout beyond the mentioned range and hence, traders should look for either side breakout in the coming week.
