Updated: 26 May 2021,ICICI Prulife’s steady climb in valuations may sustain on growth efforts,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/icici-prulife-s-steady-climb-in-valuations-may-sustain-on-growth-efforts-11622010595264.html,"MUMBAI: Investors of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Ltd have had a lot to cheer for over the past few months and gains in the company's shares reflect this. As such, analysts have noted the modest valuations and held to their buy ratings on the stock. The insurance company added 110 new partners in the March quarter to boost business growth. Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd point out that the company may benefit immensely from its bancassurance partners. But there is another, albeit smaller, push that could benefit ICICI Prulife’s growth. Its banking partners have also grown their deposit base sharply. In fact, deposit growth for banks have been faster in the March quarter. With deposits coming in droves, banks have begun to cut deposit rates. Jefferies points out that this may redirect funds into traditional insurance plans. “Even as the cut in deposit rates primarily reflects the strengthening of their deposit franchise, we believe that it will have a positive rub-off for cross-sell of financial products, especially where returns are guaranteed (like non-par products and annuities) as well as other traditional products like PAR,"" said a note from the brokerage. ICICI Prulife’s bancassurance partners too have announced deposit rate cuts. Considering that they hawk the life insurer’s products, the drop in their deposit rates and the availability of insurance plans on the counter could direct flows into these plans easily. “We understand that these platforms collectively had originated about Rs6-7 billion ( ₹600-700 crore) of annualised new premiums over past year and targets would be to double this in the next 3 years or so, with ICICI Pru Life being a key beneficiary,"" the Jefferies note points out. The bancasurrance channel contributed 42% of the insurer’s annualised premium equivalent (APE) in FY21 and remains the strongest distribution channel. ICICI Prulife has had a tough two years when the company saw its business growth plummet. The pandemic had increased challenges with APE showing a contraction of 12% in FY21. However, the company’s efforts to regain growth has have been appreciated by investors. The fact that its shares trade at a far lower valuation multiple compared with its peers HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd and SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd also works in its favour. The stock trades at a multiple of 2.3 times its estimated embedded value for FY22, cheaper than the multiple of 4.3 for HDFC Life and 2.5 for SBI Life."
Updated: 03 Mar 2021,SBI Life’s optimism to get tested in FY22 as LIC’s IPO looms large,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/fy22-to-test-sbi-life-s-optimism-as-lic-s-listing-looms-11614770478858.html,"India’s private life insurance firms have managed to weather the pandemic, making good the loss of business during the lockdown. The largest life insurer, SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd, too, has shown a sharp recovery and investors have taken note of this. Business growth is crucial for life insurers because it is the bedrock of future profits. The company’s management is optimistic that it would end the year on a growth note despite the massive hit on business in the April-June quarter. Analysts have pegged the FY21 business growth to be around 5% on an annualized premium equivalent basis. With much of the year already gone by, the focus now has rightly shifted to the next financial year. The question now is whether SBI Life will not just sustain but also show a significant boost in growth for FY22. Also Read | How citizen data led India’s covid battle The life insurer has launched new products during the year, increased its focus on simple protection plans and has utilized the vast network of its parent, State Bank of India, to a great extent. The last parameter is a strength that analysts have often highlighted. However, the access to SBI’s network has always been there and SBI Life has been able to use less than 2% of SBI’s customer pool, said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd. This untapped potential and the tie-ups with other public sector banks augur well for growth prospects in the coming years. Given that proprietary channels were hit during the lockdown, the life insurer has seen a sharp rise in its digital sales. This is a good sign for growth. That said, bancassurance channel contributes the lion’s share in premiums. SBI accounted for 60% of the premiums in the nine months ended December. Even as growth comes back, SBI Life’s profitability metrics showed an improvement, too. The value of new business grew 13%, not a mean feat during a pandemic. Covid has made Indians more willing to buy life insurance and that seems to have worked in favour of life insurance companies. However, SBI Life’s shares have not made big gains so far this year compared to peers and its growth numbers did not excite investors. There is one other aspect that investors need to focus on. Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC), the largest player in the country, may get listed in FY22. The government has reiterated its intention to list LIC through an initial public offering. Of course, this is a threat to all listed private life insurers. However, SBI Life could be hit harder than others because there is overlap between its target client base and that of LIC. “We will watch for any impact of aggressive sales push by LIC, which may have higher overlap with the targeted segments and markets of SBI Life,"" wrote analysts at Jefferies in a note. In FY22, SBI Life must not only deliver high growth but also guard against the insurance behemoth in market share."

Updated: 10 Sep 2020,Investors choose HDFC Life over peers but valuations cause worry,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/why-investors-seem-to-prefer-hdfc-life-among-life-insurers-11599734518910.html,"Shares of HDFC Life Insurance Ltd have recovered smartly since the lockdown was lifted, and are now only 5% lower compared to the pre-covid highs. This compares with a 15-16% drop in shares of other private life insurers such as SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Ltd. What is behind the warmth of investors towards HDFC Life Insurance? To begin with, the private sector life insurer was on a strong footing even before the covid-19 pandemic hit in late March. The company’s FY20 performance was superior to its peers. Profitability indicators, such as value of new business growth and value of new business margin, trumped competitors consistently. For instance, HDFC Life’s value of new business margin was 25.9% for FY20 as against 18.7% for SBI Life and 21.7% for ICICI Prudential Life. Performance for the June quarter showed the impact of the lockdown. But HDFC Life managed to keep profitability metrics from eroding too much. Despite a 33% contraction in new business premium, the insurer kept its margins at 24.1%. Peers ICICI Prudential Life and SBI Life saw a sharper contraction in new business. To be sure, data from the sector regulator shows that HDFC Life has fared far better than peers in recovering from the pandemic’s blow.  The bounce back in new business premium in July and August has resulted in narrowing the decline in business for HDFC Life. On an annualized premium equivalent (APE) basis, the contraction in HDFC Life’s business was just 5% for the first five months of FY21. For SBI Life, the contraction was 19% and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance saw a decline of 40%. While it may seem to justify the valuations, some analysts said the shares may have turned pricey. Edelweiss Securities has kept its rating of reduce on the stock. “Valuations at 4.4 times price to embedded value for FY22 are due to a legacy of higher margin/growth compared to competition, along with brand benefits,"" wrote Edelweiss analysts in a note. A big concern for analysts is the potential moderation in the protection business, which has been a large contributor to margins for HDFC Life. Kotak Institutional Equities has said the increase in ratio of sum-assured to premium payout and the rise in average ticket size indicate that growth in simple term plans may be moderating, relative to that of other traditional products. This is a trend observed for most private sector insurers, but HDFC Life has been at the forefront of pushing protection plans. Besides, even those protection plans bundled with loans may see weak demand, analysts added. Since the protection plans are margin-friendly, this could weigh on them. Nevertheless, HDFC Life’s sustained recovery is its best ally in keeping investors interested. So far, the insurer has given little reason to doubt its revival trajectory."

The Nifty 50 was down 1.7% at 11836.25 points. “There is fear among investors that if a lot of people choose the new income tax regime, all these deductions will go. Many tax payers would use life insurance policies and ULIPS (unit-linked insurance plans) to fill their quota of deductions. This may not apply anymore,"" an official at a domestic brokerage house said, adding that even under the old tax regime, it seems about 70 deductions will no longer be allowed. Two other factors that could weigh on life insurance companies’ stocks could be a decline in the broader market and the proposal of Life Insurance Corporation of India’s initial public offering made today. Shares of general insurance companies, though weak, were in line with the decline in the benchmark index. Traders felt it was unlikely the government would do away with deductions for health insurance policies, while most general insurance policies are anyway not covered under these deductions, the official said.
