Updated: 04 Jul 2022,‘SBI to use analytics to track emerging stress across sectors’,https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/sbi-to-use-analytics-to-track-emerging-stress-across-sectors-11656874227527.html,"MUMBAI : State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender, wants to use granular data generated in its branches every day to predict stress and pre-emptively act to shield its balance sheet. Accordingly, the state-owned lender is looking at ways to use advanced analytics to sift through data and find patterns that indicate incipient stress. In an interview, Ashwini Kumar Tewari, managing director in charge of risk, compliance, and stressed assets at SBI, explained how the bank digitized some stressed asset management processes. Edited excerpts: What kind of stress are you seeing among retail and small business borrowers? Most of our retail customers are salaried; therefore, we do not see any challenge. Our non-salaried set, though small, is facing some stress, but the net number taken together is quite under control. While the cashflows to the micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) segment were clearly impacted but our lending parameters to this segment are very stringent. We do not give them an equivalent loan amount as salaried borrowers, and the loan-to-value is also lower. Even in the salaried segment, people lost jobs and had their salaries cut, but since we do not go down to the low credit score profiles, our overall experience in covid-19 has not been adverse. Has technology helped turnaround time in stressed asset resolution? For one-time settlement and compromise, we have an open platform where a person can apply online instead of coming to a branch. Internally we have a dashboard to track this at the operational level as well as the management level. We are thus able to control the turnaround time and see the quantum of recoveries. The legal team is a major component of the stressed assets vertical. We have an application called the Litigation Management System with modules such as the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), the debt recovery tribunal, and courts. Here, the entire case history is available and provides reminders for documents that come up for renewal for the next hearing, among other things. We have also digitized the wilful defaulter management system. What are some of the new technology initiatives your department has planned? We have so much data in the system. It would be useful to leverage this data not only from the risk perspective but also to see how things are moving in real-time in various parts of the country and different sectors. This is one area where we would like to use artificial intelligence and machine learning. Right now, our analytical teams are embedded in the risk, products divisions and operational risk areas. We get all the non-performing asset (NPA) data from across the country, including individual account data, and the aggregation happens at the circle level. Say there are problems in the steel sector in a particular state; one way to know is to track media reports but is our database showing impending stress from that region? After it becomes NPA, it will have to be dealt with, but if there are early indicators of stress, then this can be handled proactively. Do you think it is faster to resolve stressed loans outside the purview of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)? In a few cases where we realized that getting upfront cash is important and the process itself may take a long time, it is better to sell to asset reconstruction companies.I believe there are certain changes being contemplated in IBC. If they happen, like pre-pack insolvency for corporates, we may have some more cases handled better. Everyone talks about the highlighted cases, but the smaller cases of ₹5 lakh or ₹10 lakh are not in the media. There are cases from branches in tier 3 and tier 4 cities which are seeing very good recovery."

Invariably we have seen that during inflationary conditions gold is one of the preferred asset classes and that means there is traction for gold loans too,"" said Khara, adding that the bank has a 24% market share in gold loans. Khara said that in first quarter of FY23, SBI saw decent traction in gold loans and much better growth compared to what it witnessed in the same period in the past. “I expect that in the current year (FY23), we should be in a position to grow well in this segment,"" he said. On retail loan growth, Khara said it continues to be an important engine for the public sector lender. “(Going by) the way it has grown in the past, we expect that we should be in a position to ride the growth potential available in the retail segment,"" he said. However, it does not mean that other opportunities are not available in terms of the asset growth, he said, adding that there is demand from the corporates, small businesses and also in the international book.

We seem to be nearing a trough in the asset-quality cycle and provisioning levels appear demonstrably sufficient. Capitalisation for sector-leading large private banks is more than adequate in our view,"" it said in a note on Indian banks. BNP Paribas thinks deposit flows have entrenched a lot of cost-stability advantages that larger banks enjoy. Valuations, while not a bargain, are not in the highest reaches of trading bands either. BNP Paribas' top stock picks - HDFC Bank: The global brokerage believes recent headwinds on tech investment news flow create a special opportunity in HDFC Bank as its traditional strengths (CASA tailwinds, best-in-class asset quality) are being somewhat discounted. Its Buy tag on HDFC Bank shares comes with a target price of ₹1,710. ICICI Bank: ICICI Bank remains a play on credit revival with high provisioning levels, tech investments and continued CASA mobilization, it said with target price of ₹890.  Axis Bank: “We choose Axis Bank for the valuation headroom it offers as well as gearing to a credit cycle recovery through both asset quality and loan growth. Our comfort with AXSB’s provision levels is as high as what we have for ICICIBC’s but recognise that a lower CASA and higher cost of funds ensure that higher rates do not confer an equal amount of competitive benefits on it as on HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank,"" the note stated. The brokerage's Buy tag on the bank stock comes with a target price of ₹970. Further, BNP Paribas also has buy ratings on IndusInd Bank (TP: ₹1,030), AU Small Finance Bank (TP: ₹750) and State Bank of India (SBI) with price target at ₹500.

All residents, including minors, are eligible to apply for the scheme through a single or joint method, according to SBI's official website. Customers who are NRO or NRE are not eligible for this product, however, senior citizens are eligible for an additional rate of interest over the regular rate. According to SBI guidelines, one can apply for the SBI Annuity Scheme using savings, current, or OD account, and the account selected for the scheme must be a legitimate operational account with Internet Banking enabled and the account should not have been halted, dormant, or locked.  The SBI Annuity Scheme is available at all SBI branches and comes with a tenure of 36, 60, 84, or 120 months. To establish an SBI Annuity Scheme with a maturity duration of 3 to 10 years, a minimum deposit amount for annuity deposit must be made, which is based on a minimum monthly annuity of Rs. 1000 for the applicable period. According to SBI guidelines, the maximum deposit limit through online banking would be the same as the maximum limit set for fund transfer within one's own account but through offline mode, no maximum deposit limit is there. The interest rate provided on the SBI Annuity Deposit Scheme will be as applicable to term deposits of the term chosen by the account holder. On the SBI Annuity Scheme, the rate of interest applicable to SBI Term Deposits for the general public and senior citizens will be offered. SBI increased interest rates on fixed deposits on June 14, 2022. SBI currently offers an interest rate of 5.45 per cent to 5.50 per cent to the general public and 5.95 per cent to 6.30 per cent to senior citizens on deposits maturing in 3 to 10 years. TDS will be applied to the interest paid on the Annuity deposit and for this PAN is necessary to submit to avoid the TDS amount.  Premature closure is authorized in the event of the depositor's death, and premature payment is permissible for deposits up to Rs. 15.00 lacs, according to SBI's terms and conditions. Premature withdrawals are subject to the same premature penalty as term deposits. According to SBI's current premature closure guidelines, for term deposits above ₹5.00 lacs, the applicable penalty will be 1% (all tenors) and 1% below the rate applicable at the time of deposit will be provided to the depositor as a premature withdrawal amount for the period of deposit remained with the bank. An overdraft/loan of up to 75% of the balance amount of the annuity can be issued for specific circumstances such as education, marriage, or any other emergency. According to SBI, annuity payments will be credited to the loan account only after the OD/loan has been disbursed."
