Updated: 08 Jul 2022,ICICI Securities sees good upside for Tata Steel in 3 months: Should you buy?,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/icici-securities-sees-good-upside-for-tata-steel-in-3-months-should-you-buy-11657285025295.html,"Shares of Tata Steel have witnessed a heavy sell-off in 2022 as in year-to-date time, Tata Steel share price has fallen from around ₹1142 to ₹885 apiece levels, logging around 22 per cent dip in this time frame.

ICICI Securities, a brokerage, has issued a buy call today for the stock with a target price of Rs. 1045, a buying range of Rs. 875-895, and a stop loss of Rs. 799. According to the brokerage, the stock's upside will be achieved within 3 months of the target frame. As per ICICI Securities, “the Nifty has remained volatile since the beginning of the May series along with broader markets. From the metal space, Tata Steel witnessed a significant correction on the back of a sharp decline in metal prices amid fear of global recession. However, after the correction of almost 45% from the top we feel currently it is in a pullback mode as it reverted from its Put base. We believe the recent momentum seen in the stock will be followed by fresh longs in coming sessions."" “Leveraged positions in the stock have declined noticeably till the current series as stock prices remained in a declining trend. However, since the early July series, the stock has been witnessing long accumulation where OI has risen marginally. The stock has been able to trade above its resistance level of ₹900, suggesting further upsides. The stock has been witnessing accumulation near the support level of ₹840-850. With continued Put writing in 800 and 860 strikes, we expect downside risk to be limited. On the other hand, Call OI of 860 and 880 strike is already witnessing closure of positions suggesting positive bias in the stock. These positions are expected to aid it in breaking the option range on the higher side,"" the brokerage has said in a note. “The stock has seen one of the notable delivery based action around ₹900 in the last couple of weeks. Since then, it has been crawling northwards with early signs of the stock making a base at the support area. The stock is trading near its long term mean-2*sigma levels. Currently, this level is placed near ₹810. We believe sustainability at current levels itself should provide momentum in the stock towards our target levels of ₹1045,"" said the research analysts of ICICI Securities. “In November 2020-August 2021, the stock had witnessed an impulsive up move towards ₹1500. Since then, it has largely seen time and price based correction. This recent decline towards ₹800-850 has given another opportunity to go long on the stock,"" said the brokerage. Tata Steel is a company with a high dividend yield and has shown a positive profit increase of over 76 per cent CAGR over the past five years. With a book value per share of Rs. 958.50 for Tata Steel, the stock is now selling at a low price to book value (P/B) of 0.92 times its book value.

Stocks in Asia closed higher on easing recession woes fears, while US stock-index futures and European equities fell as a pall of gloom descended on global markets after former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot to death.  Markets ended higher for the third day in a row as inflationary concerns eased amid weak oil prices. The Sensex gained  303.38 points or 0.56% at 54,481.84, while the Nifty rose 0.54% to 16,220.60.  While most Nifty sectoral indices ended in the green, metals and realty were the laggards. Larsen and Toubro, Power Grid Corporation, and NTPC were among the top gainers., Tata Steel, and Maruti Suzuki lagged. Meanwhile, a pall of gloom descended on global markets as former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot to death. The news was a further blow to investors already reeling under the worst economic challenges since the 2008 financial crisis.   Chairman N Chandrasekaran said the firm aims to have an electricity generation capacity of 30 GW during the same period with more than half coming from clean energy sources.   IDBI Mutual Fund, Canara Robeco Mutual Fund, and Axis Mutual fund have announced a revision in the risk-o-meter for some of their schemes. In all the cases, the assessed risk level of the schemes has gone down from what it was earlier. This was done to reflect the change in the risk levels of these schemes subsequent to an evaluation.   The demand conditions for Kalyan Jewellers India Ltd seem to be encouraging. So far, there has been no considerable impact on demand post the government’s recent move to raise import duty on gold, said Ramesh Kalyanaraman, executive director, Kalyan Jewellers. Even so, how demand pans out in the coming days would be a crucial factor to watch out for in the short-run. The company remains one of the key beneficiaries of the shift in demand from the unorganized to the organized segment.   We expect life insurers to report robust NBP/APE growth YoY with the base effect playing out. The focus on higher-margin products (non-par, protection and annuity products) and subsequent improvement in the product mix are likely to improve the margins for life insurers. With rising rates, we could witness near-term headwinds, as an increase in discount rates could potentially impact the Embedded Value (EV) of life insurers. Broking revenues are likely to take a hit owing to weak cash segment volumes. However, F&O volumes have held up well. A sharp drop in capital market activity (IPO market) will dent issuer and advisory services revenues. While distribution income is likely to improve YoY, it will witness moderation QoQ (seasonal phenomena). New customer sourcing is likely to slow down with a focus on acquiring better quality customers. Positive result plays: ICICI Bank, SBI, SBI Cards, AU Small Finance Bank, Bajaj Finance   The government on Friday clarified that the export duty on air turbine fuel introduced last week will not apply if it is supplied as fuel to “foreign going aircraft"". The clarification comes amid reports that one of the three oil marketing companies (OMCs) started charging 11% basic excise duty on ATF from domestic airlines for international flights. It caused unrest among airlines as they feared that will make international operations expensive and put them at a disadvantage viz a viz foreign airlines, which are exempt from the duty.   European shares were muted on Friday, weighed down by miners as copper prices retreated on concerns over latest Covid-19 curbs and infection flare-ups in China, while investors also maintained a cautious stance ahead of monthly U.S. jobs data. The continent-wide STOXX 600 index was down 0.1%, after climbing 3.6% in the previous two sessions.   Consumer demand remained mixed during 1Q23 showing twin impacts of 1) price hikes and inflation in staples and 2) positive impact of fading Covid waves, low base and pent up demand across QSR, Apparel and retail segments. We expect staple margins to show pressure, however expect margin expansion post 2Q due to price hikes being absorbed and likely softening of commodity prices. QSR, Retail and discretionary segments are expected to report strong revenue growth of 33.5% and outlook remains good over next 2-3 years. We expect EBITDA margins to weaken QoQ by 15bp. Adj PAT is expected to grow by 34.5% YoY. We expect a wide range of volume growth from mid-single digit decline to low double digit growth across companies under our coverage universe barring Jewellery/QSRs segments. We remain structurally positive on Westlife, Britannia, HUL, D’Mart, Titan, APNT and Moldtek given sustainable competitive advantage and business moats. Valuations have corrected from peak; however, they are still higher than last 10-year average. We rate D’Mart, Dabur & Westlife as top picks. ITC is a tactical pick given solid performance and favorable valuations, any potential excise duty changes remains a key risk for the stock. TOP PICKS -Dabur: We expect Inflationary pressures to keep margins volatile in the near term even as long term story remains intact led by 1) sustained increase in direct rural reach from 55000 villages to 88000 villages 2) GTM initiatives in ecommerce and modern trade and 3) sustained innovation across portfolio including regional customization. We estimate EPS growth of 13.1% and 19.7% in FY23 & FY24 respectively. We estimate 16% EPS CAGR over FY23-24 and assign DCF based target price of ₹603. Retain Accumulate. -Westlife Development: Accelerated store expansion from 20-25 stores to 40-50 stores/year (200 stores over 3-4 years). WDL is piloting fried chicken in western markets to gauge the response, as it looks set to launch Gourmet Burgers in south India. With no major capex within existing stores, chicken sales can offer Rs500mn incremental revenues with high gross margins of 65-70% which will be margin accretive. Despite opening up of economy, convenience channel contribution continues to remain strong. We expect AUV to increase led by convenience channel sales, new product innovations like Gourmet Burgers, Fried chicken and sustained scale up of McCafe which shall enable profitable growth in the coming years. We estimate Sales CAGR of 25.0% over FY22-24 with an EPS of Rs6.4/ Rs9.2 in FY23/24. We assign DCF based target price of Rs653. (Rs645 earlier). ‘BUY’ for long term gains. -Avenue Supermart: D’Mart remains a structural pick given 1) strong entry barriers in brick and mortar modern trade 2) Long growth path as it has scope to increase stores by 3.5x in catchments where it has entered 3) Strong growth prospects, as it is yet to fully sweat 80 stores opened during Covid 3) Expected margin expansion, as general merchandise and apparel category has suffered during Covid and 5) Rising city coverage and strong traction in D’Mart Ready. With Bill cuts/store/day 33% lower than FY20 and gains from inflationary environment, we estimate 42% PAT CAGR over FY22-24. Retain ‘BUY’ -Over the past 2 weeks, HUVR/BRIT have rallied sharply by 20%/13% led by tailwinds in commodity prices. Key input materials such as crude oil & palm oil have corrected by 20.8%/55.0% from peak levels. Crude oil prices have fallen due to recession fears in western markets, while Palm oil prices have fallen due to increased exports from Indonesia & Malaysia. We place our BUY rating on the stocks ‘UNDER REVIEW’ given change in business environment and would revise our rating/ Target Price post 1Q23 earnings.   The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 154.2 points last month versus a revised 157.9 for May.   Celsius Network, the crypto lender that froze assets last month, used customer funds to manipulate the price of its proprietary token and lost hundreds of millions of dollars by failing to hedge risk, a former money manager for the company said in a lawsuit.   Asian markets rose Friday on easing recession fears with optimism boosted by hopes that Joe Biden will remove some Trump-era tariffs from Chinese goods. The safe-haven yen also picked up following news of Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe being shot during a campaign rally. He is still fighting for his life. Tokyo - Nikkei 225 rose 0.1 percent at 26,517.19, Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index rose 0.2 percent at 21,680.96 Shanghai - Composite fell 0.4 percent at 3,356.08     Multiplexes are expected to outperform in the first quarter of FY23 as compared to all earlier quarters in the post-pandemic era led by the successful run of films like RRR, KGF: Chapter 2 and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2. Chains like PVR and INOX Leisure Ltd are likely to post revenues of Rs. 9.25 billion and Rs. 5.5 billion respectively, according to estimates by brokerages like Edelweiss and Elara.

(PTI)   -Aggregate Revenue/EBIDTA expected to decline by ~1%/3% QoQ. -Aggregate EBITDA margins (excl JLR) expected to largely remain flat QoQ, with RM cost pressures partly offset by price hikes and cost controls. In 1QFY23 two-wheeler (2W) segment topped charts with ~8% QoQ growth, supported by marriage season demand (especially in entry-level segment Hero’s volume grew 17% QoQ), while Passenger vehicle (PV) segment remained largely muted (2% decline). PV retail enquiries and bookings are currently healthy. With semiconductor supply now normalizing, PV OEMs are serving their already healthy order book and mitigating longer waiting periods. Commercial vehicle (CV) segment witnessed ~9% decline QoQ, led by seasonality factor. However, on-ground situation is much better as fleet utilization levels are healthy, led by increased economic and infrastructural activities. Tractor segment volumes witnessed an uptick with onset of monsoon season. For our OEM coverage universe, we expect aggregate revenue decline of ~1% QoQ. Gross margins to contract by ~60bps for most OEMs, due to lag impact of higher commodity prices in 4QFY22. From 2QFY23 onwards, we expect margin expansion for auto OEMs driven by softening of commodity prices, price hikes and upcoming festive season. We remain structurally positive on CV play and expect Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors to benefit from CV recovery. Tata Motors will further benefit from strong PV volumes supported by new models, EV and recovery at JLR. Our top picks are Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors.     The CBI has registered a fresh case against former National Stock Exchange (NSE) chiefs Chitra Ramkrishna, Ravi Narain and ex-Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Pandey, on the directions of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), for allegedly tapping phones of NSE employees between 2009 and 2017.

Gold has steadied after testing 9-month low as US dollar index paused after lack of surprise form FOMC minutes and amid positioning for US non-farm payrolls data which is expected to show slower jobs growth. However, weighing on price is monetary tightening stance of Fed and other central banks and weaker investor interest as is evident from ETF outflows. Gold has fallen sharply and may see some recovery however a sharp rise is unlikely unless US dollar corrects.   Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra rose 5.4% in early trade on Friday on NSE taking the stock to a new 52-week high of Rs1194.90 apiece. This comes on the back of the company’s announcement of executing an agreement with British International Investment, UK’s development finance institution, to invest up to Rs1,925 crore or $250 million each into a new wholly owned EV subsidiary of M&M. “Net value accretion to M&M shareholders will depend on its ability to leverage the electrification trend and expand its market share in the SUV segment. Currently, we are not valuing the EV business separately as it doesn’t have any material presence in the electric PV segment,"" said Motilal Oswal in a report.   Nifty's 16000-16045 odd level should act as the demand zone and cushion any minor blips. The 16200 sub-level is likely to be seen as the immediate resistance, breaching which the next potential hurdle could be seen around the 16325-16400 zone. Going forward, our market is likely to remain upbeat in the near term, wherein any minor dip could be seen as an opportunity for the bulls to add long positions. From here on, we may expect gradual moves in key indices, but individual pockets are now likely to outshine. Hence, it’s advisable to keep focusing on such potential movers, which are likely to provide better trading opportunities. Also, we would like to reiterate not being complacent with the gains and staying abreast with daily developments across the globe.   The move comes after the central bank had returned a large number of payment aggregator licence applications earlier this year, that it had received from many firms. The RBI is now expected to release a complete list of the players who have been approved to operate as payment aggregators in the country shortly, the report added.   We expect companies in our retail coverage universe to deliver a strong show in Q1FY23 (the only non-disrupted quarter in the last two years). As per our channel checks, fashion retailers, on a per store basis, have registered a recovery rate in the range of 110%+ of pre-Covid levels. The optimism was driven by improved consumer sentiments, wardrobe refresh and increased spend on discretionary purchases as consumer wallet share on non-essentials had remained subdued in the last two years. Also, fashion lifestyle retailers had built up healthy inventory for spring summer season in Q4FY22 after curtailing purchases for nearly two years (on an average, absolute inventory increased 1.5x YoY). On a favourable base of Q1FY22, we expect revenues to more than double (2.4x YoY) for our companies in our coverage universe (impressive three-year CAGR: 17%). In a bid to negate inflationary pressure, apparel retailers have taken price hikes in the range of 15-20%. Expect EBITDA margins to improve 80 bps QoQ (down 70 bps vs. Q1FY20 levels) to 12.3% in Q1FY23E. During the quarter, retailers continued calibrated expansion of their store network with opening of 10 D-Mart stores, 19 Tanishq stores, 56 Titan EyeCare stores, eight Zudio stores, three Westside stores and 11 V-Mart stores (including four Unlimited stores). Companies have restructured their existing store networks and aggressively enhanced footprint on a pan-India basis with emphasis on penetrating deeper in Tier III-V cities to capture potential demand pockets.   Positivity rate at 4.95%, recovery rate is 98.52% & mortality rate is 1.21%   Global gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) registered 28 tonnes or $1.7 billion of outflows in June, which the second straight month of selloff, according to a report by the World Gold Council. In India, minor net inflows continued in June, primarily driven by market volatility and a depreciating rupee attracting investment into Indian gold ETFs   Multiple Indian funds have urgently petitioned the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to ease the overseas investment cap for Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) to avoid missing out on deals but are facing a steep battle amid the sharp fall in the rupee in recent months, three people aware of the development said. Overseas investments by Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) cumulatively hit the $1.5 billion threshold just last week, one of the people cited above said. Sebi allows 25% of an AIF’s investible corpus to be invested overseas at an individual level with a $1.5 billion cap at an aggregate level for all AIFs.   Days after IndiGo suffered major flight delays due to cabin crew unavailability, the airline reinstated pilot salaries by 8% that will be effective from 1 August. “On 31st March, we were able to reinstate 8% effective 1st April, 2022 and had committed to you that an additional reinstatement of 6.5% would be implemented from 1st November 2022 based on the environment,"" read an internal letter sent to the pilots       Gold firmed on Friday as the dollar came slightly off two-decade highs, but bullion was set to post its biggest weekly drop in more than a month as the elevated greenback hit demand.

The pandemic-era overseas borrowing boom by Indian companies has started to slow as interest rates rise, the currency weakens, and the appetite for emerging market bonds diminishes. Measures announced by the Reserve Bank of India easing overseas borrowings by companies, including doubling the annual limit under the automatic route to $1.5 billion and raising the all-in cost cap for foreign debt, though welcome, will do little to spur the market in the near term, experts said.

Steel players use iron ore as raw material to make steel and coal to feed their captive power plants. According to SteelMint, prices of hot rolled coil (HRC) are ruling in the range of ₹59,000-60,000 a tonne from its peak in May at ₹76,000/tonne.

Analysts at JPMorgan do not see further declines in the domestic steel market.  ""Overall Tata Steel remains committed to ~$1 bn net debt reduction, and we see upside risk to this number if underlying earnings hold up at current levels. With the combination of working capital release and elevated underlying earnings, Tata Steel should deliver another year of material net debt reduction,"" the note stated.  The global brokerage has overweight tag on the Indian metal stock. Its June 2023 target price is ₹1,400 per share, implying a potential upside of more than 58% from the current stock level. While markets are likely to fear an immediate recession, JPMorgan believe the steel market is also facing a series of one-off issues (export tax, China demand decline on COVID-19, rains) that should ease. “Tata Steel's Europe footprint has materially declined, and India should continue to increase. TATA’s KPO expansion of 5MT, large captive iron ore mining ramp-up and new brownfield expansion pipeline yield strong volume visibility with an improving balance sheet,"" it added. Though, key downside risks to its rating and price target include a sharp decline in steel spreads and a sharp decline in steel demand in India, the brokerage said. “While TATA has attractive growth optionality across multiple sites in India (NINL, KPO, Meramandali), we believe the key constraint for TATA (and the large Indian Resource companies) is NOT capital, but how to deploy it aggressively on the ground. Large projects remain difficult to execute on time given labor mobilization and contractor issues. TATA’s 5MT KPO should be commissioned in 2HFY24, and post that we would expect TATA to start work on the next expansion,"" JPMorgan's note stated. Tata Steel, part of Tata Group, is one of the leading steel manufacturing companies of India. The company posted a 47% jump in its consolidated net profit at ₹9,756 crore for the quarter ended March 2022. Its revenue from operations, meanwhile, rose 38% to ₹69,323 crore. For Europe business, revenues increased by 54% over last year to £8,876 million and EBITDA stood at £1,199 million.

An Indian monetary policy dove signaled it’s probably time to abandon the aggressive pace of increases in borrowing costs, saying the inflation-adjusted real interest-rate is approaching neutral terrain -- a level where it can help check inflation without stifling economic growth. Sticking to larger hikes instead carries the risk of crimping an already weak demand without materially softening inflation, Ashima Goyal, one of the six members of the Monetary Policy Committee, warned in an email interview, adding that she isn’t speaking on behalf of the full MPC. “Indian real interest rates are not far from neutral,"" she said, referring to benchmark rate that’s risen to 4.9%, amid inflation easing to 7% in May from 7.8% in the previous month   Asian shares were mostly higher Tuesday after a wobbly day on Wall Street as markets cooled off following a rare winning week.

Spot gold was last up 0.1% at $1,824.65 per ounce by 0056 GMT. U.S. gold futures were flat at $1,824.70.

Oil rose for a third session as threats to global output risked tightening the market further before OPEC+ meets this week to discuss supply. West Texas Intermediate futures climbed above $110 a barrel after adding about 5% over the past two sessions. Libya is facing more disruptions to its exports due to a worsening political crisis, while anti-government protests in Ecuador threaten to shut down production in the former OPEC member. Any halt to supply could reverberate through the global oil market, which has been squeezed by an economic rebound and upended trade flows from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. Some OPEC+ members have struggled to meet their production targets this year, exacerbating the tightness.   Asian shares edge down in early trade on Tuesday with investors taking their cue from a volatile Wall Street session overnight, while oil prices climbed following last week's rout. Oil continued to rise with investors still weighing worries over an economic slowdown against concern over lost Russian supply amid sanctions related to the conflict in Ukraine.

US stocks ended a volatile trading session slightly lower on Monday after posting sharp gains the week before, while oil prices and Treasury yields rose. Oil climbed following last week's rout, as the Group of Seven nations promised to tighten the squeeze on Russia's finances with new sanctions that include a plan to cap the price of Russian oil. Investors have been hoping oil's slide from three-month peaks hit earlier in June could ease overall inflation concerns and allow the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten policy less aggressively than initially feared. Stocks moved between gains and losses during the session on Wall Street, with big growth shares leading the way down. The S&P 500 earlier this month confirmed it is in a bear market.
