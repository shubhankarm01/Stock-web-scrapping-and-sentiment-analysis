Updated: 02 Feb 2021,HDFC’s growth recovery should impress but stress shows its head,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/hdfcs-growth-recovery-should-impress-but-stress-shows-its-head-11612267743622.html,"Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) has been consistently better than peers on asset quality to the benefit of its investors. In FY21 so far too, the mortgage lender has managed to maintain its asset quality but not without challenges. For the December quarter, its Statge 3 assets or delinquencies rose 6% sequentially, an indication of incremental stress, albeit small. Adjusted to the judicial standstill on asset recognition, HDFC’s gross bad loan ratio stood at 1.91% of its loans for Q3. This is far higher than 0.75% a year ago. The troubled asset pile has risen 57% year-on-year (y-o-y) given the impact of the pandemic. Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd pointed out that the rise in Stage 2 assets indicates the lender may have restructured loans. HDFC said that it has restructured loans worth ₹5,000 crore as of December end under the regulatory forbearance. This forms 0.9% of the lender’s assets under management (AUM). The bulk of these loans are from the non-individual portfolio. Retail loans restructured were only 26% of the total restructured pile. This again shows that HDFC’s stress is limited to its developer loan book.  Understandably, much of this stress has come from the non-individual book because of stressed developers. As secured individual loans form a lion’s share of HDFC’s portfolio, the overall impact of stress has been limited. The individual book has stood the test of time with delinquencies remaining negligible. Even so, Stage 3 assets form 2.3% of total asset book, which is 69 basis points higher from a year earlier. Improving collections every month has helped the lender maintain asset quality. Collections have risen to 97.6% for individual loans and are close to pre-pandemic levels. Given the lower-than anticipated stress, the lender’s provisions have reduced y-o-y. For Q3, HDFC set aside ₹594 crore as provisions, 80% lower than the year-ago period. That said, the company holds provisions nearly double than what is required by regulation. HDFC’s shares have risen 3% in the past month after its update on operating metrics on 5 January cheered investors. Indeed, it wins over peers on growth recovery. Retail loan disbursements rose 26% y-o-y. On an AUM basis though, HDFC reported a 10% growth in retail and 7% in its non-individual book. These are levels far lower than what the lender has been historically clocking every quarter. However, HDFC’s focus on affordable housing may come to its aid here. Since the budget has extended the tax deduction benefit on affordable housing loans, HDFC may see continued expansion here. While growth has improved despite the pandemic’s impact, the lender still has a long road ahead for a complete recovery. After gaining 23% in the past three months, HDFC shares trade at a 4.4 times estimated book value for FY22."

Updated: 03 Jul 2020,HDFC's Deepak Parekh once again pushes for one-time debt recast for developers,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/hdfc-s-deepak-parekh-once-again-pushes-for-one-time-debt-recast-for-developers-11593748635274.html,"MUMBAI: Deepak Parekh, a doyen of India's banking and finance sector, has again suggested that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should permit a one-time debt recast of developer loans. In his letter to shareholders, the hairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) said this has been a long-standing request and a measure implemented in the past to revive the sector. “If developers do not have cashflows due to a slowdown in sales or delay in receiving requisite building approvals, they can neither complete the existing projects nor can they service their loans,"" he said. According to Parekh, even if a lender is willing to help the project stay viable, any modification in the terms of the loan, including additional funding is construed to be a non-performing loan under the current regulatory norms. “Allowing for a restructuring of these loans and categorising them as standard assets will facilitate last mile funding for these projects,"" said Parekh. This is not the first time Parekh is seen pitching for a one-time debt recast of real estate loans. News agency PTI reported on 28 January that ahead of the presentation of the Union Budget 2020-21, Parekh pitched for a one-time loan recast for realty projects. “We are talking to the regulators, we have spoken to the finance ministry, one-time restructuring is absolutely necessary,"" Parekh was quoted by PTI as saying. Then again in April, PTI reported that Parekh has pushed for a one-time restructuring of stressed real estate accounts and relaxation in classification of NPA norms to 180 days from 90 days to help the sector. Led by the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA), lenders have sought a one-time debt recast of loans from the central bank, a proposal yet to be approved. Bankers expect asset quality to take a beating once the moratorium ends. Rating agency Crisil estimates that bad loans will rise to 11-11.5% by March 2021 from the 9.6% expected for FY20. Meanwhile, Parekh also said that the saga of the highest court of law questioning the RBI on the moratorium was indeed unfortunate. He was referring to the case in the Supreme Court where the decision to levy interest on loans during the RBI-permitted loan moratorium is being scrutinised. “Why should a central bank have to be answerable to a court on basic principles which the financial sector operates on? Interest payments on borrowings and loans are contractual obligations. No laws are being violated,"" said Parekh."

Updated: 03 Jul 2019,"RBI to regulate housing finance firms, review assets: Report",https://www.livemint.com/politics/policy/rbi-to-regulate-housing-finance-firms-review-assets-report-1562156625706.html,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI : India will soon give Reserve Bank of India (RBI) power to regulate housing finance companies (HFCs), which will almost certainly lead to the lenders facing stringent asset quality reviews, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. That could have major repercussions for about 80 HFCs, the largest of which include Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd, Housing Development Finance Corporation and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation, leading to them facing unprecedented scrutiny and the potential for major financial penalties and restriction on their activities if improper practices are discovered. In late 2015, the RBI started a similar review of bank assets amid allegations that lenders were hiding the extent of the bad debts on their books. During multiple asset quality reviews of banks, the RBI revealed a plethora of areas where lenders were under reporting their bad loans. It initially led to financial penalties for some lenders and eventually fed into decisions to impose tougher restrictions on their loan books while their bad debts remained high. The housing finance companies, which are part of the broader shadow banking sector known as non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), are currently regulated by the National Housing Board, and the central bank has no direct authority over them. The other NBFCs are very loosely regulated, with various regulators including the RBI having some role but no one being fully accountable. The RBI's oversight of HFCs will be a step towards the Indian authorities getting a firmer grip on the risky shadow banking sector that will help to contain any systemic problems. A series of debt defaults last year by major infrastructure financing group, Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS), showed that much of the sector was highly leveraged. ""There will be substantial improvement in regulation and supervision of all entities including NBFCs and HFCs once RBI has direct control over the housing finance firms,"" one of the sources said. On Monday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government was considering giving more powers to the central bank to regulate the struggling shadow banking sector, though she was not specific. A government official, who did not wish to be named, was more explicit in comments on Wednesday. ""The government is planning to give more regulatory powers to the RBI to regulate housing finance companies. Right now they do not have that."" One of the sources said the central bank sought more regulatory powers so that it could be more effective in handling liquidity crunches in the sector, which have hit lending and the overall economy. The Reserve Bank of India declined to comment on the development. As credit rating firms have downgraded the ratings of some of the housing finance companies it has stoked credit-risk fears and hurt their ability to raise funds for more lending. That in turn has made it difficult for consumers and small businesses to get loans and hurt car and motorbike sales, among other things. The failure of a large Indian non-banking financial company could cause as much damage as the collapse of a big commercial lender, the RBI said last week, stressing the need for greater surveillance of these firms. Both the government and RBI have declined to provide direct financial support to financially troubled NBFCs so far. But having regulatory powers over the HFCs might make it easier for the RBI to open credit lines for these firms if necessary, two of the three sources said. The National Housing Board was controlled by the RBI before the government took over the housing finance regulator on April 29. Shifting the regulatory powers to the RBI will, however, take place later in the year as it will require a change to the RBI Act, the government official said. This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text. Only the headline has been changed."
Updated: 13 May 2019,"For HDFC, it is quality over margins, but realty slowdown is hard to escape",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/for-hdfc-it-is-quality-over-margins-but-realty-slowdown-is-hard-to-escape-1557748605554.html,"MUMBAI : Pristine asset quality and stellar profit growth is almost a given when it comes to Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) Ltd, and the mortgage lender didn’t disappoint in the March quarter. The company reported a 27% jump in net profit for the March quarter, beating the Street’s estimates. It also reported enviable asset quality metrics as its bad loan ratios improved from a year before. Bad loans formed just 2.2% of its total loan book and the company continued to make provisions far higher than required by the regulator. This was thanks to HDFC’s sensible move to focus on retail borrowers, even though margins are low here, compared with giving loans to developers and their allies. Ergo, the over 1% gain in the stock in a weak market was due to the fact that there no unpleasant surprises from the mortgage lender. After all, its peers have reported troublesome asset quality and a deceleration in growth due to the slowdown in the real estate sector. The pain from developer financing is widespread among housing finance companies. Over the last one year, the slowdown in real estate has deepened even as a liquidity crunch at financing companies has hurt real estate developers. In this backdrop, HDFC has managed to maintain its 15% loan growth through its focus on its strengths which are retail borrowers. Since lending to developers has become fraught with risks, the lender has embraced lending to affordable housing in a big way on the retail side. During the year, 18% of HDFC’s total loan approvals were to customers from the economically weaker section and low income groups. But the malaise in real estate is too deep and the liquidity problem too wide for even HDFC to completely escape it. Hence, the mortgage lender has seen its loan growth decelerate to a multi-quarter as its developer loan book shrank. In FY19, HDFC gave 85% of disbursals to retail customers and the rest to construction and lease rental firms. Developers didn’t get anything from it. To be sure, the slowdown is also due to a jump in sale of loans to HDFC Bank. “We believe that the gap in growth rates of AUMs and loans will narrow from mid-FY20 onwards as base of sell-downs normalise,"" said analysts at CLSA India Pvt. Ltd. As the adjoining chart shows, the mortgage lender has seen a sharp drop its loan growth rate. That said, HDFC has managed to maintain its spreads, and margins improved slightly in the March quarter. The company’s asset quality and reasonable loan growth buttress its valuations and the performances of its subsidiaries too add weight. The stock trades at a multiple of nearly four times its estimated book value for FY20."
