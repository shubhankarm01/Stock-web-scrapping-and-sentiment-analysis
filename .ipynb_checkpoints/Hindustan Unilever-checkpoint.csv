Updated: 03 Jul 2022,Quick commerce boom to drive ice cream sales: HUL,https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/quick-commerce-boom-to-drive-ice-cream-sales-hul-11656869183710.html,"NEW DELHI : Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s (HUL) ice cream business under the umbrella brand Kwality Wall’s is back to pre-pandemic levels, thanks to the prolonged summer this year. In an interview, Srinandan Sundaram, executive director, foods and refreshment, HUL, spoke about the surprise business recovery, increased focus on home delivery channels and an eye on viable acquisitions. Edited excerpts:    Have the sales of your foods and refreshment portfolio returned to pre-pandemic levels? Foods and refreshment has the tea, coffee, Horlicks and Boost, Kissan and Knorr and the ice cream businesses. Specifically in the context of ice creams, we are now seeing us move ahead of pre-pandemic levels. We assumed a certain set of growth but the growth rates far surpassed it. We got probably a good 10% to 12% higher growth than what we thought we will get. For two years, all the covid disruptions happened in March, April and May—peak season for ice cream.  The fact is that covid has not disrupted businesses this season, ice creams have been able to come back quite strongly.  It was a combination of weather becoming hotter and hotter, little bit of a delay in monsoon and this whole bit of when everything around us is expensive, it’s probably the smallest cost celebration a family can have.  Any numbers you could share?  We are reaching our closed period. But our ice cream portfolio has Magnum as the premium brand, then Cornetto and Feast which really sit in the middle and you’ve got the in-home through Wall’s which is the party packs. Kwality was acquired  in 1995 and Kwality Wall’s became the umbrella brand. We’ve also had an acquisition a couple of years back of Adityaa Milk (Vijaykant Dairy and Foods Products Ltd) for its ice cream business.  How do you plan to grow the business?  The journey has been largely one of developing this market. If you benchmark per capita consumption of ice cream in India, it’s among the lowest across the Unilever countries in which we operate. It’s close to 400ml per capita per year. It’s a country which has very little ice cream, very infrequently but has a hell of a lot of dessert.  This market is still seeing a lot more outside-the-home consumption. But with quick commerce coming in, they are also now beginning to see if people are ordering home.  That will help the industry to grow because if you want to have an ice cream and somebody can deliver it to you within half an hour, 40 minutes, for sure, it’s something that drives up the adoption.  So are you working towards home delivery?  Yes, it’s called Ice cream Now—a platform within our company, where we partner with pure quick commerce which is the food commerce kind of players of which Swiggy and Zomato is a very large part. We have made a compelling case that ice cream can add to their wallet.  We’re making sure that our brands have consistent presence of portfolio online, which is just availability in terms of physical stock. Then there’s performance marketing to ensure that when you are looking for ice creams, our brand features right on top. Third is to really strengthen the portfolio.  Currently, the channel is small and we’ve put a lot of premium products. Our premium portfolio is over-indexed in contribution because it’s being picked up a lot more by affluent consumers. So, it’s doing a world of wonders for brands like Magnum and premium tubs. Designing exclusively for this channel is still some time away. But that may come sooner than later the way it is going.  What’s your share of online business? It’s upwards of 7% right now. It has coincided with the rise of the investments coming in quick commerce. In fact, it could have been higher had we had planned this season better. The entire industry didn’t expect ice cream to come through the way it has come through. We’ve had issues of availability of stock... we could have done better if we had estimated how soon this industry will bounce back.  Did you expand your distribution during this period?  We did invest in (ice cream) cabinets which is one of the critical things. During covid, we went to a lot of chemist stores because they were allowed to open. More importantly, the chemists are very entrepreneurial. 12% is the incremental cabinets that we’ve invested in.  Is your Adityaa Milk acquisition complete? Are you expanding the brand?  Yes, the acquisition is complete. What we learned from Adityaa Milk is how to do low-cost ice cream since we were bringing in innovations only in the premium end of the market.  In this business, ₹10 and ₹20 price points are very crucial. We do sell the brand which is very strong in and around Belgaon. But for us, it is a manufacturing capacity. It’s not that Adityaa acquisition will only make Adityaa products.  Any other acquisitions that you may be eyeing?  Will we eye an acquisition? Yes; if something comes our way. But we can’t discuss it right now."

Updated: 28 Jun 2022,What is ‘shrinkflation’ and how is it playing out in India?,https://www.livemint.com/economy/how-shrinkflation-is-playing-out-in-india-11656335468700.html,"This is a form of inflation that isn’t easily visible to you, the consumer. Yet it has been creeping into your consumption basket lately, one small cut at a time. To tackle high raw material costs, several fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in India are downsizing product packets, while keeping the price unchanged. Dubbed ‘shrinkflation’, this effectively means consumers are paying the same for less of the product. Russia's war with Ukraine has sent commodity prices soaring globally, making it dearer for companies to procure raw materials they need to make daily consumer goods such as eatables and home and personal care products. Overall wholesale inflation in India marched to a 30-year high last month, while Hindustan Unilever Ltd, a top FMCG company, put its net material inflation (NMI) in the March quarter at 4.5 times that in the June quarter of 2020.

Updated: 24 Jun 2022,"Amazon, HUL, Marico ads among ‘most effective’ in 2021",https://www.livemint.com/industry/advertising/amazon-hul-marico-ads-among-most-effective-in-2021-11656057494161.html,"Campaigns by consumer firms Amazon, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Marico, Mondelez and Whirlpool made it to the list of the most effective advertisements for 2021 in the television category, data, insights and consulting company Kantar said in its second India report on brand campaigns. Across television ads tested in India, the consultancy awarded standout performers in five product categories: food and beverage, personal care, durables, home care and services. The report titled ‘Creative Effectiveness Awards in India’ also included a special segment on social causes and ‘Un-stereotype’ which lauds gender progressive advertising. In the global study that covered more than 13,000 creatives from companies, Kantar looked at classical tools of storytelling. In India, it tested over 1300 ads and the winners exemplify essential characteristics of being creatively engaging and landing persuasive stories that enhance brand sales. The Mondelez ad by creative agency Ogilvy for its brand ChocoBakes Cake shows a boy and his sibling sneaking a cake in the middle of the night in their home very quietly. However, being floored by the taste of the product, their response manages to alert their parents to their stealthy escapade. In the personal care category the Nihar Naturals hair oil ad by Marico shows a girl breaking out of all the stereotypes she is expected to follow and becomes a journalist instead of pursuing a teaching course as was expected of her. Whirlpool’s Intellifresh Everyday Care, Surf Excel Matic Liquid and Amazon also made it to the list of the effective TV ads. In digital it was Vim Liquid, Comfort and Surf Excel that won the Kantar award. Kantar said it tested the ads among consumers. The testing fundamentally entails a survey and the questions that are asked are benchmarked to a database of norms that it has created. Typically, an ad gets tested among anywhere between 200 to 300 consumers within that one year period. Soumya Mohanty, managing director and chief client officer, insights division at the research firm said that the ads are tested on two pillars, the first by the consumer who is the jury which is defined by whether the ad led to any short term sales increases when they felt positively towards the brand. The second is if a brand is able to build equity which is a more long term measure. “Both of these get combined to make a creative impact. A lot of the ads that have won this year show a very positive gender portrayal. The company, she said, uses “un-stereotype"" as a metric where they test advertising to see if they portray a positive image of a female character and a male character and then use it to compare advertisements against each other to see which of them are more true on this aspect. “Ads that do well on the un-stereotype metric actually tend to give a much higher uplift on both brand equity, as well as short-term sales likelihood. So it makes incredible business sense to un-stereotype,"" she added. For creative digital advertising, Kantar said the ads must hook the consumers early and strike an emotive cord. Digital ads must ride the moment and embrace topical issues and trends to engage and be relevant, the company said."
Updated: 24 Jun 2022,Price hikes inevitable in packed consumer goods: HUL’s Paranjpe,https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/price-hikes-inevitable-in-packed-consumer-goods-hul-s-paranjpe-11656009191274.html,"NEW DELHI : Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s chairman Nitin Paranjpe on Thursday flagged the unprecedented levels of inflation, saying while the company will continue to drive its saving agenda, price hikes will be inevitable. “These are not easy times,"" Paranjape said at the company’s 89th Annual General Meeting held virtually on Thursday. “At a macroeconomic level, we are going through probably the most difficult economic situation; inflation is high,"" he said. Paranjpe added that geopolitical tensions, along with the world emerging from the pandemic, has caused disruptions in supply chains. “Therefore, in India, we are probably getting to a situation where we’ve now seen 14 consecutive months of double-digit wholesale price inflation,"" he said. This, he said, has had an effect on the fast-moving consumer goods markets. “The FMCG markets which have generally been strong for a long period of time have started seeing the effect of this. And more recently, we’ve seen market growth rates moderate and volume growth rates have actually become negative in the short term,"" he added. Companies have also been countering unusually high commodity inflation across raw materials. High input inflation has prompted companies to take direct price hikes across their portfolio as well as cut grammages of products they sell. HUL, that sells popular brand such as Sunsilk shampoo and Kissan sauces, said it will continue to drive savings. Paranjpe, however, did not rule out price hikes. “As a company, we are determined to try and see how we can mitigate the impact of some of this to our consumers. And therefore, our first action in all of this is to drive savings hard; your company does a great job at this. We drive continuous improvement and drive efficiencies. We get about 7% savings every single year, and we will continue to drive that hard,"" he said. Ingredients like palm oil, take crude, plastics, and costs of logistics, have seen inflation which is in excess of 50%, he said. The level of inflation is such that despite cost-saving efforts, it is inevitable that the firm will have to hike prices and therefore, they are going up, he said. “When that’s required, we do it in as calibrated a fashion as possible, in as thoughtful manner that is possible. And that’s what we will continue to do. There are price point packs that we have to be watchful, and we will follow the appropriate strategies—sometimes reducing volumes of fill levels, sometimes taking up prices…"" Paranjpe said. HUL is the country’s top pure-play fast moving consumer goods company with a turnover of ₹50,336 crore for the year ended 31 March 2022. The company, with its wide reach across 9 million outlets, is a barometer for household consumption of daily goods. Paranjpe’s comments come as the fast-moving consumer goods sector is seeing a steep slowdown in volume growth; this, along with decadal high inflation is posing a challenge to both companies and households."
Updated: 23 Jun 2022,"India requires astute handling, balancing act for growth: HUL Chairman",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-requires-astute-handling-balancing-act-for-growth-hul-chairman-11655998989814.html,"Amid the inflation in the country rising every quarter, Hindustan Unilever Limited's Chairman Nitin Paranjpe on 23 June said India will require some astute handling and a balancing act to make sure that growth does not stall. Paranjpe, while describing the current macroeconomic situation as 'probably the most difficult economic situation' during the annual general meeting (AGM), said global supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic and geopolitical tensions have had an impact on India as well. ""It is true that we are going through probably the most difficult economic situation. Inflation is high, there are supply chain disruptions that are going on,"" he said. He cited COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tension as reasons which disrupted many supply chains.

I don't know when we have last seen something like that,"" Paranjpe said. Stating that the WPI has had an effect on the Indian market, he said, ""FMCG markets, which have generally been strong for a long period of time, have started seeing the effect of this and more recently, we have seen market growth rates moderate and our volume growth rates have actually become negative in the short term"". ""Many people were complimenting India on how we were coming out of the COVID period but it does mean that the immediate feature is challenging, and it will require some astute handling and a balancing act to be able to make sure that growth does not stall and we are able to contain inflation."" However, he said, ""I remain confident that as a country, we will be able to navigate through this crisis there. It's not just my saying. The World Bank believes that India will remain the fastest-growing economy in the coming years and therefore that should give us look forward to it with optimism even though the short term is very very challenging"". Commenting on the FMCG industry, he said, ""I will say that we have to navigate the short term but I remain confident of the medium-term to longer-term future that this industry has"". Paranjpe cited low per capita consumption, a large young population, a growing middle class, rising affluence and adoption of digital technology as reasons for the company's bullishness for the sector. ALSO READ: The difficulty of inflation control under our current circumstances Responding to a query on a product price increase and its impact on consumers, Paranjpe said, "" ""The reality is that when you take ingredients like palm oil, you take crude, the impacted derivative outcomes in terms of plastics, and in terms of logistics, we have seen inflation, which is in excess of 50 per cent, that's the extent of inflation that we have seen. Therefore, it is truly an unprecedented moment. As a company, we are determined to try and see how we can mitigate the impact of some of this to our consumers"". He opined HUL undertakes the price hikes in a calibrated manner and would continue to do so. Though he acknowledged that it has hurt consumers. ""I feel for the common person in the country who has to deal with this hardship at this moment and you can be certain that this company will do everything possible to contain it to the extent that we can"", he added.

Updated: 20 Jun 2022,"HUL sees weak demand, but there is some respite on margin front",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/hul-sees-weak-demand-but-there-is-some-respite-on-margin-front-11655710122911.html," Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) continues to face the double whammy of subdued demand and elevated commodity costs. But the good news is cost pressures are easing gradually as palm oil prices are falling from recent highs. This commodity and its derivatives are important ingredients in the making of soaps, biscuits and noodles. Palm oil prices have retreated below the $1,300 per tonne mark which is significantly down from the peaks of $1,800-1,900 per tonne, note analysts at Edelweiss Securities in a report on 17 June. “We are enthused by this deflation, but its sustainability remains to be seen. Recent sharp rate hikes, liquidity drying-up and risk-off bode well for commodity deflation,"" added the report. Also, the inflation in tea price has softened, which is another positive. However, crude-related inputs continue to remain high, posing headwinds for margin. As such, the margin is likely to remain under pressure for a while. In the March quarter (Q4FY22), HUL’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin had contracted by 27 basis points (bps) year-on-year (y-o-y) to 24.1%. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. Note that Ebitda margin had risen by 99bps to 25% in Q3FY22. The company aims to resort to price hikes as the last measure. It would first focus on cost savings. But there is no respite on the demand front. Analysts at Jefferies India recently met the management of HUL where the latter stated that adversities in macro environment have resulted in industry trends being muted. Though there is value growth owing to price hikes, volumes have declined. Recall that HUL had clocked flat volume growth in Q4FY22. Rural demand continues to be weak but the expectation of a normal monsoon should augur well. The company further noted that smaller unit packs are seeing higher momentum but there are no signs of downtrading. The consumer discretionary segment is more impacted due to slowdown when compared to essentials. In Q1FY23E, Edelweiss expects HUL to see volume growth of 3-4% y-o-y, largely due to a favourable base (Q1FY22 grew 9%, Q1FY21 dipped 8%). “With this, we expect about 15% revenue growth year-on-year in Q1FY23E. However, we expect margins to compress on a quarter-on-quarter/y-o-y basis,"" said Edelweiss’ analysts. Investors have acknowledged the tough business environment. While shares of HUL were more than 4% up on Monday on the National Stock Exchange, they have declined by nearly 7% so far in the calendar year 2022. During the same timeframe, the sectoral Nifty FMCG index is down 1.5%. "
Updated: 17 Jun 2022,Bombay HC rules in favour of HUL in Sebamed ad case ,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/bombay-hc-rules-in-favour-of-hul-in-sebamed-ad-case-11655443674712.html,"The Bombay High Court on Thursday granted complete relief to Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) in an advertising case against German personal care brand Sebamed. The court has restrained USV Pvt Ltd, which retails Sebamed in India, from further infringing on the brands owned by HUL and also asked it to take down the advertisements that compare the Indian company's soap brands Lux, Dove and Pears with detergent bar Rin. A detailed order in the matter is awaited. A bench led by Justice AK Menon said, “Sebamed is restrained from further infringing on the brands owned by HUL."" Additionally, the court has granted a stay of four weeks on the operation of the order. In its petition before the Bombay HC, HUL prayed that Sebamed be restrained by an order and injunction by the court from using, telecasting or broadcasting or communicating to the public any content that disparages its brand. In its petition, Sebamed had claimed that its soaps were better than HUL’s soap brands. In January 2021, fast-moving consumer goods giant HUL moved the Bombay high court against Sebamed after an aggressive advertising campaign was launched by the latter earlier comparing the Indian company’s soap brands Lux, Dove and Pears to detergent brand Rin, alleging that the beauty soaps did not maintain the optimal 5.5 pH level used for skin. However, the court, while granting an interim relief to Sebamed said that the German company cannot be allowed to continue to advertise in a manner that ‘disparages’ or ‘belittles’ the products of Hindustan Unilever. Kritika Seth, founding partner, Victoriam Legalis – Advocates & Solicitors said that “Bombay High Court made it clear that comparative marketing is an infringement of a brand’s intellectual property. If a brand has any scientific advances over any other brand regarding its products, then the focus should be on creating awareness regarding such important aspects so that a consumer can make an informed decision. Comparative marketing not only infringes the brand but also denigrates the reputation of the brand that it has built over a period of time"". In the advertisement, Sebamed claims the pH of Lux beauty soap is 10, the same as that of a Rin detergent bar – both HUL brands. SebaMed claimed the pH level of its product is 5.5, which is perfect for sensitive skin. Essentially, pH (potential hydrogen) is the metric of how acidic or basic a product is in nature. HUL in its campaign claimed that dermatologists have put something unusually strong in the Dove bar and said it has been recommended as number one by dermatologists. This was done notably without even naming Sebamed in their advertisement. The company had issued a statement saying that “HUL products and claims are backed by strong technology and underpinning science and clinical evidence and decades of expert and consumer backed testing, enjoying strong brand loyalty.""

The shares still trade lower from their IPO issue price. And the FY22 financial performance further added to its woes. So far this week, the behemoth's market cap has declined drastically and on Wednesday LIC tumbled to become the seventh most valued company with ICICI Bank overtaking the sixth spot. LIC currently is near its all-time low. On BSE, LIC shares closed in red at ₹810.55 apiece, however, flat compared to the previous closing. Its market cap stands at ₹5,12,672.69 crore. LIC floated between an intraday high and low of ₹817 apiece and ₹808.55 apiece respectively today. The shares neared their 52-week low of ₹801.55 apiece. This led LIC's market cap to decline to the seventh rank from the previous sixth position in the top ten most valued companies on exchanges. At Dalal Street, ICICI Bank surpassed LIC and bagged the sixth rank with a market cap of ₹5,23,353.87 crore. When LIC was listed on May 17, it held the fifth rank in terms of market capitalisation and since then has lost its spot to Hindustan Unilever and ICICI Bank. On Tuesday, LIC said it booked a profit of ₹42,000 crore from its investment in the stock market for the financial year FY22 - higher compared to a profit of ₹36,000 crore in FY21. While interacting with the media, Raj Kumar, managing director, LIC said that LIC is the largest asset manager in India, with assets of close to ₹42 trillion under management, besides being the largest domestic investor in the local stock market. It invests approximately 25% of its assets in Indian equities. Kumar also pointed out that LIC's fourth quarter of FY22 was not compared with the Q4 of last year as the insurer started reporting quarterly profits from the September quarter of 2021. LIC's management further said that they are conducting an exercise to calculate the Indian embedded valuation, value of a new business, and the margin of new business, which is expected to be completed by 30 June. Before the IPO, LIC's embedded valuation stood at ₹5.39 trillion. ""We are implementing a new IT solution for calculation of IEV and we need to cross-check all the data to be absolutely sure the new system is perfect, although the two previous data (September and December) were perfectly matching our liabilities,"" Kumar said. LIC registered a growth of 6.1% in the Net Premium Income at ₹4,27,419 crore for FY22 as compared to ₹4,02,844 crore in the previous fiscal. LIC's net profit for the full year stood at ₹4,043.12 crore increasing by 39.39% as against ₹2,900.57 crore in FY21. Further, in FY22, the company's Yield on Investments on policyholders' funds excluding unrealized gains was at 8.55 % as against 8.69% in FY21. The insurer's net NPAs in the policyholders' fund declined to 0.04% in FY22 as compared to 0.05% in the previous fiscal. Also, the solvency ratio for the year ended March 31, 2022, was 1.85 against 1.76 for the period ended March 31, 2021. At the IPO's upper price band of ₹949 apiece, LIC's market cap stood at ₹6,00,242 crore. However, since its debut, LIC shares and market cap have corrected sharply. Against its IPO upper price band, LIC shares have nosedived by nearly 15% as of today. While its market cap has dropped by over ₹87,569 crore against the IPO issue price. Have LIC shares become cheaper? For how long the shares will continue to be under pressure? Manish Jeloka, Co-head Products & Solutions, Sanctum Wealth said, ""The drop in Q4 net profit, lower 13th-month persistency, and lower than expected dividend payout have spooked LIC investors."" Jeloka added, ""In the run-up to the IPO and after the results, the management has reiterated its focus on increasing the share of the non-par business, improve VNB margins, arrest market share decline and focus on reducing expense ratios."" Further, Jeloka said, ""Given that LIC is such a behemoth, these changes will be at best gradual and so will be the multiple rerating. Inexpensive valuations provide a lot of comfort to LIC investors."""

Despite having a strong market presence, LIC is listed at a discount on exchanges. The real problem for LIC currently was the broader bearish market dynamic not just domestically but also globally as inflationary pressures and monetary policy tightening has unnerved the buying mood. Insurance stocks as well have followed the volatile bandwagon. On Tuesday, LIC was listed at a discount of nearly 9% to ₹867 apiece on BSE compared to the IPO upper price band of ₹949 apiece. On the debut day, LIC touched a 52-week high and low of ₹920 apiece and ₹860.10 apiece respectively. LIC's upper circuit is set at ₹1,051.50 (20%) and the lower circuit at ₹701 (20%). LIC shares are listed on BSE in the ''A'' Group Securities. Shivam Bajaj, Founder & CEO at Avener Capital said, ""Despite the reduction in the pre-IPO valuation of LIC, the scrip has still listed at a discount on the bourses which is in tandem with the diminution in insurance companies’ valuation and softness in the markets due to macro-economic constraints."" Meanwhile, Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, ""The listing price has fallen in tandem with the fall of insurance sector valuations, maintaining the discount of about 70% to the industry’s average. Positively, the stock was brought at the dip."" On Wednesday, the shares witnessed slower traction. It ended at ₹876.25 apiece almost flat compared to the previous day's closing of ₹876.25 apiece on BSE. At the current closing price, LIC holds a market valuation of ₹5,54,227.92 crore. This has made the insurer the fifth largest company on BSE in terms of market cap - surpassing the market cap of ₹5,38,209.12 crore of Hindustan Unilever (HUL). Currently, RIL is the most valued company with a market share of ₹17,17,503.33 crore followed by TCS at second place with a valuation of ₹12,62,006.82 crore, HDFC Bank at the third rank with a valuation of ₹7,29,631.10 crore and Infosys holding the fourth spot with a valuation of ₹6,35,104.25 crore. Despite the tepid listing, LIC has a decent investment opportunity going forward. Bajaj added, ""However, given the attractive fundamentals, stability in operating metrics, and expected recovery in the markets, we can potentially see some buying interest from investors."" According to Nair, ""We believe that LIC is a decent investment opportunity in the short to medium-term considering its strong market presence, improvement in future profitability due to the changes in surplus distribution norms, and strong sector growth outlook. LIC can perform well when we have a bounce in the market and positive performance in the insurance sector."" LIC had planned to raise around ₹21,000 crore from the IPO - becoming the largest ever public offer in the market. The IPO was available from May 4 to May 9. The IPO was oversubscribed by 2.95 times driven by retail, employees and policyholders. Earlier this month, Ajit Kumar Kabi analyst at LKP Research in the IPO note had explained that India’s life insurance industry is expected to grow rapidly, owing to a relatively underpenetrated market and expanding awareness, which presents a multi-year growth opportunity. LIC has been providing life insurance in India for over 65 years and is the country’s biggest life insurer, with a significant brand value advantage. There are concerns about losing market share to private players and having lower profitability and revenue growth when compared to private players. However, we believe that LIC’s distribution advantage, increasing sales mix of direct and corporate channels, and a gradual shift to high margin Non- participating products could be possible drivers for LIC’s future growth, negating lower than industry growth rates. Also, Yesha Shah, Head of Equity Research, Samco Securities had earlier said that the demographical tailwinds, a moderate penetration of life insurance in India, and a massive protection gap, will fuel the Indian life insurance industry's multi-decadal growth. LIC, being the market leader, both in terms of GWP and NBP, is poised to benefit from this growth opportunity. While the fact that LIC has been losing market share as well as it's lower than industry VNB margins do instill apprehension, LIC has indicated its plans to improve the two. The insurance behemoth aims to protect its market share through increased focus on bancassurance and enhancing direct sales of its products on its website. Further, by improving its share of non-participating products and protection plans, it aspires to improve its margins. The long-term direction of LIC’s business and financial performance does hinge on the good execution of these plans.  "

Updated: 28 Apr 2022,High inflation eats into HUL’s sales volume in March quarter,https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/high-inflation-eats-into-hul-s-sales-volume-in-march-quarter-11651085641439.html,"Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) on Wednesday reported flat quarterly sales volume as India’s largest household goods maker raised prices to offset surging input costs, crimping demand for its products. The firm said it saw further headwinds for the industry as the Russian invasion of Ukraine further fuelled already-high crude prices and food inflation. HUL’s chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director Sanjiv Mehta said consumers are “rationalizing"" spending because of inflation. Packaged consumer goods companies, including HUL, have raised product prices to offset soaring costs of raw materials such as palm oil and fuel. But the higher prices have forced consumers to cut down on consumption or buy lower-priced goods to manage household budgets, depressing demand. Retail inflation quickened to a 17-month high of 6.95% in March. HUL’s performance is seen as a proxy for broader consumer sentiment in India. The maker of Knorr soups and Lux soaps said profit rose 8.5% from a year ago to ₹2,327 crore in the three months ended 31 March, beating analysts’ estimates. A Bloomberg survey of analysts estimated the company to report a standalone profit of ₹2,203 crore.  Revenue rose 11% from a year earlier to ₹13,462 crore as it raised prices to counter high raw material prices. The company’s gross margin contracted by 3 percentage points, while the operating margin narrowed 20 basis points to 24.6% despite “very high"" inflationary headwinds, the company said. Meanwhile, underlying volume growth during the March quarter remained flat. “Commodity inflation continues to be a significant headwind for the industry. FMCG market growth has slowed down, and volumes declined in high-single-digit in the March quarter. With high inflation in food and kitchen items, consumers are titrating volumes, and essentials have been prioritized over discretionary category items. The near-term operating environment remains challenging; inflation is impacting volumes, and growth will be predominantly price-led,"" chief financial officer Ritesh Tiwari said. Tiwari said the company would continue to drive savings harder and take calibrated pricing actions while protecting and growing its consumer franchise. “Our margins will decline in the short term as price versus cost gap increases,"" he said. HUL’s top management, citing data from researcher NielsenIQ, said the packaged consumer goods industry reported value growth of 1% for the March quarter but volumes fell 8%. While NielsenIQ is yet to release its March quarter numbers, data shared by the researcher for the December quarter already pointed to high inflation hurting household consumption, especially in rural markets. The trend continued in the March quarter, partly fuelled by a milder Omicron wave that restricted mobility for part of the quarter, apart from the Ukraine crisis that triggered volatility in global commodity prices. “In the December quarter, we had seen the discretionary spends pick up; then we got into another wave of Omicron, people again went back to working from home; that again had an impact on discretionary categories,"" Sanjiv Mehta told reporters during a post-earnings call. However, as the wave receded, business in March was better than in January and February. Mehta said with prices of everything from edible oils to fuel on an upswing, consumers are rationalizing spending. “When they rationalize spends, that’s when they titrate the volume. And because the prices have gone up, the volumes titrate. And you end up with volume growth being low,"" he said. He said value growth in rural markets remained flat while volume growth was negative in the past three months. During the quarter, the company took a price hike of 10%. Analysts tracking HUL pointed to “aggressive"" price hikes by the company in categories such as home care. Mehta, however, remained firm that HUL’s focus is to grow the business faster than the market. suneera.t@livemint.com"

One, cost pressures intensified further. Two, demand outlook was gloomy. This toned down expectations from the fast-moving consumer goods company’s Q4 results. Against this backdrop, these worries did not end up having a severe impact on the financials, with HUL performing well on some counts. Elevated costs dragged gross margins down by 300 basis points (bps) year-on-year (y-o-y) to 49.5%, the lowest in the past many quarters. One basis point is 0.01%. However, an 8.7% drop in advertising and promotion expenses amply cushioned the drop at the Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) level. For perspective, HUL’s Ebitda margin contraction was curbed to just 27 bps to 24.1%. This compares with a 99 bps expansion in Ebitda margin in Q3 to 25%.        "
Updated: 25 Apr 2022,Indonesia palm oil export ban to hit packaged goods cos,https://www.livemint.com/industry/retail/indonesia-palm-oil-export-ban-to-hit-packaged-goods-cos-11650819008169.html,"NEW DELHI : Indonesia’s abrupt export ban on palm oil could disrupt supplies and drive up prices, impacting packaged consumer goods firms and consumers alike. On Friday, Indonesia announced an export ban on palm oil with effect from 28 April. The country is the world’s top palm oil producer. India imports about 8 million tonnes of palm oil annually; the commodity accounts for nearly 40% share in India’s overall edible oil consumption basket. Palm oil and its derivatives are used in producing several goods of daily consumption such as soaps, shampoos, biscuits, and noodles. Companies and industry associations flagged near-term pressure on both supplies and prices of products, including packaged foods and edible oils. “While there are a lot of unknowns, including the duration of the ban, input (on palm oil and its derivative) prices are likely to stay firm in the near term, with a potential risk to supplies as well. The unorganized sector may face severe constraint but given the tough demand environment, listed players face earning risks on demand and margins—Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL), and packaged foods have the highest exposure,"" analysts at Jefferies said in a note on Sunday. Indian consumer staples have seen high inflation and volatility in input prices. “This development would exacerbate pressures and become a key worry for HUL, GCPL, Britannia, Nestle,"" the analysts said. Parle Products Pvt. Ltd, India’s largest biscuit maker, said the move poses a big challenge for firms across the packaged consumer goods industry. “That’s not just for the food companies, but for FMCG companies at large because there are many other players beyond food firms. including those who manufacture soaps and other things. So, it’s going to be very challenging. Malaysia, the second biggest palm oil exporter, is facing a production shortfall due to a pandemic-induced labour shortage, and is unlikely to be able to plug the gap. So, the expectation was that Indonesian supplies would take care of it, but this is going to be very difficult. There are already issues with sunflower oil, because of the Ukraine-Russia situation. This is going to add to the challenges,"" said Mayank Shah, senior category head at Parle Products. In the last 12 months, palm oil prices have gone up by 50%; and nearly tripled over the last two years. Meanwhile, sunflower oil supplies and prices have remained volatile amid the Ukraine war. On Saturday, Mint reported that domestic edible oil prices are set for a surge amid Indonesia’s move to ban exports. Shah said the firm will have to figure out the real impact on prices and how it will mitigate the situation. It has concluded a round of price hikes across its portfolio. On future price hikes, he said it will wait and watch. Firms have taken a spate of price increases over the last several quarters to tide over volatile commodity prices. Key raw and packaging material prices are witnessing multi-year highs. “There will be an impact and pressure on prices for end consumers. There is clearly a demand-supply gap, this will impact prices,"" said B.V. Mehta, executive director at The Solvent Extractors’ Association of India."

(HUL) was in talks to acquire the century-old spices and condiments maker Mahashiyan Di Hatti – shortened for branding purposes to a crisp MDH – had the markets understandably agog. And not just because of the David-Goliath nature of the parties involved in the deal. After all, HUL, India’s largest FMCG brand by some margin with sales of ₹45,311 crore (in 2020-21), a workforce of over 22,000 and with a distribution network of 80 lakh stockists, dwarfs MDH, which logged ₹1,191 crore in yearly sales in 2020-21. The news has been since denied by MDH, with MDH’s current chairman Rajeev Gulati condemning “frivolous"" media reports and saying, “We are committed to take the legacy forward with all our heart.""  HUL has, notably, not said anything so far, but that is not the only reason that the buzz is refusing to die down. It is just that, in terms of a logical extension of HUL’s portfolio, MDH makes a perfect fit. And, although MDH has continued to show strong performance after the death of patriarch Mahashay Dharampal Gulati in December 2020 at the age of 97, his passing has thrown up some question marks over the future of India’s largest independent branded spices-maker. Padmabhushan Dharampal Gulati (he received India’s third-highest civilian award in 2019) was not just the face of the MDH brand – his photograph features on much of its packaging and he was the face of its hugely popular ad campaigns – he was arguably the driving force of the business, which he started with his father after the family moved over to India from Sialkot in Pakistan. In fact, in 2017, he set a record for being not only the oldest active CEO of an Indian FMCG company – he was 94 at the time – but also the highest-paid one.    "
Updated: 07 Apr 2022,Packaged goods volumes seen taking a hit,https://www.livemint.com/industry/retail/packagedgoods-volumes-seen-taking-a-hit-11649273148601.html,"NEW DELHI : High inflation and repeated price increases by packaged consumer goods companies has impacted demand as evident in lower sales volumes reported by major firms during January and February. In its March quarter update issued on Tuesday, packaged consumer goods firm Marico Ltd cited data from market researcher Nielsen and said consumption trends remained subdued for the industry amid weak rural sentiment and high commodity prices. “While companies effected price hikes across packaged consumer goods categories to cope with the cost-push, persistent inflation continued to hurt consumer wallets across rural and urban. As a result, FMCG volumes declined in the January-February 2022 period on a year-on-year basis (per Nielsen),"" it said of the industry in its update. However, the company said its India business stayed “relatively firm"", riding on execution and market share gains. “Revenue growth in the quarter was in low single digits, while volumes were marginally positive on an exceptionally high base (25%), leading to a double-digit volume growth on a 2-year CAGR basis,"" said the maker of Saffola edible oil and Parachute hair oil. On Wednesday, Mumbai-based Godrej Consumer Products Ltd said the Indian packaged consumer goods industry has witnessed a consumption slowdown over the last few months. “The sector continued to be hit hard by higher inflation levels, leading to successive price increases, and impacting volumes. Despite this, we remain competitive given the relatively non-discretionary, mass pricing of our portfolio. We have been gaining market share in 85% of our categories,"" the company said in its March quarter update filed with the exchanges. In India, the maker of Cinthol soaps expects to deliver close to double-digit sales growth, driven entirely by pricing, it said. Meanwhile, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said they expect modest growth or decline in year-on-year volumes for most consumer companies in the March quarter. The brokerage released on Wednesday its fourth-quarter earnings preview for consumer companies including those in the packaged goods, retail, and food services sectors. Among other things, Kotak highlighted deceleration in staples demand led by continued weakness in rural markets and impact of inflation and a broad-based raw material inflation that it said will weigh on profitability. “Discretionary pack would continue to outpace staples pack—we estimate three-year revenue CAGR of 7% and 14% for staples and discretionary (excluding ITC) pack, respectively,"" it said. In staples, for companies such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd., ITC Ltd, Nestle India and Marico, Kotak expects negligible or negative volume growth and mid-to-high single digit value growth largely led by price hikes. Earlier this week, in a series of reports by ICICI Securities, chief executive officers of large packaged consumer goods firms flagged moderation in volumes citing high inflation across products and commodities."

Several large FMCG companies including Hindustan Unilever Ltd., Dabur India and now P&G India, have achieved this feat. P&G India that sells brands such as Ariel washing powder as well as Head & Shoulders shampoo said it has been working with recycling partners in 75 Indian cities. The plastic waste is sent to different recyclers, waste to energy plants, and cement kilns. Meanwhile, in addition to recycling, the company has also taken steps to reduce the quantum of packaging material used in its products. In the last five years, it has lowered usage of packaging material by more than 5,000 MT. It has been stepping up efforts in its branded portfolio too. For instance, the company's liquid detergent bottles of fabric care brand Ariel are recyclable. P&G also uses recycled material in the packaging of its baby care and feminine care products, this will reduce the usage of 500 MT of virgin plastic annually, the company said. “We are proud of the significant progress we have made on environmental sustainability, and achieving ‘plastic waste neutrality’ is a key milestone in this journey. Plastic waste does not belong in the environment, and we will continue to partner with multiple stakeholders in our efforts to reduce and recycle packaging waste,"" said Madhusudan Gopalan, CEO, Procter & Gamble—Indian Sub-Continent.

As a result of this transformation the manufacturing site has been able to reduce manufacturing cost (per ton) by 39% and end-to-end product development lead time by 50%. The site has also been able to reduce quality defects by about 50%, the company said.   On the sustainability front, there has been a reduction in Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by 54% and water consumption by 31%.

Some companies are likely to be more hurt than others, and HUL’s relatively high exposure to raw materials such as palm oil, and crude oil and its derivatives makes it more vulnerable given the surge in prices following the Russia-Ukraine conflict. These concerns are reflected in the stock’s performance. HUL’s shares have declined by 16% so far in CY22 vis-à-vis a 4% drop in the Nifty FMCG index. The stock is now trading at 40 times estimated FY24 earnings, according to Bloomberg data. Valuations have corrected meaningfully but the scope for significant near-term upsides appears capped.        "

The NFO opened for subscription on March 15, 2022 and closes on March 22, 2022. As per the NSE Indices’ information about the index, the NIFTY 100 Low Volatility 30 Index aims to measure the performance of the low volatile securities in the large market capitalisation segment. The securities are selected from the NIFTY 100 index and should be available for trading in the derivatives segment (F&O). The selection of securities and their weights in NIFTY100 Low Volatility 30 is based on volatility. The volatility of the securities is calculated as the standard deviation of daily price returns for last one year. In order to make the index replicable for passive products, as per the NSE, the weightage of the stocks with turnover less than the stock having the lowest turnover in NIFTY 50, has been capped at 3%. The top constituents of the index by weightage as of February 28, 2022, are Dabur India, Britannia Industries, Nestle India, Hindustan Unilever, Tata Consultancy Services, Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, Marico, Infosys and Cipla. The entry load and exit load is nil for the scheme. The minimum investment amount is ₹5,000 and in multiples of ₹1 thereafter. The performance of the scheme is benchmarked against the Nifty 100 Low Volatility 30 Index (Total Return Index) and its fund managers are Devender Singhal, Satish Dondapati and Abhishek Bisen.

Updated: 12 Mar 2022,Inflationary headwinds could impact FMCG volumes: Report,https://www.livemint.com/industry/inflationary-headwinds-could-impact-fmcg-volumes-report-11647069066223.html,"New Delhi: Inflationary headwinds will hurt near-term profitability of large fast-moving consumer goods companies and impact volume growth in the first half of the next fiscal, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report on Friday. “The sharp rise in commodity prices led by the Russia-Ukraine conflict would weigh on profitability of most consumer companies in the near term. Further, it would impact consumption that was already showing signs of weakness especially rural demand,"" they said in a note. The brokerage revised growth estimates for consumer companies under its coverage, keeping in mind inflation in crude and palm derivatives as well as edible oils and a 5-15% inflation in select agri commodities. “We now expect flat-to-modest volume growth in 1HFY23E for most FMCG companies versus mid-single digit volume growth expectations earlier. A quick resolution of geopolitical issues and good monsoon pose upside risks to our estimates and vice versa,"" the analysts added. Companies could cut advertising and promotion spends to partially offset raw material headwinds, they said. “Incremental price increases to pass on inflation would impact volumes, companies may absorb a part of inflation in select categories to gain share from unorganized players, companies would leverage portfolio diversity and strengths,"" analysts at the brokerage added. Companies have been facing inflationary headwinds for a few quarters now, driven by the supply glut caused by the pandemic. Most companies took price hikes over the last few quarters to mitigate high inflation. However, the conflict in Ukraine has further exacerbated cost pressures. A spike in raw material costs would merit several companies to initiate incremental price increase of 4-12%; this is in addition to a similar price increase taken in 2021, according to the report. Among companies that could witness greater impact of higher input costs are those in the home and personal care segment that the brokerage said would be the “worst hit"". Select foods and beverages and quick service restaurant companies are better placed, they added. “The magnitude of demand destruction due to inflation would vary across categories. Within our coverage universe, Godrej Consumer Products, Hindustan Unilever Ltd., and paints companies are most impacted, while Dabur, Marico, Nestle, Britannia and ITC will be moderately impacted,"" the said. Rise in prices of glass bottles and cans as well as wheat and barley would impact profitability of alcoholic beverages companies. The extent of impact on liquor makers would depend on the quantum and timing of price increases which rests on hinges on state approvals. Titan Company does not face any direct risk but volatility in gold prices can defer demand in the short term, they added."
Updated: 11 Mar 2022,What Colgate’s new CEO hire means for its Indian business,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/what-colgate-s-new-ceo-hire-means-for-its-indian-business-11647017788750.html,"An appointment of a new chief executive officer at Colgate India is usually a non-event. Usually, but not always, the US-based maker of toothpaste and personal care products elevates managers from within to the leadership position in India. Departing from the norm, the company has announced the appointment of Prabha Narasimhan as the new MD and CEO of the company. She comes from rival Hindustan Unilever (HUL), India’s biggest consumer company, where she successfully generated profitable growth in the home and personal care categories. Although, this is not the first time Colgate has hired from HUL—it earlier poached Mukul Deoras, who is now the chairman of the Indian subsidiary and heads the Asia Pacific division for Colgate—what’s interesting this time round is Narasimhan’s extensive experience in the home and personal care categories. The HUL website lauds her for her leadership in delivering a market-beating growth rate in Unilever’s skincare business. In 2020, she was moved to the home care category. Oral care falls in the personal care segment in HUL, but the profile has no previous leadership positions highlighted for Narasimhan in the area. That’s what about this appointment is likely to stir investors’ interest the most. For a change at the top usually also means a change for the business. A CEO appointment tends to be a strategic management change. Therefore, the background of the new CEO offers insights into a company’s strategy for the future. Shareholders track such appointments closely to get a sort of a peek into the future.   "
Updated: 11 Mar 2022,Colgate Vs Godrej: A tale of two CEO hires,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/colgate-vs-godrej-a-tale-of-two-ceo-hires-11646994170490.html,"Shares of Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd. were unchanged on Friday on the National Stock Exchange after it announced a change of guard at the company. Colgate has named Prabha Narasimhan as its new managing director and chief executive officer (MD and CEO) effective 1 September. Prima facie, Colgate’s investors’ response widely contrasts with the euphoria seen in May last year when Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. (GCPL) had said Sudhir Sitapati will be appointed MD and CEO. Recall that GCPL’s shares had risen 22% following the notification on 12 May to nearly ₹873 apiece. Sachin Bobade, analyst Dolat Capital Market Pvt. Ltd, said, ""In GCPL’s case, the stock did trace back to its initial levels post the heavy reaction to the leadership change. The market seems to be factoring this, which could explain the muted reaction of the Colgate stock on the change in leadership.""  Further, investors may have anticipated relatively higher growth opportunities in the categories GCPL operates in following the change. Not only that, Nisaba Godrej, who occupied the MD’s office prior to Sitapati, is part of the promoter group and as such the change in leadership would have come as a relief because investors tend to worry about concentration of power. As things stand, GCPL’s shares now trade at ₹710, partly bogged down by higher palm oil prices of late. Also, in general, sentiments towards FMCG stocks have been subdued recently due to elevated input cost pressures along with weak rural demand conditions. Even so, leadership changes in FMCG companies are typically viewed as exciting. CEO changes at Britannia Industries Ltd, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), and Dabur India Ltd. in the past suggest that a new leader could drive significant shareholder value. “To be sure, a change in leadership can actually change the dynamics for Colgate. If the new CEO focuses on enhancing distribution, more advertising campaigns, and new launches it may boost volumes and growth, eventually,"" says Bobade. Narasimhan brings more than two decades of experience in various categories across consumer marketing and development roles. In her last role, she served as executive director of Home Care at HUL.  “With market-share gains limited due to elevated competitive intensity (largely from the ayurvedic/naturals segment and HUL stepping up new launches with new formulations), we believe a fresh perspective from outside the industry can bring in cross-pollination of fresh ideas and strategies from other consumer categories,"" said analysts at Nomura in a report on 10 March. In particular, Colgate’s market share decline and muted revenue growth has been a concern. “The combination of sharp decline in market share in recent years and the increased penetration of the category itself have resulted in single-digit topline growth over the last 10 years. In recent years, premiumization has also come off, affecting realization growth (v/s the past),"" said analysts from Motilal Oswal Financial Services in their Q3FY22 review report.  The brokerage added, “For a company with a modest base of ₹2,040 crore in sales in FY10, a sales/Ebitda/PBT CAGR of 8–10% over the last 10 years is a weak result."" CAGR is compounded annual growth rate. The bright spot, however, is that valuations are undemanding. Colgate’s stock trades at 36 times FY23 estimated earnings, Bloomberg data shows. However, near-term scope for meaningful upsides appears limited. “Colgate is entering a low-growth period with the absence of any sustainable triggers to drive incremental growth. We await details of any new strategies from incoming CEO Ms. Narasimhan before turning constructive,"" added the Nomura report."
Updated: 11 Mar 2022,Colgate hires former HUL exec Prabha Narasimhan as India CEO,https://www.livemint.com/companies/prabha-narasimhan-set-to-take-over-as-colgate-palmolive-india-ceo-and-md-11646918776938.html,"NEW DELHI : Oral care company Colgate-Palmolive (India) Limited on Thursday announced the appointment of former Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) executive Prabha Narasimhan as its managing director and chief executive officer replacing Ram Raghavan who is set to move to a global role.  In a filing to the exchanges on Thursday—the maker of Colgate toothpaste and Palmolive hand wash said the nomination and remuneration committee of the Board of Directors approved that effective 16th April, 2022, Ram Raghavan, managing director and CEO of the company has been promoted to president, enterprise oral care, for Colgate Palmolive Company. Raghavan will be based out of the company’s headquarters in New York.  The company also announced the appointment of Prabha Narasimhan as managing director and chief executive officer of Colgate-Palmolive (India) Limited effective from September 1, 2022.  Narasimhan becomes the first outside managing director of the company in the last 12 years, analysts said.  Narasimhan has over two decades of experience across consumer marketing insights, customer development and marketing roles in multiple geographies and across multiple categories including beauty, personal care and refreshments. In her last role—Narasimhan was executive director, home care for Hindustan Unilever Limited and vice president, home care, Unilever, South Asia. Narasimhan joined HUL in 2006.   Narasimhan is a graduate of Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Bangalore. She joins the league of former HUL executives who’ve moved on to head large consumer products businesses.   Last year—Mumbai-based FMCG company Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) announced the appointment of Sudhir Sitapati as its managing director and chief executive officer effective. Sitapati was the former executive director, foods and refreshments at HUL. Executives from HUL’s India business have also moved to top global roles within the wider Unilever ecosystem.  According to HUL’s website—under Narasimhan's leadership of the skin care business delivered a market-beating growth rate between 2016-19.  This was enabled by a broad-based performance delivery across all brands and sub-segments – colours business delivering high double-digit growth during the entire tenure, strengthening of our flagship brand Glow & Lovely and entry into newer skin care segments. Narasimhan moved to the home care role in early 2020.  Analysts tracking the company welcomed the move.   “Narasimhan could be a great hire for Colgate India to further scale up aggression in oral care—especially get back market share from Dabur, Patanjali and have a larger play in naturals and scale up the Palmolive brand,"" said Abneesh Roy, Executive Director, Institutional Equities, Edelweiss Securities. Roy said this shows renewed aggression by the company to try new initiatives.   “We are seeing a marked scale up in new launches (premium toothpastes, smart brushes) by Colgate in the past few quarters. Colgate is going through a paradigm shift to premiumize, moving from oral care to oral beauty. It is now expanding the Palmolive range, it is building a second growth driver (face care lines),"" he added.  In fiscal 2021 the company reported total revenue of ₹4,871.56 crore with a profit of ₹1,035.38 crore. In India the company sells—oral care and personal care products such as body wash, toothpaste, hand sanitizers, toothbrush, body wash and mouth sprays.  "
Updated: 09 Mar 2022,Rural markets are showing no signs of easing stress,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/rural-markets-are-showing-no-signs-of-easing-stress-11646846083833.html,"For two consecutive quarters, research and analytics firm NielsenIQ has been flagging signs of demand moderation in rural markets. These were captured both in its September quarter (2021) report on the performance of packaged consumer goods companies and again in the December quarter snapshot of the sector released on 2 March. For the September quarter, it spoke of a 2.9% year-on-year volume decline in India’s villages as people purchased less or bought cheaper cooking oils and personal care products. But the sector reported value growth led by demand in big cities and price increases taken to mitigate higher input costs. ITC Ltd, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Britannia Industries Ltd, Parle Products Pvt. Ltd, among others, increased prices of soaps, detergents, tea and biscuits. December quarter, too, shows a 2.6% year-on-year fall in packaged consumer goods volumes. Bearing the brunt of price increases, the consumption slowdown was more accentuated in rural markets at 4.8%, while urban markets declined by 0.8%. February’s Union budget did little to lift consumption as it did not reduce direct taxes or increase allocation towards rural job guarantee schemes. In fact, it cut back on the allocation for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, which had helped many rural households during the last two years of the pandemic. Rajat Wahi, a partner at Deloitte India, attributes the rural slowdown numbers also to the base rate effect due to Q4 ‘20 and Q1 ‘21 being very strong quarters coming out of the lockdown. “It was also the time when a lot of labour had moved back home, and that drove up consumption in rural markets backed by government support,"" he said. Additionally, pressure on rural demand is due to the price hikes taken by packaged consumer goods firms owing to inflationary pressures, he said. “Overall inflation due to fuel price hike is impacting prices of fertilisers, cooking oils, etc., forcing rural consumers to trade down and hold back consumption,"" he said. Besides, the bigger impact of second and third wave in rural markets forced rural consumers to make provisions for medical expenses. Angshu Mallick, chief executive and managing director of Adani Wilmar Ltd, which sells Fortune brand edible oils, agreed that price increase has resulted in consumption slowdown, especially in rural markets. “Categories like staples have seen a high price increase in last two quarters, leading to larger price growth in rural markets and, hence impacting the volumes,"" he said. Mallick said as per Nielsen RMS Data of December quarter, consumer packed oil in the 0-5 litres category in rural India has seen a 5.1% decline while packaged atta (wheat flour) category remained flat in the same period. The increase in prices has led the consumers to go back to small pack sizes, he said. To revive rural markets, household income needs to be driven up, said Wahi. This could be done by pushing through the schemes that the government announced, such as technology implementation for farming, building roads, expanding the railways, pushing employment schemes as these could provide more jobs and income for rural consumers. The Ukraine-Russia conflict is expected to further fuel inflation and depress demand. However, Wahi doesn’t think that geopolitical factors will have a major impact on rural consumption other than supply chain shortages that may impact raw material pricing. But Ajay Sharma, senior vice president of the rural business division at Usha International, who has seen his sales improve in rural India in the last two years, said the global unrest may have depressed buyer sentiment. “While the effect was more on packaged consumer goods, consumer durables still being a developing market were little less affected barring in the East which saw a downward trend owing to the lower cost of rice crop."" Usha sells a range of products, including fans, coolers, and home appliances. Though he expects sales in the rural markets to revive, Sharma warns of geopolitical tensions, the outcome or impact of which cannot be predicted right now. “One can only wait and watch to see how it really pans out and what impact it will have on the oil prices and inflation as these two factors would impact the demand and consumer sentiments across markets,"" he added. Shuchi Bansal is Mint’s media, marketing and advertising editor. Ordinary Post will look at pre-ssing issues related to all three. Or just fun stuff."
Updated: 04 Mar 2022,HUL launches public awareness campaign to promote waste segregation,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/hul-launches-public-awareness-campaign-to-promote-waste-segregation-11646390630134.html,"NEW DELHI : Packaged consumer goods company Hindustan Unilever Ltd., has launched a campaign to promote effective waste-management solutions in the country. The ‘Bin Boy’ campaign through its child protagonist ‘Appu,’ aims to drive behaviour change among citizens and urge them to segregate waste at homes and residential societies, the maker of Dove soaps and Kissan jams said in a statement on Friday.  The campaign wants to inspire individuals to segregate household waste at source and ensure that waste stays out of the environment and in the circular economy, the company said. “The need for urgent action on the issue of waste segregation has never been greater. At HUL, we recognize our role in this context and have been working with leading agencies in the space and the Government to drive what is a simple, positive action that each of us could do. We work towards empowering communities to reach the goal of swachhata and a zero-waste circular economy. Children are the strongest advocates of change in society and are also the strongest drivers,"" said Sanjiv Mehta, Chairman and Managing Director, Hindustan Unilever Ltd. The film shows a protesting child, Appu, sitting on an unsorted heap of waste in a household dustbin refusing to get out. Appu’s refusal to step out surprises those around him. The child is then seen making a plea to those around him urging them to sort garbage waste into wet and dry. The corporate campaign comes at a time when HUL has already achieved 100% plastic waste collection. HUL has partnered the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for end-to-end waste management projects in Mumbai, right from collection to segregation and recycling, including behaviour change. HUL said it also aims to uplift the lives of more than 3000 waste-pickers and their families with better access to government’s social protection schemes covering – food, health, safety, security, and financial inclusion through Project Utthan."

Updated: 01 Mar 2022,"Hindustan Unilever raises prices a second time in Feb, this time by 1-9%",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/hindustan-unilever-takes-1-9-price-hike-11646048963710.html,"NEW DELHI : India’s largest packaged consumer goods company Hindustan Unilever Ltd. has taken further price hikes in February across stock keeping units of brands such as Surf Excel Matic, Comfort fabric conditioner, Dove body wash, apart from Lifebuoy, Lux and Pears soaps. On Monday, brokerage Edelweiss Securities said that as per its channel checks, prices have gone up across HUL’s home and personal care category in the range of 1—9%. This is the second round of price hikes initiated by the fast-moving consumer goods company in the month of February. “As per our channel checks Hindustan Unilever has taken one more round of price hike in February. Our channel checks suggest latest price hikes have happened in many SKUs of Surf Excel Matic, Comfort Fabric conditioner, Dove body wash, Lifebuoy, Lux and Pears soaps, and Rin,"" Abneesh Roy, Executive Director, Institutional Equities, Edelweiss Securities said. Two weeks ago, Hindustan Unilever had taken 3-10% price hike in soaps, detergents, and dish washing products. This was across its Surf Excel Easy Wash detergent, Surf Excel Quick Wash, Vim bar and liquid as well as Lux and Rexona soaps and Ponds Talcum powder. Companies typically take price hikes in a staggered manner—instead of a one-time price increase across their entire portfolio. HUL sells products across a range of categories including beauty and personal care, food and refreshments, and household care. In the December quarter, the company reported an underlying volume growth of 2%; sales were up 10.4% year-on-year. Price hikes, to offset input price pressure, drove revenue growth to double digits. Persistent inflation across key commodities has been pushing companies to take multiple rounds of price increases. With price of crude oil moving up amid the Ukraine-Russia conflict escalated, analysts reckon inflationary pressures are here to stay. Price increases will help the company overcome incremental inflation, said Roy. “Important to note that HUL takes price hikes in a staggered manner based on view on raw material prices, competition and a portfolio approach. With crude near $100, these price hikes will help overcome incremental inflation,"" analysts said. Email queries sent to HUL remained unanswered. In an earnings call after the company’s December quarter results—HUL’s top management said that with the significant inflation persisting in crude and its derivatives, the company continued with calibrated pricing actions in both fabric wash and household care. A calibrated approach towards price increase in skin cleansing and hair care helped protect the company's business model, even as vegetable oils continue to inflate at record levels. Roy said HUL enjoys high pricing power due to expansion in market share. The company reported its highest year-on-year share gains in more than a decade, it said in its December quarter earnings."

With the festival of colours fast approaching, Surf Excel , the firm said, wanted to keep people's inner child alive through the new commercial. The campaign goes live across TV and outdoor media from 1st March and has been made by Carlos Creatives. Prabha Narasimhan, executive director, home care for the company said, “This year we wanted to steer our ‘Daag Achhe Hain’ towards bringing the inner child within each of us to life, and experiencing the joy of child-like abandon. With our latest television campaign we aim to strike an emotional chord in a slice-of-life context that appeals to every adult. While the context in the film is that of Holi, the message is an all-pervasive one. We hope our consumers connect with it as much as we did while conceptualising it."" The campaign shows a young girl, including her aunt, in celebration along with other children. In the film, the child protagonist is playing with her friends with colours when she notices her aunt wanting to join, but is busy setting the table. The protagonist insists that her aunt join them, but she moves away, saying it’s not her age to play like them. However, the girl covers herself with colours and hugs her aunt transferring the imprint as the message plays - “Jo Rang Bachpan Lautaye, Woh Rang Achhe Hain''. The company said growing older comes with responsibilities, and it also comes with preconceived notions of acting one's age, and what they should or should not be doing, in order to fit into the propriety structures. However, people occasionally find themselves spontaneously reminded of the days of climbing trees, splashing in rain puddles, or hiding colours in our pockets to stealthily include someone into our Holi celebrations. It is moments of letting the inner child in spontaneous abandon that makes lives fuller.  According to ReportLinker, the India detergents market was valued at ₹42,827.4 crore in 2019 and is projected to reach ₹73,660.4 crore by 2027, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7% from 2020 to 2027."

Updated: 01 Feb 2022,Inflation impacts rural consumption of FMCG in December quarter,https://www.livemint.com/industry/retail/inflation-impacts-rural-consumption-of-fmcg-in-december-quarter-11643657090048.html,"NEW DELHI : Top packaged consumer goods companies, including Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), Marico, and Britannia flagged slowing rural demand in the December quarter as rising inflation hurt the ability of consumers to buy goods of daily use.  The slowdown in growth also came on a high base quarter, Marico said. “It’s a combination of two things. First, obviously, there’s an optical one, because we had a very high base. Second, whenever there is high inflation, especially if there is a food inflation, the share of wallet towards fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), perhaps swings a bit. There is also risk of down trading,"" Saugata Gupta, managing director and chief executive officer, Marico Ltd, said during the company’s post-earnings call on Friday.  The maker of Parachute hair oil reported a 1.6% increase in December quarter profit at ₹317 crore. The company reported flat volume growth in its India business during the quarter. Overall FMCG market volumes witnessed a drop in the December quarter, with rural visibly lagging urban, the company said.  Both rural and urban markets reported negative volume growth for FMCG in the December quarter with rural leading the drop in volumes, HUL said in its earnings presentation for the quarter, citing industry data from researcher Nielsen. Value growth in rural markets was down compared with urban markets year-on-year.  Deceleration in rural growth was visible in the three months ended 31 December, HUL said. “We had cautioned about rural growth in our September quarter earnings call and we do see the deceleration taking hold. With very high levels of inflation that consumers are witnessing, volumes in market have declined and this decline is more accentuated in the rural markets and in those categories that have been impacted more by the commodity inflation,"" Sanjiv Mehta, chairman and managing director, said during the company’s earnings call on 20 January.  Rural contributes 38% to sales of FMCG.  Analysts tracking the FMCG sector said the rural slowdown is “definitely concerning"". Abneesh Roy, executive vice president, institutional equities, Edelweiss Securities, pointed to heightened inflation that he said is squeezing household budgets.  “There has been a huge cost inflation for farmers. Pesticides prices, diesel prices, all are highly inflationary. The government has cut duty on petrol and diesel, which has helped a bit, but there is general inflation…because fertilizer, diesel, and transport costs have been eating up disposable incomes,"" Roy said.  “We’ve been able to buck the trend and keep our rural agenda moving forward,"" Varun Berry, managing director at biscuit maker Britannia Industries Ltd, said in a post earnings call on Monday. The company doubled its market share growth in rural pockets during the quarter on the back of deep distribution coverage. “We’ve seen no slowdown as far as rural is concerned...Our market share growth in rural is two times what it is in urban,"" Berry told investors on Monday.  Roy said large companies are also winning market share in key categories as smaller players face the brunt of rising costs. Market leaders are gaining because whenever there’s sharp inflation smaller players are not able to manage the working capital and their margins are wafer thin, he said.  Companies are now pinning their hope on the government to help lift rural demand. “We’re hoping that the government is cognizant of it and we expect support in rural reforms to continue and if monsoon and the sowing season is good, this will ease off,"" Gupta said."
Updated: 26 Jan 2022,Nitin Paranjpe is chief people officer at Unilever,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/unilever-names-nitin-paranjpe-as-chief-transformation-officer-and-chief-people-officer-11643112647629.html,"NEW DELHI : Consumer goods company Unilever Plc on Tuesday said it will slash 1,500 management positions globally as part of an organizational shakeup and appointed chief operating officer Nitin Paranjpe as its chief transformation officer and chief people officer. The company employs 149,000 people worldwide. In India, Sanjiv Mehta, chairman and managing director, will continue to lead the business at its local arm Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL). Unilever said it will focus on five business divisions—beauty and well-being, personal care, home care, nutrition, and ice-cream. Responding to Mint’s query on the India business, a company spokesperson said HUL has a mutually beneficial relationship with the Unilever Group. “India has been and continues to be one of the three top priority markets for Unilever. We will continue to have executive leadership of Sanjiv Mehta, chairman and managing director, under the supervision and guidance of the HUL board. We have a mutually beneficial and interdependent relationship with Unilever Group, bringing the best of trends, innovations and capabilities to the Indian market. We will continue to leverage this organization structure to serve our consumers and customers even better. Changes, if any, will be announced in due course,"" the spokesperson said. Unilever announced these measures in a bid to ease shareholder concerns. Shares at Unilever have fallen about 13% over the past year, according to a report by Reuters. The company recently made an unsuccessful bid for GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer healthcare business. HUL is the largest pure-play fast-moving consumer goods company in India, selling everything from detergents to soaps. It employed 21,000 people and had a turnover of ₹45,311 crore in 2020-21. Its products are sold in over 8 million outlets in the country. Paranjpe—a former chief executive officer of HUL, India and executive vice-president for Unilever, South Asia—will lead the company’s business transformation and head the human rights function, the company said. The organizational model has been developed over the last year, said Alan Jope, chief executive officer, Unilever. “The model is designed to continue the step-up we are seeing in the performance of our business,"" he said. “Moving to five category-focused business groups will enable us to be more responsive to consumer and channel trends, with crystal-clear accountability for delivery. Growth remains our top priority and these changes will underpin our pursuit of this,"" said Jope. The proposed new organization model will result in a reduction in senior management roles of around 15% and junior management roles by 5%, equivalent to around 1,500 roles globally, the company said. Unilever also announced changes to its leadership team, including the appointment of Fernando Fernandez, executive vice-president, Latin America, as president, beauty and well being; Fabian Garcia, president, North America, has been appointed president of personal care, responsible for skin cleansing, deodorants, and oral care. Hanneke Faber, president of foods and refreshment, has been appointed president of the company’s nutrition business, among other changes. Other members of the Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE) will continue in their roles."

Updated: 17 Jan 2022,All eyes on rural demand in  FMCG  firms’  Q3  results,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/all-eyes-on-rural-demand-infmcgfirmsq3results-11642355459787.html,"Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) will announce its December quarter (Q3FY22) results on Thursday and investors are expected to closely track management commentary on rural demand. Recall that while announcing Q2 results, HUL had said recent industry trends hint at rural demand moderation, which need to be monitored. Q3 volume growth expectations are sequentially lower, but product price increases would likely support revenue growth. “Expect 9% revenue growth (for HUL), which would be pricing-led with volume growth lagging at 2%,"" said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd. As other fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies declare their Q3 results, investors can expect a similar theme of subdued volume growth and higher pricing to play out. Aggregate sector revenue growth is expected to be lower sequentially. “HPC & Foods’ (FMCG firms) volume growth rates have visibly slowed (JM Financial estimates 1-2% versus 5% in Sep-Q), with some offset from higher pricing to pass-on some commodity costs pressure,"" said analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd. “While this leads to revenue growth deceleration in staples, two-year CAGR may not be too different versus (Q2) due to higher price component,"" the brokerage said. CAGR is compound annual growth rate. Marico Ltd is expected to be one of the best performers on revenue growth. In its pre-quarter update, it said Q3 consolidated revenue growth was in the low teens. Marico’s December quarter domestic volumes are expected to be flat year-on-year (y-o-y) versus an 8% growth in Q2. On two-year revenue CAGR, both Marico and Dabur India Ltd are expected to perform relatively better than peers. Nestle India Ltd could sustain double-digit growth, even as raw material inflation dents margins, according to Jefferies’ analysts. The brokerage expects 8% y-o-y revenue growth for Britannia Industries Ltd, which would largely be pricing-led even as volumes remain flat. On the profitability front, continued commodity inflation could compress y-o-y gross margins, though sequential performance is likely to improve. Savings in advertising and promotion spends may help net profit. Overall, management commentary on demand conditions, especially rural market; margin prospects and price hikes are key factors to track. Meanwhile, FMCG stock valuations have corrected from their highs in keeping with demand worries. Bloomberg data shows that shares of HUL, Dabur India, Britannia, and Marico trade at 52.8 times, 47 times, 45.4 times, and 42 times each of their FY23 estimated earnings, respectively. In the near-term, the Omicron coronavirus variant poses a threat and some regions have imposed curbs to contain its spread. In general, analysts expect the FMCG sector to see consistent recovery over 2022, supported by minimal potential impediments due to covid-19. “While we are witnessing a covid surge, consumer behaviour shifts are no longer as dramatic as in the first two waves. The only impact we see are for (1) HUL’s personal care business, which could again see a slowdown as consumer mobility falls, and (2) Dabur’s healthcare business, which could see strong growth in consumption in this phase,"" said analysts from Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a report last week. How rural demand shapes up remains key. Gross margin pressures would continue for a while until input prices soften meaningfully, analysts said. These factors may keep investors cautious on FMCG stocks in the near future. “While staple companies face weak earnings outlook in the near term, FY23 could be a year of turnaround,"" said Jefferies’ analysts."
Updated: 04 Jan 2022,Choices for striking FMCG distributors: To be creative or self-destructive,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/choices-for-striking-fmcg-distributors-to-be-creative-or-selfdestructive-11641298725125.html,"In about 10 years between the first and second decades of the 20th century, automobiles completely replaced horses and horse-drawn carriages in New York City. It is entirely plausible that cartwrights, who made the carriages, smiths, who made the horseshoes and metallic parts of the carriages, livery stable workers, suppliers of oats and hay for the horses, the workers whose job it was to clean up the mess the thousands of horses deposited on the streets of the city everyday, and sundry others, felt aggrieved by the technological paradigm shift that had made their jobs redundant. Some might have protested. But the cars continued to roll out, in greater numbers, ever more powerful and ever more affordable. Horses were reduced to quaint showpieces from the past.  The distributors who threaten to boycott Hindustan Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive because these companies offer larger discounts than what they give the distributors to newfangled organised trade would do well to consider this bit of history. The distributors’ pain is real, their plaint, valid; but without a solution, given the unstoppable march of technology. They have to adapt, not try to return to streets piled ankle-deep in horseshit. Large e-commerce platforms and new B2B players, the likes of Udaan, Elasticrun, Jumbotail, and cash-and-carry players such as Walmart Best Price, Metro Cash- and-Carry and JioMart, who now compete with the traditional distributors to supply the kiranas, the retail stores from which customers buy their requirements of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), are creating a fundamental shift in the business of distribution. They are shortening the supply chain and making it more efficient. Agitational techniques on the part of the traditional distributors cannot stop the disruption. Right now, the traditional mode of distribution accounts for about 85% of the volume, but things can change rapidly. It took about 10 years for horse carriages to vanish from New York City.    "
Updated: 30 Dec 2021,HUL products could go missing in Maharashtra as distributor pressure mounts,https://www.livemint.com/industry/retail/hul-products-could-go-missing-in-maharashtra-as-distributor-pressure-mounts-11640860074537.html,"New Delhi: FMCG distributors have pledged to stop selling select products of packaged goods major Hindustan Unilever Ltd. in Maharashtra, citing concerns over the company's inability to engage in a dialogue with them over price disparity between traditional distributors and organized business-to-business distributors. Maharashtra is a key market for the maker of Dove shampoo and Bru coffee. Queries sent by Mint to HUL over distributors' non-co-operation did not elicit a response. The move comes as All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation or AICPDF—an industry body that represents dealers and distributors of fast-moving consumer goods companies -- has been urging FMCG companies to address issues faced by offline distributors on account of business-to-business companies such as JioMart, Walmart, Metro Cash and Carry, Booker, Elasticrun and Udaan. In all, AICPDF wrote to 24 FMCG companies. The federation has met three companies, conversations are on with 8-9 more companies and these have acknowledged the problems faced by distributors, said Dhairyashil Patil, national president, AICDF. Some companies such as HUL and Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd., said AICPDF, have not yet acknowledged the federation’s demand. The association could take similar action against Colgate Palmolive, Patil said. The federation that represents over 4,00,000 distributors and stockists has sought pricing parity and similar margins that are offered to organized business-to-business distributors. The federation claims that new-age players are distorting the traditional distribution system by dumping similar products at lower prices to end retailers. Mint had earlier reported that AICPDF’s protests could spill over to the next year as meetings with companies are still ongoing. Some FMCG companies have reiterated their faith in traditional trade channels but added that they would continue to engage with new channels to drive business. HUL’s lack of response is a major concern for distributors, AICPDF representatives said. In the first leg, they will stop supplying HUL’s Kissan fruit jams and ketchups to retail stores in Maharashtra starting 1 January, and then move to HUL’s beauty and cosmetics portfolio including brands such as Glow & Lovely, over the next 8-10 days in the absence of any communication from the company. It will subsequently stop supplying Rin detergent bars in the state. “Dialogue is very important—irrespective of the resolution it just shows that they don't care what the distributor is worried about. This could mean they have reservations or have high-stakes involved in the system,"" said Patil. The federation has written and communicated with HUL multiple times, Patil said. “We are not against the company or disrupt the supply chain—we just want to tell them that we are in distress and they need to speak to us and figure out a solution. We are not in a state of war, we want to be heard--whatever the solution,"" he said. In a note on the matter, brokerage Edewlweiss said that it does not expect the distributor boycott to have a significant impact on HUL as shops and consumers can easily buy from online and organised players. “Important to note that HUL now services 15% of its demand digitally, which is a significant advantage (but wasn’t so a few years ago). HUL dominates most categories and has a strong consumer-pull,"" it said. In a response to Mint, an HUL spokesperson said its arrangements with distributor partners are ‘not exclusive’.  ""We sell and distribute our products across all channels such as General Trade, Modern Trade, eCom, Cash & Carry B2B etc to make it convenient for our shoppers & consumers to buy our trusted brands. However, based on shopper buying habits, channel structures and cost of operations the assortment offered could be different. As channels evolve, we will continue to take up new initiatives with an objective to help scale up business for our Distributors and to strengthen our distribution,"" it said. The company said that general trade continues to be its largest channel and its distributors (redistribution stockists) are and will remain its valued partners.  ""We remain fully committed to ensuring that our distributors earn a fair return on their investments and in enhancing capabilities in our GT network. We have taken several actions such as deploying technology for order placements through India’s largest eB2B app, Shikhar and in supporting our Distributors to increase their direct reach. We have also introduced specially tailored programmes with reputed academic Institutions to help them hone their business skills and become future-ready,"" it added.  HUL has a long-standing relationship with its distributors that is based on trust and mutuality of interest, the spokesperson said. ""Our distributors have overwhelmingly conveyed to us that they will rebuff any attempts to create a wedge between the Company and our trusted distributors,"" the spokesperson added. "

Industry body All-India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF) held meetings last week in Delhi with companies such as Nestle India and ITC. In the meetings, FMCG companies reiterated their faith in traditional trade channels but added that they would continue to engage with new channels to drive growth.

Rural markets fared well, growing ahead of urban markets, in the aftermath of the pandemic. However, growth now seems to be cooling off. Meanwhile, growth in urban markets has seen steady recovery post the second wave with modern trade also seeing a comeback. On a two-year basis, volumes in rural market would still be ahead of pre-covid levels, the brokerage said in its note on demand for fast moving consumer goods in rural India. ""We do expect a decent recovery in FY23 rural volumes for most consumer companies,"" it added. Hindustan Unilever Ltd. was the first company to highlight a possible rural slowdown. Others such as Marico and Dabur too cautioned about rural growth. Even so, most companies feel this is transitory, attributing it primarily to a high base, sharp price hikes and grammage cuts, a dip in wallet share due to broad-based inflation, and uneven monsoon and delay in winter, the report added. However, the brokerage said the shortfall due to rural slowdown would be ""largely compensated"" by a recovery in urban demand. ""Longer term, we expect rural growth to be robust and ahead of urban. The major reasons we think FY23 rural outlook is better for larger consumer companies are rural per capita consumption of FMCG is about one-third of urban India; monsoon has been decent for most part of country; companies are expanding direct reach in rural areas, apart from adding lower unit packs at attractive price points,"" it added."

The shares have fallen by 12% since results of its September quarter were announced on 19 October. While HUL’s quarterly volume performance was disappointing, another factor that hurt sentiments for the stock is the management’s comments on some softening in rural demand. HUL said while its own Q2 rural growth was decent, recent trends suggested demand moderation, which needs to be monitored in the coming months. Analysts reckon any rural slowdown is a red flag from a growth perspective for HUL. Be that as it may, it is not as if the performance for the six months to 30 September has been stellar. The company has had to cope with rising raw material (RM) prices and somewhat muted performance in its discretionary segments.      "
