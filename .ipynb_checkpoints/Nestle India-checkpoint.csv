The Nifty ended 3% lower month-on-month (MoM) in May 2022 as the stock registered the second consecutive month of a decline. However, the Nifty has remained resilient in CY22 year-to-date (YTD) despite multiple headwinds as strong DIIs flows continue.   India’s ruling party has been thrown into prompt damage control mode as the country’s diplomatic envoys faced music over the weekend from key West Asian trading partners over alleged anti-Prophet remarks by a spokesperson during a TV debate.

Multibagger stock: Amid highly volatile stock market today, Adani Power share price hit upper circuit in Monday's morning deals.

The deployment of 10,000 units makes this the biggest ever EV fleet order in India, the auto major said in a statement.   Rating: BUY | CMP: Rs251 | TP: Rs344 We attended the analyst meet of Oil India (OINL). Management guided strong volume growth FY25E to be a watershed year, driven by commissioning of major oil and gas expansion along with Numaligarh Refinery’s (NRL) expansion projects. Some key highlights are 1) Oil and gas production to increase by 30% and 70% respectively post completion of major projects in Assam 2) NRL refinery’s expansion to 9MTPA from current 3MTPA to come on stream by FY25E 3) No imposition of windfall taxes after two years of depressed profits and 4) No price cap on gas prices. OINL is well placed to benefit from rising oil and gas prices and high GRMs and FY25E EBIDTA can increase to Rs210bn (FY22-Rs105bn) on higher volumes. We maintain our estimates and retain ‘BUY’ with a PT of Rs344 based on 3.5x EV/E FY24E.   We maintain our ADD rating with a revised target price of Rs367/unit and at CMP of Rs349/unit, we estimate NDCF yield of 5.8% in FY23E and 6.2% in FY24E (over 90% tax-free returns). Key risks to our call are further rise in vacancies across assets and fall in lease rentals.   Kolte-Patil Developers Limited (KPDL), a leading Pune-based real estate developer with expanding operations in Mumbai and Bengaluru, has partnered with India's largest EV charging solutions provider, Tata Power, to install charging stations across its projects in Pune, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, providing comprehensive charging solutions to EV owners.   Multibagger stock: Investing in penny stocks is quite risky but high risk-traders prefer to invest in such low float stocks as well. However, they invest in the penny stock after gathering proper information instead of gambling. According to market magnets, investing in stock is like investing in business. So, irrespective of size of the business, one needs to check investment viability of a stock on same parameter and if the answer coming out from the balance sheet of the company is satisfactory, then one can think of investing even in a penny stock as penny stocks deliver whopping return in short term.   Multiplex stocks were under pressure on Monday as covid cases started to rise again in India with the country reporting record weekly Covid-19 cases in three months. Shares of PVR plunged about 3% to ₹1,768 whereas that of Inox Leisure declined over 4% to ₹480 apiece on the BSE in Monday's trading session.   The Adani Group has been forging ahead, cinching around 8-10 deals in the past year. Growing organically and inorganically, the group has been investing in an array of new sectors.   Reducing ‘shock and awe’ effect of omicron wave, nuclear brinkmanship, inflation scare and rising bond yield: CY22 began with the omicron scare, followed by the sudden escalation of Russia-Ukraine conflict in Mar’22, thereby pushing the world into an unprecedented phase of nuclear brinkmanship. This impacted the ‘equity risk premium’ (reflected in spike in VIX). It also resulted in a surge in commodity prices, especially crude oil, thereby triggering an inflation scare. This was followed by the more than expected hawkishness of the US Federal Reserve and India’s RBI resulting in an increase in the ‘risk free rate’ as sovereign bond yields spiked and acted as a double whammy for equity valuations. However, post the initial spurt, omicron has receded sharply while commodity prices and bond yields have started to stabilise. Also, the Russia-Ukraine conflict will likely be scaled down from global nuclear brinkmanship to a local conflict. Dip in the latest PCE inflation data for the US, general cooling down of commodity prices and the expected increase in oil output by OPEC+ will likely add credence to the peak inflation argument. Outlook and top picks: The above trends are visible in the fear index (VIX) receding and will most likely put a floor on equity valuations on a 1-year forward P/E basis, which fell from around 23x in Oct’21 to less than 18x during the May’22 sell-off. High-frequency indicators for Q1FY23 so far appear robust and indicate economic recovery is on course. Incorporating the above factors and trends, our Mar’23E target for the NIFTY50 stands at 19,000. We are overweight on stocks driven by investment rate, savings rate, credit growth, exports and pent-up discretionary consumption. Top picks: SBI, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Aditya Birla Capital, SBI Life, Larsen & Toubro, NTPC, NHPC, GAIL, Oil India, Coal India, UltraTech Cement, Bharti Airtel, Tata Communications, Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Phoenix Mills, Brigade Enterprises, Greenpanel Industries, Indian Hotels, Jubilant Foodworks, Metro Brands, Sapphire Foods, Inox Leisure, TVS Motors, Eicher Motors.  Q1FY23 is the first quarter of no covid restriction on movement since the onset of the pandemic in 2019. High-frequency indicators for the quarter so far indicate robust economic recovery, which should gather momentum going forward.   Citi Research on Monday raised its quarterly oil price forecasts for this year and its year-average outlook for 2023, because additional supply from Iran looked heavily delayed, adding to tighter market balances. Delay in Iran sanctions relief is the main factor tightening balances, Citi said. The bank now factors in Iran sanctions relief beginning in the first quarter of next year, at first adding 0.5 million barrels per day (bpd), then 1.3 million bpd over the second half. It previously expected Iran sanctions relief to add supply in mid-2022. Iran and the United States engaged in indirect talks in Vienna over the past year to revive a 2015 nuclear agreement between Tehran and world powers. Citing tighter market balances, Citi raised its second-quarter 2022 Brent price forecast by $14 to $113 per barrel, and the third and fourth quarter prices by $12, to $99 and $85, respectively. The bank estimates Brent to average $75 per barrel in 2023, revised higher by $16.   Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, raised July crude oil prices for Asian buyers to higher-than-expected levels amid concerns about tight supply and expectations of strong demand in summer. The official selling price (OSP) for July-loading Arab Light to Asia was hiked by $2.1 a barrel from June to $6.5 a barrel over Oman/Dubai quotes, just off an all-time-high recorded in May. That was much higher than most market forecasts for an increase around $1.5. Only one respondent of six in a Reuters poll had predicted a jump of $2. ""The price jump is unexpected, especially the Arab Light. We are puzzled by the decision,"" said an Asian oil trader.   Tokyo shares shrugged off early losses to close higher on Monday as tech and export shares made gains thanks to the weaker yen. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.56 percent, or 154.32 points, to 27,915.89, while the broader Topix index added 0.31 percent, or 5.97 points, to 1,939.11. The Tokyo market came under pressure in the morning as global investors interpreted solid US economic data as a further sign the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates in its fight against inflation, driving down Wall Street shares.   Shares of Rallis India Ltd dipped nearly a per cent to ₹199 apiece on the BSE in Monday's early trading session as the stock started trading ex-dividend, a day ahead of the record date for its dividend that was announced with its Q4FY22 results in April.   Multibagger stock: Rajnish Wellness Ltd has informed Indian bourses that a meeting of board of directors of the company is scheduled to be held on 13th June 2022 to consider issuance of bonus shares and stock sub-division. The company management informed about the board agenda in its latest exchange communication. Stock market observers believe that the company might be mulling stock split after its stock price surge from ₹5.56 to 187.45 apiece levels in last one year, delivering near 3250 per cent return in this period. They said that after stellar return given by this multibagger penny stock, management might have thought that subdivision of shares would enable them increase stock volume by becoming available to small investors.   India’s sovereign bond yields breached the 7.5% level for the first time in three years as the central bank’s rate-setting panel began its three-day meeting. The benchmark 10-year yield rose as much as four basis points to 7.5%, a level last seen in 2019. Yields have jumped by more than 100 basis points in 2022 amid global tightening and as the Reserve Bank of India turned hawkish with an out-of-turn rate hike last month.   Office leasing has been on an upward trajectory, aided by an accelerated shift towards grade-A properties. This was among the key highlights of the recently held analysts' day meet of Mindspace Business Parks REIT.   Surging inflation, amplified by the Russia-Ukraine war, along with faster Fed rate hikes has triggered a hawkish pivot by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In a surprise move, RBI raised the repo rate by 40 basis points to 4.4% last month in an off-cycle hike, its first increase in borrowing rates since August 2018.   Adani Transmission share price: After ushering in the new year 2022, Adani Transmission shares gave stellar return to its shareholders till beginning of May 2022. However, from first week of May 2022, this Adani group stock has been under sell-off heat. According to stock market experts, massive sell-off by FIIs, stock trading at much higher valuations and negative sentiments in the secondary markets are the major reasons for Adani Transmission share price tumble. They also said that the stock may continue to remain under consolidation till next big trigger arrived for the stock.   TVS Motor Co.

From the Sensex pack, Tech Mahindra, Asian Paints, Wipro, Hindustan Unilever Limited, Bajaj Finserv, Infosys, Tata Steel and Titan were the biggest laggards. In contrast, M&M and Axis Bank were the gainers. Elsewhere in Asia, markets in Tokyo, Shanghai and Hong Kong were trading in the green. Stock markets in the US had ended lower on Friday.   The rupee appreciated 4 paise to 77.62 against the US dollar in opening trade on Monday, supported by a weak American currency in the overseas markets. However, muted domestic equities, elevated crude oil prices and persistent foreign fund outflows restricted the rupee's rise, forex traders said. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened slightly strong at 77.65 against the American dollar and gained further momentum to quote 77.62, registering a rise of 4 paise from the last close. In the previous session, the rupee had settled at 77.66 against the US dollar.

Global oil benchmark Brent crude futures rose 0.79 per cent to USD 120.66 per barrel.

Spot gold was flat at $1,850.60 per ounce, as of 0041 GMT, while U.S. gold futures were up 0.2% at $1,853.60.    Asian markets were mixed Monday following a steep drop on Wall Street in response to a forecast-topping US jobs report that gave the Federal Reserve room to continue hiking interest rates as it struggles to contain surging inflation. US traders took flight after the closely watched non-farm payroll figures Friday, which showed a slowdown in hiring but still with more new posts created than expected. That came as more officials suggested the Federal Reserve could continue lifting borrowing costs sharply as they try to rein in inflation. However, with prices being driven higher by factors ranging from the Ukraine war to China's lockdown-induced slowdown, there are fears the bank's measures could deal a blow to the world's biggest economy.   Cryptocurrency prices today gained with Bitcoin above the $30,000 level around which it has been trading for the past month. The world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency rose more than 4% and was trading at $30,878.

Uptrend in this Va Tech Wabag share price may continue as the water treatment company has recently bagger first large-scale seawater desalination plant in Senegal and the largest in West Africa upon completion.

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das headed six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is scheduled to announce the policy resolution on Wednesday,8 June.   The price of wheat has jumped in the international markets after India announced a ban on the export of the staple cereal and due to the reduced production prospects in Ukraine following the Russian invasion, the UN food agency has said. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Price Index averaged 157.4 points in May 2022, down 0.6 per cent from April. The index, which tracks monthly changes in the international prices of a basket of commonly-traded food commodities, however, remained 22.8 per cent higher than in May 2021. The FAO Cereal Price Index averaged 173.4 points in May, up 3.7 points (2.2 per cent) from April and as much as 39.7 points (29.7 per cent) above its May 2021 value.   Monetary policy tightening measures along with rising subsidies imply that the consolidated fiscal deficit may remain elevated at 10.2% of GDP in FY23, down 20bps from FY22. The government has pegged the combined fiscal shortfall at 9.8%, of which the central deficit is seen at 6.4% and states’ at 3.4% for FY23. While these measures may help to soften the inflationary pressures by ~50bps over the coming months, that will not be enough to bring inflation within the RBI’s comfort zone of 2-6%, unless global commodity prices moderate significantly. India’s merchandise exports rose by 15.5% to $37.29 bn in May’22, on account of a healthy performance by sectors like Petroleum Products, Electronic Goods and Chemicals. However, the trade deficit widened to US$23.33bn in May’22, while imports during the month grew by 56.14% to $60.62 bn.   FII selling increased to ₹400 bn in May’22, post the ₹171 bn in Apr’22; FII selling was witnessed for the 8th consecutive month in a row. They sold more than Rs2,000bn in the last 8 months, while DIIs bought shares worth Rs508bn in May’22. Ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, higher commodity prices, elevated inflation and increased expectations of aggressive Fed rate hike in the US kept the Dollar Index at 101 levels. However, we expect sustained FII inflows to resume in 2HFY23 and continue in FY23, as India is better placed compared to many other economies.   The Japanese yen was on the back foot on Monday, ahead of a busy policy-focused week in which inflation will be in the spotlight with a major European Central Bank meeting and U.S. consumer price data scheduled. The dollar climbed to 130.99 yen in early trade, a fresh one-month high, and not far from last month's 20-year peak of 131.34, after gaining 2.95% last week. The euro has also climbed on the Japanese currency and hit 140.38 yen on Monday morning, extending a seven-year high hit last week. Barclays analysts attributed last week's softer yen to a recovery in risk assets, a rise in overseas yields, a stronger dollar and higher oil prices causing concerns about Japan's balance of trade. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major peers, was at 102.1 after gaining 0.47% last week after good jobs and manufacturing data.   The worst is still to come for the Indian rupee after its slide in May to a historic low, according to analysts and forward markets. The currency may drop to between 79 to 81 per dollar over the next few months, according to analysts from UBS AG to Nomura Holdings Inc. and Bloomberg Economics. Forwards are also pricing in a similar weakness for the rupee. The bearish forecasts -- which will see the rupee drop as much as 4% from current level -- stem from a deterioration in India’s external finances. Higher oil prices threaten to widen the current-account deficit to at least 3% of the gross domestic product, compared to a 2% sustainable level, according to UBS, even as outflows from its equity markets accelerate. “A grind higher for USD/INR from here toward 80 in the next couple of months is not a big ask,"" said Rohit Arora, emerging markets Asia strategist at UBS. “Nor do I think 80 is a runaway depreciation by any metric. It’s a very modest adjustment of a currency with deteriorating fundamentals."" The rupee declined about 1.6% in May, the biggest drop among emerging Asian currencies, spurring Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das to say that the central bank won’t allow a runaway depreciation of the currency. The current account deficit can still be comfortably funded this year, he added.   Oil prices rose more than $2 in early trade on Monday after Saudi Arabia raised prices sharply for its crude sales in July, an indicator of how tight supply is even after OPEC+ agreed to accelerate its output increases over the next two months. Brent crude futures were up $1.80, or 1.5%, at $121.52 a barrel at 2319 GMT after touching an intraday high of $121.95, extending a 1.8% gain from Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up $1.63, or 1.4%, at $120.50 a barrel after hitting a three-month high of $120.99. The contract gained 1.7% on Friday. Saudi Arabia raised the official selling price (OSP) for its flagship Arab light crude to Asia to a $6.50 premium versus the average of the Oman and Dubai benchmarks, up from a premium of $4.40 in June, state oil produce Aramco said on Sunday.   Asian shares made a muted start on Monday as caution gripped ahead of a critical reading on U.S. inflation, while the euro gained on the yen amid wagers the European Central Bank will take a major step toward policy tightening this week. Oil prices jumped in early trade after Saudi Arabia raised prices sharply for its crude sales in July, an indicator of how tight supply is even after OPEC+ agreed to accelerate its output increases over the next two months. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.1%, while Japan's Nikkei eased 0.3%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures both edged up 0.1%. Markets will be on tenterhooks for the U.S. consumer price report on Friday, especially after EU inflation shocked many with a record high last week. Forecasts are for a steep rise of 0.7% in May, though the annual pace is seen holding at 8.3% while core inflation is seen slowing a little to 5.9%. A high number would only add to expectations of aggressive tightening by the Federal Reserve with markets already priced for half-point hikes in June and July and almost 200 basis points by the end of the year.

We will continue to leverage e-commerce further through meaningful shopper insights, data analytics, speed, sharp communication and customization,"" Narayanan said. Analysts tracking the company said Nestlé India’s earnings were in line with estimates on the revenue front but disappointed on margins. Surge in milk, edible oil, coffee and wheat prices led to a sharp margin contraction of 313 bps. The company was able to save 23 bps and 70 bps (as percentage of sales) in employee and overhead spends, respectively, said analysts at ICICI Securities. Companies witnessed high inflation in the quarter. Aggressive price hikes taken by FMCG firms enabled only a partial passing on of costs from commodity inflation, they said. “Inflation has also adversely impacted demand in semi-urban and rural regions. Though we believe commodity inflation would cool down in the longer run, the next few quarters would continue to remain challenging for FMCG companies from both volume growth and margin perspective,"" analysts at ICICI Securities added. Nestle said its commodity outlook for edible oils, coffee, wheat, fuel in the short-to-medium term remains “firm to bullish"". “Input costs are expected to be on bullish trend both globally and locally. Fresh milk costs are expected to remain firm with continued increase in demand and rise in feed costs to farmers,"" the company said. Abneesh Roy at Edelweiss Securities said the company reported a “decent performance"" on the sales front with key brands doing well. However, gross margins and EBITDA margins both disappointed."

Updated: 17 Feb 2022,Nestle India’s top boss flags inflation,https://www.livemint.com/industry/retail/nestle-india-s-top-boss-flags-inflation-11645110254491.html,"NEW DELHI : Packaged foods company Nestle India is trying its best to mitigate the effects of high inflation, both for food and other commodities, and could look at pricing actions if inflation remains unrelenting, said Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director, Nestle India. “It is important to note that food inflation and commodity inflation is here to stay for a while at least,"" he said during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. The maker of Maggi noodles and Nescafe reported a 20% decline in December quarter net profit to ₹387 crore, while its operating revenue increased 8.93% to ₹3,739.32 crore. It also reported 8% year-on-year growth in domestic sales volumes, which was broad-based and largely driven by sales volume and price hikes. The company follows a January-December financial year. Nestle India hiked prices selectively up to 2% in the fourth quarter. Narayanan said prices of at least six commodities, including edible oils, arabica coffee and non-food items, such as plastic and paper, were at a decadal-high. “As far as food inflation is concerned, it is here for now. This is not a futuristic statement we are talking about. Between the December quarter and now we are seeing distinct storm clouds and, in fact, the storm is upon us…so this is what we are facing today. This is what my team and I are trying to mitigate as best as we can,"" he said. The company has been running efficiency programmes and cost-saving initiatives under project Shark, besides focussing on strategic acquisitions, to tide over the commodity headwinds. “The company has got three or four levers that it uses (to mitigate high commodity prices). One is its portfolio. Another is economies and cost efficiencies. A third is leveraging the impact of scale and the fourth is pricing. How much we will have to touch upon each one of these only time will tell,"" he said. Pricing could also be a lever if inflation remains at elevated levels in the future, Narayanan said. The company surprised investors with 9% value growth in rural markets, even as many fast-moving consumer goods peers saw a dip in rural volumes amid the stress on rural income. “We get 20-25% of sales coming from rural markets and villages actually have grown for us. We have closed Q4 at about 9% growth,"" he said. Judicious portfolio management and pushing the right stock keeping units in the rural markets helped it sustain growth, the company said. Considering that the rural markets are stressed, with job losses and pressure on household incomes, the company will “pragmatically"" but strongly enhance its semi-urban and rural distribution, he said.

Nestle India, the Indian subsidiary of the Swiss multinational FMCG giant Nestle, had to face on social media the wrath of consumers, who accused the company of hurting religious sentiments by using the sacred images on Kitkat wrappers. The company expressed regret and said that as a pre-emptive action, it withdrew those packs from the market last year. ""We do understand the sensitivity of the matter and regret if we have inadvertently hurt anyone's sentiment. We had already withdrawn these packs from the market last year. We thank you for your understanding and support,"" said a Nestle spokesperson. According to the company, these were travel packs meant to celebrate beautiful local destinations. Nestle, which owns brands such as Maggi, Nescafe, Milkmaid, Munch and Milkibar, said it wanted to celebrate the culture of Odisha with designs on packs representing 'Pattachitra'. ""Last year, we wanted to celebrate the culture of Odisha with designs on packs representing 'Pattachitra', an art form uniquely identifiable by its vivid imagery. We wanted to encourage people to know about the art and its artisans. Our past campaigns have also shown that consumers like to collect and keep such beautiful designs,"" it said. Pattachitra is an ancient Odisha-based artworks of cloth-based scroll painting. This artform is known for its intricate details as well as mythological narratives and folktales inscribed in it. It was originally created for ritual use and as souvenirs for pilgrims to Puri, as well as other temples in Odisha. Nestle India has nine production facilities with a turnover of ₹13,350 crore in 2021. Last year in April, Nestle India had also apologised for wrongly depicting Manipur's Keibul Lamjao National Park to be located in Meghalaya on the packaging of its KitKat chocolate after objection by authorities from the state government. The packaging of the particular batch of the KitKat travel break chocolate had also displayed a picture of a Red Panda, a species which is not found at the Keibul Lamjao National Park.

Updated: 17 Jan 2022,All eyes on rural demand in  FMCG  firms’  Q3  results,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/all-eyes-on-rural-demand-infmcgfirmsq3results-11642355459787.html,"Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) will announce its December quarter (Q3FY22) results on Thursday and investors are expected to closely track management commentary on rural demand. Recall that while announcing Q2 results, HUL had said recent industry trends hint at rural demand moderation, which need to be monitored. Q3 volume growth expectations are sequentially lower, but product price increases would likely support revenue growth. “Expect 9% revenue growth (for HUL), which would be pricing-led with volume growth lagging at 2%,"" said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd. As other fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies declare their Q3 results, investors can expect a similar theme of subdued volume growth and higher pricing to play out. Aggregate sector revenue growth is expected to be lower sequentially. “HPC & Foods’ (FMCG firms) volume growth rates have visibly slowed (JM Financial estimates 1-2% versus 5% in Sep-Q), with some offset from higher pricing to pass-on some commodity costs pressure,"" said analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd. “While this leads to revenue growth deceleration in staples, two-year CAGR may not be too different versus (Q2) due to higher price component,"" the brokerage said. CAGR is compound annual growth rate. Marico Ltd is expected to be one of the best performers on revenue growth. In its pre-quarter update, it said Q3 consolidated revenue growth was in the low teens. Marico’s December quarter domestic volumes are expected to be flat year-on-year (y-o-y) versus an 8% growth in Q2. On two-year revenue CAGR, both Marico and Dabur India Ltd are expected to perform relatively better than peers. Nestle India Ltd could sustain double-digit growth, even as raw material inflation dents margins, according to Jefferies’ analysts. The brokerage expects 8% y-o-y revenue growth for Britannia Industries Ltd, which would largely be pricing-led even as volumes remain flat. On the profitability front, continued commodity inflation could compress y-o-y gross margins, though sequential performance is likely to improve. Savings in advertising and promotion spends may help net profit. Overall, management commentary on demand conditions, especially rural market; margin prospects and price hikes are key factors to track. Meanwhile, FMCG stock valuations have corrected from their highs in keeping with demand worries. Bloomberg data shows that shares of HUL, Dabur India, Britannia, and Marico trade at 52.8 times, 47 times, 45.4 times, and 42 times each of their FY23 estimated earnings, respectively. In the near-term, the Omicron coronavirus variant poses a threat and some regions have imposed curbs to contain its spread. In general, analysts expect the FMCG sector to see consistent recovery over 2022, supported by minimal potential impediments due to covid-19. “While we are witnessing a covid surge, consumer behaviour shifts are no longer as dramatic as in the first two waves. The only impact we see are for (1) HUL’s personal care business, which could again see a slowdown as consumer mobility falls, and (2) Dabur’s healthcare business, which could see strong growth in consumption in this phase,"" said analysts from Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a report last week. How rural demand shapes up remains key. Gross margin pressures would continue for a while until input prices soften meaningfully, analysts said. These factors may keep investors cautious on FMCG stocks in the near future. “While staple companies face weak earnings outlook in the near term, FY23 could be a year of turnaround,"" said Jefferies’ analysts."

Leading financiers have reported 3-8% QoQ loan growth and YoY growth, too, has gained traction. With lower slippages and improving collections/recoveries, we expect improvement in the overall stress pool and credit cost for banks. Behaviour of ECLGS lending pool and restructured portfolio would be key to watch out. For NBFCs/HFCs, the RBI’s notification relating to harmonisation of IRACP norms would likely result in an uptick in GNPAs. However, excess provisioning under ECL framework over IRACP norms is likely to limit rise in credit cost. HFCs are now required to implement minimum 50% LCR, the drag may weigh on their NIMs. For Q3FY22, we estimate 9% YoY growth in NII for banks, 2-4% operating profit growth while subsiding credit cost is expected to support >35% earnings growth. Preferences and recommendations: Growth momentum is gaining traction for HDFC Bank, Kotak, Federal and stress is being managed well by SBI, Axis Bank, thereby, improving visibility on earnings trajectory. We stay with them as our preferred picks. Amongst non-banks, we prefer Aditya Birla Capital, HDFC, Chola and CreditAccess Grameen.
