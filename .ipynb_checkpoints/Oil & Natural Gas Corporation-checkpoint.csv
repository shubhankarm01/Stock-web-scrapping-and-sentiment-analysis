Updated: 03 Jul 2022,Windfall tax to regain the ₹1 lakh crore revenue lost in excise cuts: Report,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/windfall-tax-by-govt-to-regain-most-of-rs-1-lakh-crore-revenue-lost-in-excise-cuts-sources-11656826873556.html,"The windfall tax on oil produced within India and fuel exported overseas will make up for more than three-fourths of the revenue that the government lost when it cut excise duty on petrol and diesel to cool soaring inflation, according to news agency PTI report citing industry sources said. This development comes following India joining on July 1 a select group of countries that began taxing windfall gains accruing to oil companies from soaring energy prices. What is windfall tax? A windfall tax is a type of one-off tax on companies that have seen their profits increase extraordinarily based on favorable market conditions. The government has imposed a ₹6 per litre tax on the export of petrol and jet fuel (ATF) and ₹13 a litre on the export of diesel effective July 1. A ₹23,250 per tonne tax was levied on crude oil produced domestically. Meanwhile, two sources with knowledge of the calculations said, the tax on crude oil producers like Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Oil India Ltd and Vedanta Ltd alone will fetch the government ₹69,000 crore annually considering 29.7 million tonnes of oil production in 2021-22 fiscal (April 2021 to March 2022), . Notably, for the remaining nine months of the current fiscal, the levy would get the government almost ₹52,000 crore if the tax remains in place till March 31, 2023.On top of this, the new tax brought in on the export of petrol, diesel and ATF would bring in additional revenue. According to one of the sources, ""India exported 2.5 million tonnes of petrol, 5.7 million tonnes of diesel and 797,000 tonnes of ATF during April and May. Even if these volumes fall to a third due to the new levy and other restrictions imposed, the government would still be richer by at least ₹20,000 crore if the tax continues till March 2023."" Reliance Industries Ltd operates a 35.2 million tonnes a year only-for-exports oil refinery at Jamnagar in Gujarat and that refinery is expected to continue overseas shipments even with the new tax, the second source said. Some exports are also expected from the firm's adjoining 33 million tonnes a year refinery that is meant to cater to the domestic market. ""Reliance has a fuel retailing joint venture with BP and that joint venture operates 1,459 out of 83,423 petrol pumps in the country. Even after meeting the full requirement of the 1,459 petrol pumps and selling some fuel to PSU retailers, it still would be left with exportable surplus"" the source said. Similarly, Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy operates a 20 million tonnes a year refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat. It has 6,619 petrol pumps whose full requirement would be less than about 12 million tonnes of petrol, diesel and ATF that the refinery produces annually. The two taxes together will accrue as much as ₹72,000 crore or over 85 per cent of the revenue that the government lost from cutting excise duty on petrol and diesel, sources said.

Updated: 01 Jul 2022,"RIL, ONGC shares crash after govt hikes export tax on petrol, diesel",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/govt-hikes-export-tax-on-petrol-diesel-and-atfs-ril-shares-see-sharp-fall-11656651138911.html,"The government on Friday announced an increase in taxes on the export of petrol, diesel, and aviation turbine fuel (ATF). The centre has also mandated exporters to meet the requirements of the domestic market first. The government has levied a ₹6 per litre tax on exports of petrol and ATF and ₹13 per litre on exports of diesel. The government has also announced taxes on windfall gains made by crude oil producers. The government also slapped a ₹23,230 per tonne additional tax on domestically produced crude oil to take away windfall gains accruing to producers from high international oil prices, a separate government notification showed. Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) witnessed a sharp fall after the export tax hike announcement. RIL shares plunged more than 5%, its biggest decline in about 18 months, whereas ONGC shares tanked 10% in Friday's early deals, while BSE Sensex was down nearly a per cent. “Reliance is witnessing a sharp fall after the Government has levied taxes on windfall gains made by domestic refineries. Earlier Reliance was firing on all cylinders but now there is a break in its refinery business as the commodity cycle is also reversing however other verticals have strong growth potential,"" said Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart Ltd. Fuels from Mukesh Ambani-led RIL's Jamnagar refinery are exported to several countries across the world.  Gasoline exporters have been asked to give a self declaration that 50% of the quantity mentioned in the shipping bill has been or will be supplied to the domestic market during the current financial year. The tax on exports follows oil refiners, particularly the private sector, reaping huge gains from exporting fuel to markets such as Europe and the US. The tax on domestically produced crude oil follows local producers reaping windfall gains from the surge in international oil prices.  Domestic petrol and diesel prices have been steady since May when the government announced a cut in excise duty on petrol by 8 per litre, and 6 rupees per litre on diesel on May 21, 2022. The domestic fuel prices are likely to remain low as the taxes announced today by the government do not impact them."

The following proposal has been raised after the government failed to find any suitable candidate for top job. According to the proposal,  any candidate to be eligible for consideration should not be more than 60 years of age on the date of occurrence of vacancy, said ministry's office memorandum sent to the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on 17 June. The recent vacancy arose after Shashi Shanker superannuated on 31 March, 2021. Currently, the minimum age prescribed for being eligible for the top job is 45 years. Apart from this, internal candidates need to have two years of residual service as on the date of vacancy and three years for external candidates.

This means, current acting chairman, Alka Mittal -- scheduled to retire in August-end would come under the zone of consideration. Also, the ministry has also proposed appointment for a period of three years from the date of joining instead of the present five-year term. The selection for the top post will be done through a three-member search-cum-selection committee headed by PESB chairman and composed of oil secretary and former Indian Oil chairman B Ashok. Earlier on 4 February, the panel was formed, but the terms of reference are being framed only now. ""Keeping in view the strategic importance and vision for the company and its future, the board did not recommend any candidate and decided to constitute a search committee,"" the ministry letter said referring to PESB's interviews on 5 June, 2021. The panel was constituted after eight months of that recommendation on 4 February. The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) approved ""consideration of central government officers, including those of the armed forces of the Union and the all India services for the post on immediate absorption basis.""

If the proposal is accepted, it will throw open the field for ONGC's former director (finance) Subhash Kumar as well as current acting chairman Alka Mittal. Both of them are otherwise were ineligible for the post. As per government practice, PESB recommends a name for a board-level position at least three months prior to arising of the vacancy. While in ONGC's case, PESB advertised and interviewed candidates after the retirement of Shashi Shanker on 31 March, 2021. With Shashi Shanker's retirement, director for finance and senior most director on ONGC board -- Subhash Kumar -- was given the additional charge of chairman and managing director. When he retired on 3 December, 2021, ONGC's Director for Human Resources -- Alka Mittal -- was given additional charge. She will superannuate in August.

Updated: 28 May 2022,ONGC results: 31% jump in Q4 profit,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/ongc-results-31-jump-in-q4-profit-on-high-oil-gas-prices-11653754926561.html,"ONGC results: On May 28, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) reported a 31.5 percent increase in net profit for the March quarter, owing to the best-ever price for crude oil it produces and sells. According to the company's regulatory filing, standalone net profit was ₹8,859.54 crore, or ₹7.04 per share, in January-March, compared to ₹6,733.97 crore, or ₹5.35 per share, in the same period a year ago. From ₹21,188.91 crore in January-March 2021 to ₹34,497.24 crore in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2021-22, revenue from operations increased to ₹34,497.24 crore. ONGC reported a record net profit of ₹40,305.74 crore for the full fiscal year (April 2021 to March 2022), up from ₹11,246.44 crore the previous year. This comes after international energy costs began to rise in late 2021 and peaked in February after Russia invaded Ukraine. ONGC receives international pricing for the crude oil it produces, hence the rise in energy prices benefited it. ONGC gets international rates as the downstream fuel retailers too price petrol, diesel and other petroleum products at global rates. Consolidated net profit, after including those earned by its subsidiaries like HPCL and ONGC Videsh Ltd, soared to ₹12,061.44 crore in March quarter and ₹49,294.06 crore in the full fiscal 2021-22.

Updated: 19 Dec 2021,ONGC subsidiary OPaL reports first-ever profit of ₹18 cr during April-Sept,https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/ongc-subsidiary-opal-reports-first-ever-profit-of-rs-18-cr-during-aprilsept-11639912387122.html,"NEW DELHI : India's top oil and gas producer ONGC has scripted a sharp turnaround in fortunes of its subsidiaries with its petrochemical unit reporting its first ever profit, a top official said.  ONGC Petro additions Ltd (OPaL), the venture ONGC floated for downward integration and expansion into petrochemical field by utilizing its naphtha stream from Hazira and Uran and C2+ components from imported LNG, has been steadily seeing operational profit or EBITDA improvement since 2016-17 but the lopsided capital structure with high-debt servicing cost and high depreciation during the initial period of capitalisation led to incurring net losses.  ""During the first half of the current fiscal (April to September), OPaL made a profit after tax of ₹18 crore,"" ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Subhash Kumar said.  Kumar, who pivoted the turnaround story with his finance background, said OPaL is in the process of exiting from the SEZ which would improve the profitability by ₹800 crore per annum and about ₹600 crore of more profits will be added if the government were to approve a proposal for the company becoming a unit of ONGC or is merged with it.  Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) during 2002 to 2006 conceptualized several joint ventures to diversify in other than exploration and production (E&P) business with an objective of value addition, downstream integration and monetisation of its own stranded gas assets.  These projects - OPaL, ONGC Mangalore Petrochemicals Ltd (OMPL) and ONGC Tripura Power Company (OTPC) were successfully implemented and are now operating at full capacity.  ONGC as promoter played lead role in selection of LSTK/PMC contractors, execution of various feedstock and off-take agreements, resolution of various complex techno- commercial, regulatory and taxation issues crept during execution and commissioning of these projects.  Besides resolving operational, financial and regulatory issues, it let the joint ventures be headed by professional domain expert best from the industry.  Kumar said as per ONGC 2040 Strategy, going forward 70 per cent revenue is expected from refinery and petrochemical business and 10 per cent profit will be contributed from non-oil and gas sector, and so the role of these non-E&P JVs will continue to play a crucial role in the Group.  ONGC holds 49.36 per cent stake in the 1.1 million tons per annum capacity OPaL, GAIL has 49.21 per cent and GSPC the remaining 1.43 per cent.  ""ONGC has played a crucial role in OPaL's turnaround story starting from support during construction phase, its stabilization and continuous supply of feed stock from its plant which is crucial to the profitability of any petrochemical venture.  In addition to an equity contribution of ₹998 crore, ONGC has also subscribed to share warrants issued by OPaL amounting to ₹3,451 crore,"" he said.  The firm also single handedly backstopped ₹7,778 crore CCDs and provided comfort letters amounting to ₹9,500 crore for the loans, he said.  OTPC, in which ONGC holds 50% stake, set up a 726.6 MW gas-based power plant in Tripura. The plant started operation in March 2014. Kumar said OTPC is a classic case of an efficiently managed entity.  During the project phase in order to avoid delays, entire oversized cargo (ODC) was routed through Bangladesh.  Plant has been generating profit since inception and is one of a few gas based companies paying dividends. OTPC caters to about 30% of electricity requirement of the entire North Eastern region at a competitive tariff.  It is the anchor customer for offtake of ONGC's gas from Tripura, off-taking about 60% of total gas production and thus utilizing the stranded gas in the region unlocking the value of ₹700 crore per annum.  With these investments, the state of Tripura has become power surplus from power deficient state, enabling exporting electricity to Bangladesh.  Till date with an equity investment of ₹560 crore, ONGC has received about ₹310 crore as dividend and ₹106 crore premium on sale of residual equity to GIP in 2015. Petronet MHB Ltd is another classic turn around story where ONGC as a promoter played a crucial role in turning a loss making entity to a profit making dividend paying entity.  With continuous guidance at Board level and effective management the company is consistently making profits even during the Pandemic period. ONGC has earned a total dividend of ₹208 crore out of total investment of ₹274 crore.  In case of OMPL, the standalone petchem unit was subject to low spreads due to cyclic nature due to supply/demand dynamics in the region.  To tide over this, ONGC has initiated a merger of the company with its refinery subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL).  ""ONGCs presence across the value chain and beyond the E&P business is also an effective way to mitigate risk. ONGC Group is able to better shield itself from volatile crude markets as the combined entity will have exposure across commodity cycles,"" he said.  The company had acquired the government's 51.11% equity stake in HPCL to expand its presence into midstream and downstream sectors. ""Going forward, ONGC's major stake in HPCL and MRPL will become the dominant driving factor for maximizing the shareholding value,"" he added.

Additionally, R&D works are in progress for development of High Temperature Steam Electrolysers, Static Hydrogen Compression System, and development of sea water electrolyser,"" Singh added. With the current cost of green hydrogen produced by electrolysis estimated at around ₹350 per kg, India’s green hydrogen playbook plans to bring it down to ₹160 per kg by 2029-30. Such a cost price will make India's plan to build green hydrogen plants to run on electricity produced by green energy sources a value proposition. Apart from providing grid-scale storage solutions and feedstock for ammonia production, hydrogen can be used for fuel cell and is being leveraged for mobility applications and transportation. It also has usage in sectors such as chemicals, iron, steel, fertilizer, refining, and heating. “We are exploring various options using Hydrogen like transport, blending with natural gas, green ammonia, methanol etc. and aspire to lead “Hydrogen Economy"" in India and globally,"" Singh said. NTPC has also secured a raft of project contracts under the aegis of International Solar Alliance (ISA) in Cuba, Niger and Malawi to help set up solar parks to meet these countries’ electricity demands. NTPC is also eyeing similar opportunities in other ISA member countries in Africa such as Sudan, Congo, Mozambique, Egypt, Uganda, Rwanda, Gambia, Tanzania, Senegal, and Zimbabwe. NTPC has been engaged as a facilitator by ISA and is targeting to help set up 10 GW capacity in ISA member countries. “We are actively pursuing various option for increasing geo-strategic reach.
