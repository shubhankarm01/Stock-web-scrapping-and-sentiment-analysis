BENGALURU, July 6 (Reuters) - Reliance, India's largest retailer, said on Wednesday it has partnered with Gap Inc to sell the U.S. clothing retailer's brands locally, marking its latest expansion in the booming consumer market.
Under a long-term franchise agreement, Reliance will sell Gap merchandise through a mix of exclusive brand stores, multi-brand outlets and e-commerce platforms, the company said in a statement.
""The partnership is aimed at leveraging Gap’s position as a leading casual lifestyle brand,"" said Reliance Retail, which is part of billionaire Mukesh Ambani's conglomerate Reliance Industries.
Financials terms of the deal were not disclosed.
It comes just days after Reliance announced a plan to open outlets of popular British sandwich and coffee chain Pret A Manger in India. It already has partnerships with several luxury brands including Burberry.
For Gap, whose brands include Old Navy and Banana Republic, the partnership comes as clothing retailers struggle with weak demand in the face of surging inflation.
Gap was looking forward to expanding ""across key international markets"", its executive Adrienne Gernand said in the statement, adding the deal was part of its efforts to diversify its business portfolio through a partner-based model.

“While profits generated from oil exports will fall because of windfall taxes, they will likely remain higher than the levels over April 2020 to March 2022 if refining margins are sustained at the highs seen in April to June this year,” wrote Moody’s analyst Hui Ting Sim in a note. “High crude oil prices will support the earnings of oil producers.”
India’s move to impose levies on energy firms from the start of July to tap windfall gains from high oil prices caused the stock prices of both Reliance and ONGC to fall on Friday and for spreads on their dollar bonds to widen. Spreads on some of those notes have stabilized or tightened since as investors assess the impact of the government charges.
Moody’s expects the government measures to be temporary and the taxes to be eventually adjusted, according to rating company’s note. The taxes are aimed at helping India shore up revenues as it faces challenges in managing its fiscal deficit, after the government joined a growing cohort of countries to introduce such levies.

New Delhi imposed levies Friday that targeted overseas sales of gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel, according to a government notification, along with taxes on crude produced from domestic fields. They are effective July 1.
India is joining a growing number nations that are placing windfall levies on energy firms to cope with surging costs. The taxes are aimed at helping India shore up revenues as it faces challenges in managing its fiscal deficit, while sustaining growth and controlling inflation amid elevated commodity prices.
“The refiners export these products at globally prevailing prices, which are very high,” the finance ministry said in a statement. “As exports are becoming highly remunerative, it has been seen that certain refiners are drying out their pumps in the domestic market.”
Increased exports by some refiners was one of the reasons why state-run fuel retailers such as Indian Oil Corp. and Bharat Petroleum Corp. had been forced to step up imports of gasoline and diesel to cover shortfalls at gas stations.
The new taxes weren’t entirely unexpected as the government had cut fuel sales levies, causing it to miss out on a lot of revenue, said Deven Choksey, managing director at KRChoksey Investment Managers Pvt. Reliance has been in an exceptionally profitable situation, he said. “What you’re going to lose is the super profit. Normal profit you will continue to make.”
Reliance Industries slumped the most since December, erasing most of its gains this year. The heavyweight’s stock fell as much as 8.7%, dragging the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex lower. Shares of Reliance had risen almost 10% this year through Thursday, outperforming a 9% decline in the benchmark index.

MUMBAI, June 30 (Reuters) - Reliance Industries said on Thursday it would open outlets of Pret A Manger in India under a franchise deal with the British sandwich and coffee chain, a first foray by the Indian firm in the country's growing food and beverage industry.
Reliance Brands Ltd (RBL), a unit of the conglomerate that also runs India's biggest retail chain, would start by opening branches of Pret, as the brand is known in Britain, in big Indian cities, both companies said.
RBL Chief Executive Darshan Mehta said in joint statement the partnership was ""rooted in the strong growth potential"" of the Pret brand, known for its organic coffee and upmarket sandwiches, and the Indian food and beverage industry.
The first outlet would open in Mumbai before March 2023 and India was expected to become one of Pret's top three markets in three years, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Pret A Manger, whose name means ""ready to eat"" in French, first opened in London in 1986. It now has 550 outlets globally, including in the United States and several European states. It is owned by investment group JAB and founder Sinclair Beecham.
In India, the brand will compete with Starbucks, which has a joint venture with India's Tata, and Costa Coffee, which is owned by Coca-Cola.
Mukesh Ambani, one India's richest men, runs Reliance, which has more than 2,000 supermarkets and grocery stores in India. Reliance also has partnerships with luxury brands, such as Burberry and Jimmy Choo.

June 29 (Reuters) - Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani has stepped down from the telecoms arm of Reliance Industries , handing the reins to his son Akash and setting the stage for a leadership transition at his energy-to-retail conglomerate.
Mukesh's 30-year-old son Akash has been appointed chairman of the board of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, the company said in a regulatory filing https://refini.tv/3Nrs773 on Tuesday. Akash was already a non-executive director at the telecoms arm.
Mukesh Ambani, who ranked tenth on the Forbes global billionaire's list, signaled last year his children would have significant roles in the family's business, which has grown six fold in the past decade into a $218 billion empire.
Reliance is ""in the process of effecting a momentous leadership transition"", he said at an event in December.
Analysts say the 65-year-old has positioned experienced executives and long-time friends and family to steer his children through the transition, and they have taken larger roles at annual general meetings and led some company announcements.
Shares in Reliance Industries rose 2.7% on Wednesday.
Akash Ambani, who attended Brown University, was part of a team that brokered a $5.7 billion investment in 2020 by Meta Platforms in Jio Platforms, a Reliance unit.
Akash's twin sister Isha is a director on the boards of Jio as well as Reliance Retail, which houses the conglomerate's ambitious bets in India's brick-and-mortar space. Media reports have tipped her as the next chairperson of the retail business.
The youngest of the siblings, Anant, is a director at Reliance's renewable energy, and oil and chemical units.

Tuesday's move is Mukesh Ambani's biggest step back from the business yet. Still, he will continue as the chairman of Jio Platforms, a Reliance unit that owns Jio Infocomm and other digital assets.

The report, which cited two people familiar with the discussions, said that Reliance is in talks with Barclays Bank Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank to buy the Boots drugstore chain.
A consortium of Apollo Global Management Inc. and Reliance made a binding offer for Boots earlier this month that valued Boots at more than $6.1 billion, Bloomberg News previously reported.
Reliance declined to comment to Mint, which said it didn’t receive responses to queries emailed to the lenders.
The Walgreens Boots Alliance board is likely to meet in the next few days to discuss the potential deal with the consortium, and following that, the Reliance board will meet to approve the proposed takeover, one of the two people told Mint.
Walgreens had been seeking a valuation of about £7 billion ($8.6 billion) for Boots, Bloomberg News reported earlier. The business runs a network of more than 2,200 stores across the UK, as well as private-label brands like No7 Beauty Co. and operations in a smattering of other countries.

Total Economic Impact (TEI) study reveals that customers also achieved a 90% reduction rate in likelihood of major security breach
BOSTON, June 23, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rapid7, Inc. (NASDAQ: RPD), a leading provider of security analytics and automation, today announced findings from a new commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Rapid7 quantifying the Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) and benefits of the company’s managed detection and response (MDR) services. Through comprehensive customer interviews and financial analysis, Forrester found that Rapid7’s MDR service provided a 549 percent return on investment over three years for a composite organization.
As the threat landscape becomes increasingly fragmented and complex, security operations teams require the right tools, resources, and processes to effectively secure their environments. According to the study, “Rapid7 MDR services extend a security team’s ability to detect, triage, investigate, and actively respond to threats through 24/7/365 monitoring and security operations designed to stop cyber threats.”
""Threats are growing, but security teams are not, and the problems these teams need to solve cannot be addressed by technology alone,"" said Jeremiah Dewey, vice president of managed services at Rapid7. ""Customers need true partnership, and that is at the center of our MDR mission. We believe this study further validates the value of partnering with Rapid7 and shows the immense benefit of investing in a world-class service to supplement the technology"".
“With Rapid7 MDR, there is peace of mind in knowing that we have completion of response and [knowing] there is an expert helping us with incident response,” said a director of information security at a financial service firm interviewed for the study. “I’d say we’re 100% more prepared to handle a security incident with Rapid7 MDR.”

In April 2020, Meta's Facebook invested $5.7 billion in Reliance's Jio Platforms, aiming to allow WhatsApp to offer payments services to millions of small businesses. The deal helped billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance slash its heavy debt load.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said Reliance did not disclose the deal even after newspaper reports in March 2020 published price-sensitive details about the imminent investment that led to a spike in its shares.
Reliance did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside regular business hours.
""When the bits of (unpublished price-sensitive information) that then became selectively available the company abdicated its responsibility to verify and come clean on the unverified information that was floating around,"" SEBI said in its order late on Monday.
SEBI said it was ""incumbent"" on Reliance to provide ""due clarification on its own"" once it knew about the ""selective availability"" of the information.
The regulator imposed a penalty of 3 million Indian rupees ($38,522) on Reliance and the two compliance officers. ($1 = 77.8780 Indian rupees)

MUMBAI (Reuters) -U.S. media behemoth Walt Disney and Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries were the major winners in a high-stakes bid to broadcast the IPL, the world's richest cricket league, for the next five years in deals fetching the organisers $6.2 billion.
Disney-owned Star India retained the television broadcast rights to the Indian Premier League for 235.75 billion Indian rupees ($3.02 billion), Jay Shah, a top cricket board official said on Tuesday, after a three-day online auction saw the league's broadcast value triple from the last one in 2017.
At $3.02 billion, Disney will pay over a billion dollars more than its previous bid in 2017, which also included online streaming rights.
Viacom18, a broadcasting joint venture run by Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries, won digital streaming rights from 2023 to 2027, for 237.58 billion Indian rupees.
The BCCI received a total of 483.9 billion Indian rupees from the media rights for the five-year period, BCCI secretary Shah said in a series of tweets.
""IPL is now the 2nd most valued sporting league in the world in terms of per match value,"" he tweeted.
Disney's Hotstar Plus platform, which has so far streamed the IPL, is the market leader in India's crowded online streaming market, with more than 50 million paid subscribers, which analysts attribute mostly to its strong cricket content.
There were four sets of bids that took place in the online auction, two of which went to Viacom18 and Disney.
The BCCI did not specify which companies won the other two bids, which included a bespoke package that includes high-value matches as well as rights to broadcast in foreign territories.
Launched in 2008, the IPL, counting top Indian industrialists and Bollywood stars such as Shah Rukh Khan among its franchise owners, is often seen as a surefire ticket to high TV ratings and growth in India's booming online streaming space.

The Telegraph,27 days ago,Asia’s richest man makes £5bn bid for Boots,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/india-richest-man-makes-5bn-103654750.html,Asia's richest man has joined forces with US private equity giant Apollo to launch a £5bn bid for Boots.,"mukesh ambani - Rajat Gupta/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock
Asia's richest man has joined forces with US private equity giant Apollo to launch a £5bn bid for Boots.
Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries is part of a consortium that has lodged a binding offer for the chemist chain.
The move puts the investors among the favourites to sweep up the international arm of Walgreens, the US retail giant which took control of Boots in a deal worth £9bn in 2014.
As part of the offer, Walgreens would have the option to hang onto a minority stake in Boots. It comes after a rival consortium of the Issa brothers, who own Asda, and TDR capital were reported to be going cold on a deal.
Walgreens hired bankers from Goldman Sachs to find a buyer at the end of last year. It has put a £7bn price tag on the UK chain after selling its wholesale arm - Alliance Healthcare - in 2021 for $6.5bn (£4.8bn).
Chris Beckett, head of equity research at Quilter Cheviot, said: “The price offered is also possibly lower than initially hoped for by Walgreens, and could be as a consequence of recent market volatility.
""Clearly Walgreens wants to move now and get on with its growth plans, rather than hold out for a better price.""
Boots, which is almost 180 years old and boasts 2,000 stores that employ around 50,000 staff, has attracted keen interest from buyout funds. CVC and Bain were among the early contenders for the business, but have since pulled out of the process.
Recent efforts to revamp the store estate had fuelled speculation that the business was being primed for sale. Walgreens had faced criticism in the past for failing to invest enough money to modernise the retailer, which is facing challenges to its market share.
Boots has proven relatively resilient to the digital upheaval that has triggered a wave of retail collapses on the high street, however, because of its dominance in prescription and beauty products.
The chemist chain, which is run in the UK by the former Currys boss Seb James, reported retail sales had climbed by 22pc at the end of March. James said the retailer had a “rejuvenated store portfolio and increasingly powerful online presence”.

The buyout firm and Indian conglomerate submitted a bid for the Boots drugstore chain this week that’s fully backed by committed financing, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Their proposal values Boots at more than £5 billion ($6.3 billion), the people said.
Reliance, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, may be looking to tap its expertise in emerging markets to wring further growth out of the British high street staple. Ambani, who is one of India’s richest men, is in the midst of pivoting his traditionally refining-focused conglomerate toward businesses that will better help him tap the country’s billion-plus consumers.
Walgreens’ negotiations with Apollo and Reliance currently have the most momentum, the people said. Their main competitor in the bidding, a consortium of Britain’s billionaire Issa brothers and TDR Capital, submitted a non-binding offer in recent weeks, Bloomberg News has reported. They remain interested in Boots, though their proposal is lower than what Apollo and Reliance offered, the people said.
Apollo and Reliance have offered to let Walgreens keep a stake in the business after any deal, according to the people. A winning bidder could be picked as soon as the coming weeks, the people said.
Deliberations are ongoing, and there’s no certainty they will lead to a transaction. Representatives for the bidding groups and Walgreens declined to comment.

One of India’s richest men has joined forces with a US private equity firm to launch a £5 billion takeover attempt for pharmacy chain Boots.
In April, billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s firm Reliance Industries started working with Apollo Global Management on a potential move for the historic UK retailer.
It is now understood that the two partnering companies have placed a takeover approach for Boots.
The possible buyout is part of plans by Reliance to expand rapidly outside of Asia, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the bid.
The process comes after Boots’ current owner, Walgreen Boots Alliance, announced a review of the UK business which could lead to a sale.
Initial reports had suggested that WBA could seek to gain as much as £6 billion for Boots, which owns more than 2,200 stores across the UK.
It is reported that the US retail giant is likely to keep a minority stake in boots as part of a deal.
Apollo is attempting to buy a major UK retailer within two years of failed efforts to buy supermarket chains Morrisons and Asda during their separate sales processes.
Boots has revealed a jump in sales for the three months to February in its latest financial results, amid a recovery in high street footfall.
Total UK sales grew by 15.2% over the quarter to February 28, compared with the same period last year.
Boots declined to comment. Reliance and Apollo have also been contacted for comment."

The week, the EU Sets Harshest Russian Sanctions, Targeting Oil and Insurance, with exemptions to Hungary.
The European Union is set to impose its toughest sanctions yet on Russia, banning imports of its oil and blocking insurers from covering its cargoes of crude, officials and diplomats say, as the West seeks to deprive Moscow of cash it needs to fund the war on Ukraine and keep its economy functioning.
The sanctions, which are expected to be completed in the coming days, are harsher than expected. The ban on insurers will cover tankers carrying Russian oil anywhere in the world. These sanctions could undercut Russia’s efforts to sell its oil in Asia. European companies insure most of the world’s oil trade.
Russian Stays One Step Ahead of Sanctions
But why will these sanctions work any better than any other set of sanctions. Shippers and refiners have been very skilled at hiding origin of Russian oil.
The Wall Street Journal explains Russian Oil Producers Stay One Step Ahead of Sanctions
In the wake of the invasion of Ukraine and sanctions from the U.S. and the European Union, traders are working to obscure the origins of Russian oil to keep it flowing. The oil is being concealed in blended refined products such as gasoline, diesel and chemicals.
Oil is also being transferred between ships at sea, a page out of the playbook used to buy and sell sanctioned Iranian and Venezuelan oil. The transfers are happening in the Mediterranean, off the coast of West Africa and the Black Sea, with oil then heading toward China, India and Western Europe, according to shipping companies.
Overall, Russian oil exports rebounded in April, after dropping in March as the first Western sanctions took effect, the International Energy Agency said. Russia’s oil exports rose by 620,000 barrels to 8.1 million barrels a day, close to its prewar levels, with the biggest increase going to India.

One of India’s richest businessmen is plotting a joint takeover bid for the high street chain Boots.
Mukesh Ambani, the biggest shareholder and chairman of Reliance Industries, is reportedly working on a potential offer with US buyout firm Apollo Global Management.
If successful, Mumbai-based Reliance would seek to expand one of the UK’s best-known retailers into India, southeast Asia and the Middle East, the Financial Times first reported.
It comes after Boots owner Walgreen Boots Alliance decided to put the chemist up for sale following a review of the business in January, as it renews its focus on the US business.
Under the plan, Reliance and Apollo would own stakes in Boots, which is understood to be valued at £5bn to £6bn, although it was not clear if they would be the same size.
Indian conglomerate Reliance is reportedly not thought likely to table a standalone bid, however.
Mr Ambani is the eighth richest person in the world and the second richest person in Asia, with an estimated net worth of more than $100bn (£80bn), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

His late father, Dhirubhai Ambani, set up a textile manufacturer that would eventually become Reliance Industries.
Separately, the billionaire Issa brothers and their private equity partner TDR have also been linked to the bidding process, which is expected to come to a head on May 16.
One of the challenges prospective suitors will have to contend with is higher borrowing costs, as debt will be required to complete the deal, as well as reassuring pension trustees that they will be good custodians for Boots’ £8bn pension scheme.
Seb James, Boots’ UK boss, insisted last week that there was still ""a lot of interest"" in the group.

Targeting that growth, Reliance is building a mall with dozens of outlets for powerhouse brands from Louis Vuitton to Gucci, documents reviewed by Reuters show.
The ritzy mall, Jio World Plaza, is the centrepiece of Reliance's bid to lure uber-rich Indians eyeing expensive bags or shoes. Luxury dominance would come on top of its number one position in India's nearly $900 billion retail market, where it faces intense competition in e-commerce and supermarkets from the likes of Amazon and Walmart.
Three people with direct knowledge of Reliance's strategy said the push is aimed at leveraging foreign brand partnerships and being ahead of retail rivals in luxury offerings.
The total cost of developing the Jio World Centre - a giant commercial and cultural hub in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla business district that houses the luxury mall - is upwards of $1 billion, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
The hefty investment by Reliance, with a market value of $238 billion, shows the drive of Ambani's family to expand in luxury - especially his 30-year-old daughter Isha, closely involved in directing the push.
""Global brands want to be here (India), Reliance is trying to drive that boom and act as a catalyst,"" said a second person with knowledge of Reliance's strategy.
The sources declined to be identified because they're not authorised to disclose Reliance's strategy publicly.
Reliance did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

MUMBAI (Reuters) -Indian lenders are set to initiate debt recovery proceedings against Future Retail this week to safeguard their interests after rival Reliance unexpectedly took over some of the retailer's stores, two bankers told Reuters.
Future, hit by the pandemic, has been struggling to pay off its debt and is fighting a bitter legal battle with U.S retail giant Amazon. That battle has successfully blocked a $3.4 billion sale of its retail assets to India's largest retailer Reliance, citing violation of certain contracts.
Future denies any wrongdoing. But Reliance Industries suddenly took control of hundreds of Future stores late last month, citing non-payment of rent, after assuming many of the leases held by cash-strapped Future.
State-owned lender Bank of Baroda will be the first to take Future to the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) and is expected to file the paperwork this week, the two bankers said.
""We are taking this step as a measure of last resort because we want to protect ourselves in this legal fiasco,"" said one of the bankers directly involved in the matter. ""Going to DRT will ensure that Reliance can't pull another sudden move.""
Other lenders are likely to follow suit, the second banker with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Future Retail and BoB did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Future Group as a whole has more than $4 billion in debt and lenders have already started classifying the loans as non-performing assets (NPA) this quarter.
Lenders are also likely to subsequently file a case in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that handles corporate insolvency cases, both bankers told Reuters. Future and Amazon are fighting it out at multiple levels, including at India's Supreme Court.
Given the legal complexities in this case, approaching the DRT first is likely to help banks attach, seize and sell Future's assets promptly, instead of going after the entire company at NCLT, Ketan Mukhija, a partner at Link Legal said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Reliance Industries Ltd, operator of the world's biggest refining complex, may avoid buying Russian fuels for its plants following Western sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, a senior company official said.
""Even if we can source some of the feeds (from Russia), probably we will be out of it because of the sanctions,"" Rajesh Rawat, senior vice president and business head cracker, told an industry event on Wednesday.
Reliance buys Urals crude and straight run fuel oil for its refineries from Russia. The private refiner mostly buys its petrochemical feedstock from the Middle East and the United States.
Sanctions on Russia have prompted many companies and countries to shun its oil, depressing Russian crude to record discount levels.
Rawat said in India most of the oil supplies from Russia are going to the state-run companies.
""So probably, those feed streams will still continue, or may have a lesser impact compared to the private sector players. Because we deal with banks, and also even if we can source some of the feeds (from Russia), probably we will be out of it because of the sanctions,"" Rawat told the Asia Refining and Petrochemical Summit.
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, India's top refiner Indian Oil Corp has bought 3 million barrels of Russian Urals crude and Hindustan Petroleum has bought 2 million barrels of the oil through tenders.

A company with greater scale typically has a broader platform of products and services and the ability to offer them to a wider range of customers, as well as more flexibility to invest in research and development. Revenue and Operating Profit are indicators of scale.Business Profile: The business profile of an aerospace and defense company is considered as it influences its ability to generate sustainable earnings and operating cash flows. Competitive position and expected revenue stability are components of business profile.Profitability and Efficiency: Profits are considered because they are needed to generate sustainable cash flow and maintain a competitive position. For an aerospace and defense company, we assess this using its operating margin which may indicate the importance of its product to customers, its ability to avoid cost overruns, its success in pricing contracts and managing its supply chain, and its overall contract execution capabilities.Leverage and Coverage: Leverage and cash flow coverage is considered and can indicate a company's financial flexibility, long-term sustainability, and resilience through business and economic cycles. Aerospace and defense companies typically need to adapt to new programs and to invest in research and development, making financial flexibility critical for long-term sustainability. Leverage and coverage can be indicated by ratios such as Debt/EBITDA, Retained Cash Flow/Net Debt, and EBIT/Interest.Financial Policy: Financial policy encompasses management and board tolerance for financial risk and commitment to a strong credit profile. It can affect debt levels, credit quality, the future direction for the company and the risk of adverse changes in financing and capital structure. Financial risk tolerance serves as a guidepost to investment and capital allocation.Other Considerations: Other considerations may include financial controls and the quality of financial reporting; corporate legal structure; the quality and experience of management; assessments of corporate governance as well as environmental and social considerations; exposure to uncertain licensing regimes; and possible government interference in some countries.

We consider the underlying demand characteristics of a company's service offerings and their relative breadth, strength, and endurance of demand. Companies that have established a long history of strong demand for a diverse range of service offerings that are critical to customer needs generally entail lower risk compared to those that offer a single line of service which have less importance for customer needs or have a limited history of success.Profitability: Profits matter because they are necessary to maintain a business's competitive position, including sufficient reinvestment in marketing, research, facilities, and human capital.

Scale also greatly influences a chemical company's market strength and the availability of capital. Additionally, scale is an important indicator of a chemical company's capacity to sustain earnings and generate cash flow. Scale can provide indications of a chemical company's other strengths, including resilience to changes in product demand, cost absorption, research and development capabilities and bargaining strength with customers and raw material suppliers. Scale is measured using total reported revenue, and net property, plant & equipment.Business Profile: The business profile of a chemical company is important because it greatly influences its ability to generate sustainable earnings and operating cash flows. Our assessment is based on our expectations for cash flow volatility. Core aspects of a chemical companyÂs business profile are its market position, product and geographic diversity, operational execution as well as technological leadership and market position prospects, all of which can reduce volatility through economic cycles.Profitability: Profitability is an important indicator of a chemical company's strength and durability and can reflect the competitiveness of its product portfolio. It provides some indication of a chemical company's ability to withstand economic downturns, reinvest in fixed assets and service debt and other obligations. Relative cost position is important for chemical companies because in cyclical or economic downturns, product prices often decline to the point where only companies with lower costs generate meaningful cash flow. Profitability can be an important indicator of how much value a company's products add and whether they are specialty in nature or commodity-like, or of its operating cost efficiency. A chemical company's operating cost position is a function of a number of characteristics that include its size, access to low-cost raw materials, location of assets, labor costs and capital invested. EBITA Margin and Return on Average Assets are indicators of profitability.Leverage and Coverage: Leverage and cash flow coverage measures provide important indications of a chemical company's financial flexibility and long-term viability. Strength in this area is an indicator of a company's investment capabilities, and its ability to withstand business cycle fluctuations and respond to unexpected challenges. Among others, ratios such as Debt/ EBITDA, Retained Cash Flow/ Debt, and EBITDA/ Interest Expense are indicators of leverage and coverage.Financial Policy: Financial policy encompasses management and board tolerance for financial risk and commitment to a strong credit profile. It is an important rating determinant, because it directly affects debt levels, credit quality, the future direction for the company and the risk of adverse changes in financing and capital structure. Financial risk tolerance serves as a guidepost for investment and capital allocation. Liquidity management is also an important aspect of overall risk management and can provide insight into risk tolerance.Other Factors: Other factors may include, but are not limited to, financial controls and the quality of financial reporting; corporate legal structure; the quality and experience of management; assessments of corporate governance as well as environmental and social considerations; exposure to uncertain licensing regimes; and possible government interference in some countries. Regulatory, litigation, liquidity, technology, and reputational risk as well as changes to consumer and business spending patterns, competitor strategies and macroeconomic trends are also considered. Sinochem International CorporationThe principal methodology used for these rated entities was Investment Holding Companies and Conglomerates published in July 2018. Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.Key rating considerations on a forward-looking basis may include but are not limited to the following summarized below.Investment Holding Companies and ConglomeratesFor Investment Holding Companies we consider the following factors:Investment Strategy: Investment strategy is considered because transparent and more conservative investment strategies can provide a longer-term view of an investment holding company's business profile, which is particularly relevant given the tendency for investment holding companies to acquire and divest assets. Greater visibility over the evolution of the company's investment portfolio is supported by clearly defined investment strategies in terms of the types of assets the company seeks to invest in, the intended tenure of its investments and the targeted composition of its investment portfolio. We assess the investment holding company's investment policies and guidelines, as well as management track record. The existence of publicly communicated goals and a commitment to adhere to these is also helpful in our assessment, particularly when a proven track record is present.Asset Quality: The asset quality of the investment portfolio represents one of the drivers of the company's credit risk. Our assessment considers investment concentration, geographic and business diversity, and portfolio transparency. The transparency and consistency of management in communicating information is a key element of our analysis. Listed investments in markets where regulatory disclosure requirements are strong can help to provide more reliable information.Financial Policy: Management and board tolerance for financial risk is considered as it directly affects debt levels, credit quality, and the risk of adverse changes in financing and capital structure. This is important given an investment holding company's exposure to equity risks, which can result in greater volatility in leverage metrics relative to other corporates. The acquisition and divestiture activities of investment holding companies also make it more challenging to estimate future leverage. Our assessment of financial policies includes the perceived tolerance of a company's governing board and management for financial risk and the future direction for the company's capital structure. Considerations also include a company's public commitments in this area, its track record for adhering to commitments, and our views on the ability for the company to achieve its targets.Estimated Market Value-Based Leverage (MVL): The majority of an investment holding company's assets are typically equity participations in subsidiaries and associates. In the event that the holding company decides to lever its equity returns by funding part of the investments through the issuance of debt, the credit risk of this debt is significantly impacted by asset values available to cover potential fixed debt charges. The MVL is measured as Net Debt/Estimated Market Value of Portfolio Assets.Debt Coverage and Liquidity: Operational cash flows that can regularly cover interest expenses reflect positively on the investment holding company's financial flexibility and long-term viability. Investment holding companies that do not have a sufficiently mature portfolio paying an adequate level of dividends to cover their interest and debt payments are more reliant upon cash and credit facilities, which we believe should be reserved for a market downturn. The timing of debt repayments can play a particularly significant role in the credit profile of an investment holding company as the concentration of maturities can present liquidity challenges and heighten refinancing risk. Debt Coverage and Liquidity is measured by ratios such as Funds from Operations plus Interest/ Interest Expense and Liquidity/Debt maturities.Other Considerations: Other considerations may include, but are not limited to, corporate governance, financial controls, liquidity management, group complexity, degree of influence over dividends of investees, event risk as well as parental and institutional support.For conglomerates we incorporate a balanced view of the credit risk in each business segment, with further consideration of the potential overall risk reduction due to industry and country diversification of assets and cashflows, portfolio stability, together with the ownership structure and the relationship between subsidiaries and the broader group.Credit Risk of Each Business Segment: We assess the individual business and credit risk profile of each major industry segment of a conglomerate by applying the scorecard from the respective industry sector methodology. In most cases, it is most meaningful to do this only for the two or three largest industry segments. Where necessary, this approach includes an allocation of the conglomerate's Holdco debt to its subsidiary businesses in order to estimate individual ratios which allow for a weighted average calculation for the total group. The weighting is usually centered around cash flow metrics (such as each major segment's contribution to EBITDA) since this can represent an approximation for the debt capacity of the various subsidiaries.Risk Reduction from Industry/Country Diversification: Business diversification within a conglomerate can bring potential benefits for creditors. At the same time, diversification exists only to the extent that correlation is low across the various businesses. We therefore take a very pragmatic and cautious approach to diversification.Portfolio Stability: The stability of a conglomerate's portfolio during a certain time period is assessed by analyzing the stability of investments in assets and their asset mix (e.g. by sector, country, or revenue vs. cash flow focus), the number of acquisitions, spin-offs, and ""greenfield"" developments. Strong discipline with clear guidance on a balanced investment strategy and limited event risk is considered as a positive step for the overall credit risk of the conglomerateOwnership Structure: The type of ownership might be a potential source of benefit for the credit assessment of the conglomerate. For example, a conglomerate with stable ownership (possibly majority remaining with a family) and a clear succession plan is assessed positively. Conversely, unclear ownership influences or weak governance structures may impair the overall rating outcome, and is assessed negatively.Relationship Between Subsidiaries and the Broader Group: There might be circumstances under which the parent holding provides specific financial support to a business which is part of the overall conglomerate. This may be accomplished, for example, through intercompany loans, equity top-ups, asset transfers, granting of financial guarantees or debt forgiveness. The overall strength of support depends on the type of measure and our assessment of the willingness and ability of the parent to grant this support. Anhui Provincial Invest. Grp. Hldg.

Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.Key rating considerations on a forward-looking basis may include but are not limited to the following summarized below.Rating Transactions Based on the Credit Substitution Approach: Letter of Credit-backed, Insured and Guaranteed DebtsThird-party credit support: The goal of third-party credit support is to substitute the credit risk of the support provider for the credit risk of the issuer. For credit substitution to be achieved, investors must be insulated from the risk of payment default by the underlying obligor. Generally, the long-term ratings on credit-supported transactions track the long-term rating assigned to the credit provider.Additional Considerations: Credit substitution requires more than just the presence of a credit support instrument from a third-party credit provider. The transaction documentation provides clear instructions to ensure that payments under the credit support facility are made when due and that there are no impediments to the timely payment of debt service. The key elements evaluated include: mitigation of bankruptcy risk of issuer; sufficiency of credit support; structural provisions which provide for the timely payment of debt service; bondholders to be paid in full if credit support expiration or termination will result in a change. LOTTE CorporationThe principal methodology used for these rated entities was Retail published in November 2021. Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.Key rating considerations on a forward-looking basis may include but are not limited to the following summarized below.RetailScale: Scale for retailers carries many benefits, from buying power with vendors to potential price leadership, both of which can result in meaningful competitive advantages versus smaller companies. Scale is measured using total reported revenue.Business Profile: In the retail industry, those companies that are characterized by selling products with relatively inelastic demand are viewed as less vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences or competitive threats than are companies that offer more discretionary products or products with more elastic demand. This business profile is based on two sub-factors: stability of product and execution & competitive position.Leverage and Coverage: Financial leverage and coverage measures are indicators of a company's financial flexibility and long-term viability. Financial flexibility is critical to retailers as they adapt their businesses to almost constant changes in consumer behavior. Among others, ratios such as Debt/ EBITDA, EBIT/ Interest Expense, and Retained Cash Flow/ Net Debt are indicators of leverage and coverage.Financial Policy: Management and board tolerance for financial risk is considered as it directly affects debt levels, credit quality, and the risk of adverse changes in financing and capital structure. Our assessment of financial policies includes the perceived tolerance of a company's governing board and management for financial risk and the future direction for the company's capital structure. Considerations include a company's public commitments in this area, its track record for adhering to commitments, and our views on the ability of the company to achieve its targets.Other Factors: Other factors may include, but are not limited to: financial controls and the quality of financial reporting; corporate legal structure; the quality and experience of management; assessments of corporate governance as well as environmental and social considerations; exposure to uncertain licensing regimes; and possible government interference in some countries. Regulatory, litigation, liquidity, technology, and reputational risk as well as changes to consumer and business spending patterns, competitor strategies and macroeconomic trends also affect ratings. China Tourism Group Corporation LimitedThe principal methodology used for these rated entities was Trading Companies published in June 2016. Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.Key rating considerations on a forward-looking basis may include but are not limited to the following summarized below.Trading CompaniesScale: Scale, as indicated through revenues and assets (fixed assets and total assets), is typically indicative of business position, ability to influence business trends and pricing, to weather the vagaries of economic cycles, and to support a stable or growing market position. Scale also can be an indicator of resilience to changes in product demand, geographic diversity, cost absorption and bargaining strength with customers and suppliers.Business Profile: Business Profile considers the strength of the company's global presence, the diversity of its products, its long-term competitiveness, the stability of its performance, its long-term viability, and its risk profile. Our assessment for Business Profile includes: (i) geographic, operational and product diversity, (ii) competitive advantages, (iii) durability of its market share and customer relationships, (iv) the stability of performance over time, (v) the competitive landscape in each key market, (vi) the threat posed by potential new entrants or technological change, (vii) the degree to which products or services are differentiated, (viii) growth strategy, and (ix) risk profile. The company's risk profile considers a broad range of issues, including the perceived likelihood that the company might undertake sizable or frequent acquisitions in new markets that would raise business risk, exposures to volatile commodity prices and management's policies and practices concerning proprietary trading. The level of vertical integration, the percentage of sales and earnings that arise from merchandising activities and the evolution of the company's business over time might also be considered.Leverage: Leverage can indicate a company's financial flexibility, long-term viability, ability to make new investments, to weather the vagaries of the business cycle and respond to unexpected challenges, to access to external funding, and to absorb the negative impact from volatile commodity prices and large shifts in consumer demand. Some indicators of leverage include: Debt/ Book Capitalization, Net Debt/ EBITDA, and Funds from Operations/ Debt.Financial Policy: Management and board tolerance for financial risk is a rating determinant as it directly affects debt levels, credit quality and the risk of adverse changes in financing and capital structure. Considerations can include a company's public commitments in this area, its track record for adhering to commitments, and views on the ability of the company to achieve its targets. Financial risk tolerance serves as a guidepost to investment and capital allocation.Other Considerations: Additional considerations also include but are not limited to: our assessment of the quality of management, corporate governance, financial controls, liquidity management, event risk and seasonality. COFCO (Hong Kong) LimitedThe principal methodology used for these rated entities was Government-Related Issuers Methodology published in February 2020. Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.Key rating considerations on a forward-looking basis may include but are not limited to the following summarized below.Government-Related Issuers MethodologyAssigning a Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA): The majority of Government-Related Issuers (GRIs) begin with an assessment of the GRI's standalone strength (i.e. BCA)  its ability to service and repay outstanding debt without recourse to extraordinary support from the supporting government - using the published sector-specific methodology that is most suitable for the predominant activities of the GRI. Our assessment of standalone strength includes any day-to-day support received from the government that can be clearly distinguished from extraordinary support. Support mechanisms, such as an obligation of the government to ensure the GRI's solvency and liquidity, are reflected in the BCA when they are legally or contractually documented.Government uplift: The GRI's ratings include any uplift due to systemic support and typically focus on three structural factors and three factors explaining the level of the government's willingness to provide support. Structural factors address the legal and quasi-legal aspects of the government's relationship with the GRI and include: (1) guarantees, (2) ownership level and (3) barriers to support. The factors underlying willingness consider the softer connections between the two entities and include (4) the likelihood of government intervention, (5) political linkages and (6) economic importance. Support is determined using a joint default analysis framework which considers an estimate of the likelihood of extraordinary support, an assessment of the credit quality of the supporting government, and default correlation between the two entities.GRIs without a BCA: In limited instances, it is not possible or meaningful to assign a BCA. The GRI is so inextricably linked to the government that a meaningful standalone BCA cannot be derived. In such cases, a top-down analytical approach is used that chiefly considers the ability and willingness of the government to provide timely support, instead of the usual bottom-up approach of starting with the BCA and then considering uplift towards the government's rating. Anhui Provincial Invest.

NEW DELHI, March 16 (Reuters) - For more than a year, Amazon.com Inc and India's Future Group have been locked in a complex legal stand-off that has stalled Future's $3.4 billion sale of assets to rival Reliance Industries , the country's biggest conglomerate.
Amazon and Future agreed to out-of-court settlement discussions this month, but the two sides told India's Supreme Court on March 15 they had failed to resolve the matter.
Following is a guide to the dispute.
THE TRIGGER
In 2019, Amazon and Future, the No. 2 player in India behind market leader Reliance, became business partners when the U.S. company invested $200 million in a unit of the Indian group.
That deal, Amazon argues, came with non-compete clauses that prohibited Future from selling retail assets to certain rivals, including Reliance, run by India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani. The deal's terms call for disputes to be settled by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre.
In 2020, Future - hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic - decided to sell assets to Reliance.
Amazon then approached Singapore arbitrators and successfully stopped the sale. Both parties have also challenged each other in Indian courts, including the Supreme Court.
THEIR ARGUMENTS
Amazon argues various agreements signed in 2019 with Future gave it special rights over Future's retail assets, some of which it had also hoped to ultimately own should India's rules for foreign investors be eased. The potential Future-Reliance deal ""destroys"" the latter prospect, the U.S. company has said.
Future denies any wrongdoing, saying Amazon is illegally seeking to exert control on Future's retail business. Future Retail - the group's flagship retail arm - says it faces liquidation if the Reliance deal fails.
THE STAKES
If Amazon were to prevail, that could set it up to become a bigger force than Reliance in India's $900 billion retail market.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian refining giant Reliance Industries has acquired the assets of battery maker Lithium Werks for $61 million, its second such deal in less than three months, as it makes a bigger push towards clean energy and transport.
Reliance's investment in Lithium Werks, which manufactures lithium iron phosphate batteries that are mainly used in electric vehicles (EVs), includes funding for future growth, the company said late on Monday.
The assets, acquired through its subsidiary Reliance New Energy, include Lithium Werks' portfolio of about 219 patents, a manufacturing facility in China, key business contracts and existing employees, it said.
The deal comes as Reliance looks to cut dependence on its mainstay oil-to-chemicals business, with plans to invest $10 billion in clean energy projects to boost its green credentials and meet its goal of net zero carbon by 2035.
Reliance agreed in December to buy Faradion, a UK-based sodium-ion battery company, for an enterprise value of 100 million pounds ($130 million). The two companies will give Reliance access to technology that will be key in its plan to manufacture batteries and battery systems in India.
""Along with Faradion, Lithium Werks will enable us to accelerate our vision of establishing India at the core of developments in global battery chemistries,"" Reliance's owner, billionaire Mukesh Ambani said in the statement.
It will allow Reliance to provide ""a high-performance supply chain"" to the growing Indian EV and energy storage markets, he added.
India is offering incentives of up to $6 billion to companies to build EVs and batteries locally as the government looks to establish a domestic supply chain for clean transport and renewable energy.

Reliance's takeover began with utmost stealth on the night of Feb. 25 when its staff began arriving at Future stores. Many in Future's management were in the dark about the plans as store employees from all over the country frantically began to call, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.
""It was tense, everybody was panicking. We didn't know who they were. They wanted access and seniors didn't know about it,"" a New Delhi Big Bazaar store employee said, describing what happened around 8 p.m. that day.
At a Future store in Sonipat town in northern Haryana state, announcements were made asking customers to leave as Reliance seized control, one source said. In Vadodara in western Gujarat, Future employees arriving for work the next morning were asked to go back home with no explanation, said another source.

""It was tense, everybody was panicking. We didn't know who they were. They wanted access and seniors didn't know about it,"" a New Delhi Big Bazaar store employee said, describing what happened around 8 p.m. that day.
At a Future store in Sonipat town in northern Haryana state, announcements were made asking customers to leave as Reliance seized control, one source said. In Vadodara in western Gujarat, Future employees arriving for work the next morning were asked to go back home with no explanation, said another source.
Citing unpaid payments by Future, Reliance has taken control of operations of some 200 Big Bazaar stores and has plans to seize another 250 of Future's retail outlets. Combined, they represent the crown jewels of Future's retail network and around a third of all Future outlets.

BENGALURU, March 3 (Reuters) - Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries said on Thursday it would invest 16.7 billion rupees ($220.70 million) to create a joint venture (JV) with U.S.-listed Sanmina Corp for making electronic products in the Asian country.

The deal comes as India pushes for more investment in the manufacturing sector in a bid to establish the country as a global electronics production hub. India has offered about $30 billion in incentives to woo electronics manufacturers to set up shop in India.
Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance will hold a 50.1% stake in the JV after the investment in Sanmina's existing Indian entity through a Reliance unit. Sanmina will contribute its existing contract manufacturing business to the JV.
The JV will service both domestic and export markets, Sanmina Chief Executive Officer Jure Sola said in a statement.
All manufacturing will initially take place at Sanmina's campus in the south Indian city of Chennai, with an option for expansion in other manufacturing sites within the country.
Sanmina, whose Indian entity Sanmina SCI India Private Ltd raked in revenue of about 12.3 billion rupees for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, looks to scale up its existing footprint in India with the deal.
Reliance has in recent years diversified away from its mainstay oil business, building its presence in the retail and telecom industries. It last year unveiled an aggressive plan to foray into green energy.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc plans to initiate criminal court proceedings this week against its Indian partner Future Retail for allowing the transfer of assets to a major rival despite a legal prohibition, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
For more than a year, Amazon and Future Group have been in a legal stand-off that has stalled Future's $3.4 billion sale of assets to Reliance Industries.
Amazon successfully halted Future's asset sale to rival Reliance since 2020 by citing violation of certain contracts.
Future, India's second largest retailer, denies any wrongdoing. Amazon's position has been backed by a Singapore arbitrator and Indian courts.
Reuters reported this week that Reliance had started to take over around 500 of Future's stores, rebranding them as its own outlets.
Reliance had previously transferred leases of some of Future's flagship supermarkets to its name, but allowed Future to continue to operate them. Reliance has now begun to take possession of them after Future failed to make rental payments to it, sources have said.
Amazon plans to initiate criminal proceedings against Future in a New Delhi court, and to urge the court to order an investigation into the matter, one of the sources, who has direct knowledge of the plans, said.
Two other sources said the lawsuit could be filed as early as this week.
Future, Amazon and Reliance did not immediately respond to Reuters' emails seeking comment.
Amazon will allege that Future concealed information during legal proceedings and allegedly transferred leases of its stores to rival Reliance, even though a Singapore arbitrator had halted any transfer or disposal of assets in the ongoing dispute, the first source added.
""This is going to be Amazon's last attempt (to stop the deal),"" said this source.
The plan to start criminal court proceedings would mark a significant escalation in the legal battle between Amazon and its Indian retail rivals - Future Retail and Reliance, which is led by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries had transferred leases of some stores to its name and sublet them to Future, but is now taking over. Reliance has offered store staff jobs on existing terms.
In blocking the Future-Reliance deal, Amazon has long argued that Future violated the terms of a 2019 deal in which the U.S. retail giant invested $200 million in the company. Amazon's position has been backed so far by a Singapore arbitrator and Indian courts.

""In the interim, till cost of green hydrogen comes down, RIL can be the first mover to establish a hydrogen ecosystem, with minimal incremental investment, in India,"" it said.
Ambani, who wants to move his group to net-zero carbon emissions by 2035, last month announced plans to invest 5.95 trillion rupees ($79 billion) to set up green energy projects including a 100 gigawatt renewable energy power plant.
The company operates the world's biggest refining complex at Jamanagar.
""Subsequently, as hydrogen from syngas is replaced by green hydrogen, the entire syngas will be converted to chemicals.""
Ambani wants to produce green hydrogen at $1 per kg before the turn of this decade.

NEW DELHI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Lenders to Future Retail , the company being fought over by Reliance Industries and Amazon.com Inc, have told India's Supreme Court that its assets should be put up for auction after it missed payments.
They also said they have started classifying loans to the country's second-largest retailer as non-performing and would have to make combined provisions of 80 billion-90 billion rupees ($1.1 billion-$1.2 billion) due to the non-payment.
""Let it be subjected to an open bid...This is the only solution,"" Rakesh Dwivedi, a lawyer acting for 30 or so of Future's lenders, told the Supreme Court judges, citing the prolonged litigation so far between Future and Amazon.
Dwivedi added that Future's two suitors - Amazon and Reliance - could then bid for the retailer's assets.
The court did not hand down any decisions on Thursday and said it will hear the matter again in due course. Future declined to comment.
Future failed to complete a planned $3.4 billion sale of its retail assets to Reliance after business partner Amazon successfully argued in arbitration and in court that the Indian retail giant violated certain non-compete contractual terms.
Future has denied any wrongdoing.
Amazon is keen to own a part of Future whenever Indian investment regulations permit but has said its plans will be soured if Future is allowed to sell its assets.
Future has said it was unable to pay 35 billion rupees ($470 million) it owed to lenders on Dec. 31 as it could not sell certain small stores due to the row with Amazon. It had hoped to use a 30-day grace period to resolve the situation, but was not able to do so.
Last month, Future filed legal action against its lenders to stop them from initiating insolvency proceedings, hoping to acquire more time to make its payments and avoid having its loans designated as non-performing which gives the banks more control over its finances.
Future, which has seen its businesses hit hard by the pandemic, has 1,700 outlets including some 900 small-sized stores, with the rest being large-format hypermarkets and fashion outlets.

BENGALURU (Reuters) -Indian shares on Friday logged their biggest weekly drop since late November as losses in technology and financial stocks outweighed the boost from consumer goods giant Hindustan Unilever's positive earnings.
The blue-chip NSE Nifty 50 index fell 0.79% to 17,617.15 and the S&P BSE Sensex dropped 0.72% to 59,037.18. The indexes had earlier declined as much as 1.5% to their lowest since early-January.
They posted a weekly loss of about 3.5% each, having fallen for four straight sessions on heavy selling from foreign investors.
Asian and European peers, as well as U.S. stock futures, were weaker as concerns over inflation and the Federal Reserve's policy tightening weighed on sentiment. [MKTS/GLOB]
However, Saurabh Mukherjea, founder of Marcellus Investment Managers, said the drop was not unusual amid economic recovery and that he was not too concerned about the correction.
""We are getting strong economic recovery globally, and naturally that is fuelling inflation, also because COVID-19 has created supply side disruptions. That will invariably lead to rate hikes, which signals that the first one-third of an economic recovery is behind us.""
The Nifty IT index lost 1.7% on Friday, its fifth straight session of losses, to post a weekly decline of 7.1%. The drop this week was its biggest since March 2020.
Bajaj Finserv, a holding company for financial services businesses, slid 5.4% and was the biggest decliner on the Nifty 50. It had ended lower on Thursday after posting a decline in quarterly profit.
Shares of Hindustan Unilever rose 2.8% after the consumer goods giant logged a rise in quarterly profit and its margins beat analyst estimates.
Automakers Maruti Suzuki India and Bajaj Auto gained 1.9% and 3.4%, respectively.

India last year finalised https://bit.ly/3fmg3p5 an incentive program to encourage companies to invest in the local manufacturing of batteries as it looks to establish a domestic supply chain for clean transport and build storage for renewable energy.
Hyundai Global Motors, engineering conglomerate Larsen & Toubro, and battery makers Amara Raja and Exide have also submitted bids, the Ministry of Heavy Industries said.
""The program envisages an investment which will boost domestic manufacturing ... and foreign direct investment in the country,"" the ministry said.
India wants to establish a total of 50 gigawatt hours (Gwh) of battery storage capacity over five years, which it expects will attract direct investment of about $6 billion.
To qualify for the incentives, companies must set up at least 5 Gwh of storage capacity and meet certain local content conditions, all of which would require a minimum investment of more than $850 million.
Ten companies have submitted bids totalling about 130 Gwh, the ministry said.
India was also encouraging global companies https://reut.rs/3ntv4K3 such as Tesla Inc, Samsung, LG Energy, Northvolt and Panasonic to invest.
Clean auto technology is a key part of India's strategy for cutting pollution in major cities and reducing oil dependence. But electric vehicles (EVs) currently make up a fraction of total sales in the country mainly due to their high price as batteries are imported.
The South Asian country wants electric cars to make up 30% of private car sales by 2030 and for electric motorcycles and scooters to make up 40% of such sales, driving demand for batteries which currently contribute about 35% to 40% of the total vehicle cost.

NEW DELHI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - For more than a year, Amazon.com Inc and India's Future Group have been locked in a complex legal stand-off that has stalled Future's $3.4 billion sale of assets to the U.S. firm's rival Reliance Industries - with no end in sight.
Here's what the dispute, seen as key to deciding who gets an upper hand in one of the world's fastest-growing retail markets https://reut.rs/2OYLmMV, is all about.
WHAT TRIGGERED THE DISPUTE?
In 2019, Amazon and Future, number two player in India behind market leader Reliance, became business partners when the U.S. company invested $200 million in a gift voucher unit of the Indian group.
That deal, Amazon argues, came with certain non-compete clauses that prohibited Future from selling retail assets to certain rivals, including Reliance, run by one of India's richest men, Mukesh Ambani. The deal also included clauses for settlement of any disputes under rules laid down by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre.
But in 2020, Future - hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic - decided to sell assets to Reliance.
Amazon then approached Singapore arbitrators and successfully stopped the sale. Both parties have also challenged each other with lawsuits in Indian courts, including the Supreme Court, since the ""seat of arbitration"" remains in New Delhi and Indian law governs the proceedings.
WHAT DO AMAZON AND FUTURE SAY?
Amazon argues various agreements signed in 2019 with Future gave it special rights over Future's retail assets, some of which it had also hoped to ultimately own should India's rules for foreign investors be eased. The potential Future-Reliance deal ""destroys"" the latter prospect, the U.S. company has said.
Future denies any wrongdoing, saying Amazon is illegally seeking to exert control on Future's retail business. Future Retail - the group's flagship retail arm - says it faces liquidation https://reut.rs/2HBGN7F and its more than 27,000 employees can become jobless if the Reliance deal fails.

NEW DELHI, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has filed fresh legal challenges in its long-running dispute with Indian retailer Future Group after the national antitrust agency suspended a 2019 deal between the two sides, leading to a halt in their arbitration, four sources told Reuters on Sunday.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) last month suspended its approval of Amazon's 2019 deal with Future, denting the U.S. e-commerce giant's attempts to block the sale of Future's retail assets to Indian market leader Reliance Industries.
The suspension https://reut.rs/34DDiJf jolted Amazon as subsequently a New Delhi court halted the arbitration proceedings https://reut.rs/33d4ZYr between the two sides.
Late on Saturday night, Amazon filed an appeal against the CCI suspension decision at India's National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, two of the sources said.
Separately, two other sources said, Amazon also filed a challenge in the Supreme Court against the Delhi court https://reut.rs/33d4ZYr decision in which judges last week that said Future-Amazon arbitration proceedings must remain on hold until Feb. 1 in light of the antitrust suspension of the deal.
Amazon and the CCI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The filings are the latest in the bitter legal dispute which has embroiled Amazon, Future and Reliance over what is seen as a battle for retail supremacy in India's booming consumer market.
Reliance, run by one of India's richest men Mukesh Ambani, wants to expand its footprint by acquiring debt-laden Future, but Amazon has told India's antitrust body https://reut.rs/3G8WbkU it believes Reliance's consolidated position ""will further restrict competition in the Indian retail market"".
Amazon has long argued that Future violated the terms of its 2019 deal in deciding to sell retail assets to Reliance. The U.S. company's position has so far been backed by the Singapore arbitrator and Indian courts. Future denies any wrongdoing.
But after the CCI suspended that deal's approval, saying Amazon suppressed information while seeking clearances for the deal, Future has argued Amazon no longer has any legal basis to pursue the dispute.
Both of Amazon's appeals, to the Indian tribunal and Supreme Court, are likely to be heard in coming days, two of the sources said. (Reporting by Aditya Kalra in New Delhi; Editing by Ana Nicolaci da Costa and Lincoln Feast.)"

Demand for services like Dunzo and SoftBank-backed Swiggy's Genie boomed during the pandemic when people were ordered indoors and only delivery of essential items was allowed.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Reliance Industries Ltd has raised $4 billion in U.S dollar bonds, in the country's largest ever foreign currency bond deal, according to a term sheet seen by Reuters.
The Indian conglomerate raised $1.5 billion in a 10-year tranche, $1.75 billion in a 30-year and $750 million in a 40-year deal.
Orders for the deal reached $7.25 billion and each of the tranches was primarily bought by Asian investors, the term sheet showed.
It was the largest ever foreign currency bond transaction in India, according to Dealogic figures, eclipsing the previous record set by ONGC Videsh in 2014 when it raised $2.2 billion in U.S. dollar bonds.
Part of the cash raised by Reliance will be used to refinance $1.5 billion worth of debt due to mature in February, the term sheet said.
Reliance did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
But it confirmed the fundraising in a statement to stock exchanges on Thursday. Reliance said the proceeds from the issuance of notes will be utilised primarily for refinancing of existing borrowings, adding that the notes were nearly three times oversubscribed with peak orderbook aggregating $11.5 billion.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's Axis Bank has started offering structured derivative products to leading companies including Reliance Industries after a ban on these deals was lifted by the Reserve Bank of India effective Monday.
Axis Bank, India's third-largest private sector bank said the first of these transactions was executed with Reliance Industries which involved the use of Barrier FX options for their currency risk management, it said in a statement.
The bank also concluded another transaction with Supreme Petrochem Ltd.
Hundreds of Indian corporates who had entered into such tailor-made, OTC contracts with banks prior to 2008, cried foul when their bets went sour.
After the derivative losses — where banks also took a hit due to customers not honouring deals - the central bank banned exotic products, allowing only plain-vanilla currency options before lifting the bank with stricter guidelines last year.
""We expect the usage of these products to grow over time as the market matures and clients get more accustomed,"" said Neeraj Gambhir, Group Executive and Head – Treasury at Axis Bank.
""What has changed is the focus on risk management and customer education. Customers need to fully understand the risk reward of the transactions they are entering into. It may see a tapered pick up and growth, but the market should develop,"" he told Reuters.
Gambhir said the structured deals offered in India are still basic compared with those in global markets and there would need to be more customer education before smaller corporates get on board.
Axis Bank plans to focus on larger companies for the time being but is keen to be a frontrunner in structured derivatives and has put in place the necessary staff and infrastructure, he added.

In addition, Moody's expects the company to generate sufficient cash flows from operations each year to fund its capital spending.The stable outlook reflects Moody's expectation that the company's earnings will continue to improve over the next 12-18 months across all its business segments, such that its credit metrics will remain strongly positioned for its ratings.The stable outlook is also in line with the stable outlook of the Indian sovereign rating and reflects Moody's view that RIL cannot be rated more than one notch above the Indian sovereign.RIL has excellent liquidity.","Rating Action: Moody's assigns Baa2 rating to RIL's proposed USD bondsGlobal Credit Research - 04 Jan 2022Singapore, January 04, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service has today assigned a Baa2 rating to the proposed USD-denominated senior unsecured bonds to be issued by Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). The outlook on the rating is stable.RIL will use the bond proceeds for refinancing.""RIL's Baa2 ratings reflect the company's large scale and dominant market position across its diverse businesses, its management's strong execution track record and our expectation that its credit metrics will remain strongly positioned for its Baa2 rating, despite its planned investments in clean energy and other business segments,"" says Sweta Patodia, a Moody's Analyst.""RIL's high dependence on the Indian economy through its digital services and retail businesses constrains its rating to one notch above that of the Indian sovereign rating,"" adds Patodia, who is also Moody's lead analyst for RIL.RATINGS RATIONALERIL benefits from diversified earnings sources that have little or no correlation, given its presence in the refining and petrochemicals, digital services, and consumer retail segments. These three segments together generated around INR944 billion ($12.6 billion) or 86% of RIL's consolidated EBITDA for the 12 months ended 30 September 2021.The company's digital services and consumer retail businesses are housed under separate subsidiaries, while its refining and the petrochemical business -- also known as the oil-to-chemical (O2C) segment -- is held at the holding company level.RIL's announcement to increase tariffs for its digital services business is positive for the telecommunications industry, while the easing of pandemic-related disruptions will support demand for oil and gas as well as increase consumer spending. These trends bode well for RIL's various business segments and will keep earnings strong over the next 12-18 months.A resurgence of coronavirus infections due to the emergence of new variants could result in fresh lockdowns and affect the company's O2C and retail earnings.RIL's earlier announcements to transfer its gasification undertaking into a wholly-owned subsidiary while reevaluating the planned transfer of its O2C business to a separate subsidiary will not have any impact on the company's credit profile.RIL's adjusted net debt/EBITDA was estimated at around 1.1x as of 30 September 2021, compared with the rating downgrade trigger of net debt/EBITDA at 3.0x. In addition, Moody's expects the company to generate sufficient cash flows from operations each year to fund its capital spending.The stable outlook reflects Moody's expectation that the company's earnings will continue to improve over the next 12-18 months across all its business segments, such that its credit metrics will remain strongly positioned for its ratings.The stable outlook is also in line with the stable outlook of the Indian sovereign rating and reflects Moody's view that RIL cannot be rated more than one notch above the Indian sovereign.RIL has excellent liquidity. As of 30 September 2021, the company had adjusted cash and cash equivalents, including quoted marketable securities, of about INR1.9 trillion ($25.6 billion).Its existing cash, along with expected cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to cover its cash outflows for capital spending and debt maturities in the next 18 months.In November 2021, RIL received around INR266 billion in proceeds from the final call on its rights issue, which further enhances its liquidity.The company's liquidity is further supported by its strong banking relationships and access to domestic and international capital markets.ENVIRONMENT, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) CONSIDERATIONSRIL is exposed to increasing environmental regulations and safety risks through its refining and petrochemical businesses, which are among the few sectors that Moody's has identified as facing very high environmental risks. These risks are somewhat mitigated by the company's good track record of environmental compliance and solid operational capabilities.The company has also announced a $10 billion capital spending program in clean energy investments to be incurred over the next three years, in line with its target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035. It has recently announced a series of acquisitions in the clean energy sector as part of this investment program.RIL's petrochemical business is exposed to increasing social risks stemming from changing consumer preferences and the Indian government's initiative to reduce the consumption of single-use plastics. This risk is largely mitigated by RIL's diverse petrochemical business, which produces not only plastics with advanced applications, but also elastomers and polyester yarns and fibers.Moody's also regards the coronavirus pandemic as a social risk under its ESG framework, given the substantial implications for public health and safety. The virus outbreak has led to a decline in demand for transportation fuel, weakened refining margins, and a slowdown in consumer retail spending, which have affected RIL's earnings performance.RIL is also exposed to governance-related risks because of its concentrated ownership by its promoter, which holds a stake of around 50.6% in the company. However, RIL's status as a listed company and the fact that independent directors form the majority of the company's board mitigate this risk.In addition, the investments made by several major global investors and technology firms in RIL's digital services and retail businesses support the company's higher governance standards.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSCredit metrics indicative of a higher rating level include retained cash flow (RCF)/net debt above 25%, net debt/EBITDA below 2.0x, and EBITDA/interest above 7x, all on a sustained basis.However, RIL's ratings can be upgraded only if the sovereign rating is upgraded, because the company's ratings are capped at one notch above the sovereign's.RIL's credit metrics are extremely strong for its sovereign-constrained rating, and only a very substantial deterioration in the credit metrics could pressure its fundamental credit profile. Such deterioration could occur if (1) there is a protracted weakness in its operations, which results in significantly lower earnings, or (2) RIL increases its capital spending or makes large acquisitions or shareholder distributions that substantially increase its net borrowings.Credit metrics indicative of such a scenario include RCF/net debt below 20%, adjusted net debt/EBITDA above 3.0x, and EBITDA/interest below 4x.Moody's could also downgrade RIL's rating if the Indian sovereign rating is downgraded.The principal methodology used in these ratings was Investment Holding Companies and Conglomerates published in July 2018 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1125855. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) is an Indian conglomerate with a presence in the refining and marketing, petrochemical, digital services, and retail businesses.

NEW DELHI, Dec 17 (Reuters) - India's antitrust agency suspended Amazon.com's 2019 deal with Future Group on Friday, potentially denting the U.S. e-commerce giant's attempts to block the sale of Future's retail assets to an Indian market leader.
The regulator ruled that the U.S. company had suppressed information while seeking regulatory approval on an investment into Indian retailer Future Group two years ago.
The ruling by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) could have far-reaching consequences for Amazon's legal battles with now estranged partner Future.
Amazon has for months successfully used the terms of its toehold $200 million investment in Future in 2019 to block the Indian retailer's attempt to sell retail assets to Reliance Industries for $3.4 billion.
The regulator's 57-page order said it considers ""it necessary to examine the combination (deal) afresh,"" adding its approval from 2019 ""shall remain in abeyance"" until then.
The CCI's order said Amazon had ""suppressed the actual scope"" of the deal and had made ""false and incorrect statements"" while seeking approvals.
""The approval is suspended. This is absolutely unprecedented,"" said Shweta Dubey, a partner at Indian law firm SD Partners, who was formerly a CCI official.
""The order seems to have found new power for CCI to keep the combination approval in abeyance,"" she added.
With the 2019 Future deal's antitrust approval now suspended, it could dent Amazon's legal position and retail ambitions, while making it easier for Reliance - the country's largest retailer - to acquire number two player Future, people familiar with the dispute said.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is reviewing its prior approval of the $200 million investment the U.S. company made in a Future unit in 2019, amid allegations that Amazon concealed facts when it sought approval for the transaction.
The CCI's review was triggered after a complaint from Amazon's now estranged partner Future. The two sides have been at loggerheads since last year with the U.S. company successfully using the terms of its toehold investment in 2019 to block debt-laden Future's attempt to sell retail assets to Reliance Industries for $3.4 billion.
While Future is staring at liquidation, the legitimacy of the small $200 million deal could have far-reaching consequences for India's retail sector.
If Amazon prevails, it will slow Reliance's plan to acquire Future at a time when it is already rapidly expanding into e-commerce.
And if the 2019 deal is voided, it could make it easier for Reliance to close the Future deal, hurting Amazon's retail ambitions, people familiar with the dispute say.
Amazon in a confidential filing on Dec. 12 said CCI's approval revocation is ""bound to send a message to foreign investors that the economy and regulatory landscape of India are still not developed enough to provide stability and certainty to foreign investments"".
Amazon in its 60-page submission went on to say Future's aim ""to unwind the investment"" to allow Reliance to consolidate its position ""will further restrict competition in the Indian retail market"".

The partnership will also explore business models such as mobility as a service and battery as a service to help speed up EV adoption in the country.
Currently, EVs make up only a fraction of the country's auto sales, mainly due to high battery costs and the lack of charging infrastructure.
Jio-bp said in October that it had started offering services for charging and battery swapping for electric vehicles in India.
Mahindra is also looking to bolster its EV business and has been considering raising funds or carving it out as a separate unit. The company expects electric vehicles to account for about 20% of its volumes in India by 2027.

India, the world's second-biggest telecoms market with more than a billion subscribers, must migrate from 2G to 4G and then to 5G at the earliest, Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries and Asia's richest man, said during the Indian Mobile Congress.
""At Jio, we are currently focused on 4G and 5G execution, and broadband infrastructure expansion.""
His comments come a week after a top government official said that India is planning to auction 5G airwaves early next year.
Jio, which counts Alphabet's Google, Facebook, Qualcomm and Intel among its backers, is confident of being the first to launch 5G services in India, Ambani said previously.
As part of its technology push, Jio has also developed a homegrown 5G solution.
Google, which last year invested $4.5 billion in Jio's parent Jio Platforms, has also said it will help the wireless carrier with tech solutions for its enterprise and consumer offerings as it plans to launch 5G services.
Reliance last month launched 4G device jointly developed with Google, priced at 6,499 rupees ($86), as part of a plan to woo first-time smartphone buyers. The device costs 1,999 rupees upfront and users can pay the rest in monthly instalments.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's household goods salesmen have threatened to disrupt supplies to mom-and-pop stores if consumer companies provide products at lower prices to Reliance Industries, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Reuters reported last month https://reut.rs/3FAVZKK Indian salesmen representing companies such as Reckitt Benckiser, Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive said their sales had dropped 20-25% in the last year as mom-and-pop stores were increasingly partnering with Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance.
Ambani's deeply discounted offerings were prompting more stores to order digitally from his JioMart Partner app, posing an existential threat to more than 450,000 company salesmen who for decades served every corner of the vast nation by going store-to-store to take orders.
Citing the Reuters story, the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation - which has 400,000 members - has written to consumer companies demanding a level playing field, saying they must get products at same prices like other big corporate distributors such as Reliance.
If the pricing-parity demand is not met, the group said in its letter, its salesmen will stop distribution of products to mom-and-pop stores, and will also not supply newly launched consumer goods if such partnerships continue beyond Jan 1.
""We have earned reputation and goodwill amongst our retailers by giving them good service for many years ... We have decided to call a 'Non-cooperation' movement,"" said the letter.
The group's president, Dhairyashil Patil, said the letter was sent to Reckitt, Hindustan Unilever, Colgate and 20 other consumer goods companies.
None of the three consumer companies, as well as Reliance, responded to requests for comment.
Mom-and-pop stores, or ""kiranas"", account for 80% of a near-$900 billion https://reut.rs/2OYLmMV retail market in India. About 300,000 such stores in 150 cities order goods from Reliance, with the company setting a target of 10 million partner stores by 2024.

India's richest man has been forced to deny he is preparing a bid for BT after shares in the former state telecoms monopoly surged on speculation of a takeover tussle between international billionaires.
Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries said a report in India’s Economic Times was ""speculative and baseless"", easing a rally that pushed up shares by as much as a tenth on Monday morning.
Reliance was reportedly weighing whether to either buy BT, take a controlling stake or help fund the full-fibre rollout of BT's broadband network operator Openreach.
A spokesman for Reliance ""categorically denied any intent to bid for the UK telecoms group"".
A tilt could have thrust India's biggest conglomerate that spans energy, telecoms, online retail and digital services into a potential bidding war with Patrick Drahi, BT's largest shareholder, who is rumoured to be preparing a takeover approach for the telecoms operator.
Mr Drahi founded the French broadband challenger Altice and has a reputation as an aggressive cost-cutter.
He became BT's biggest investor in June after taking a 12pc stake. A lock-up preventing Mr Drahi from buying more shares or making a takeover offer expires on Dec 11.
A separate report from the Mail on Sunday claimed a number of buyout companies and infrastructure funds, including CVC, Apax, Brookfield and Macquarie, had completed new analysis of Openreach that valued the business at £40bn.
BT opted earlier this month not to bring in an outside investor to bolster its ultra-fast broadband upgrade after the cost of upgrading its ageing copper network fell 5pc to between £250 and £350 per premises.
BT’s plan to upgrade 25m homes and business to full-fibre by 2026 is now being solely delivered by Openreach.
Shares closed 6.1pc higher at 163.4p, making it the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 and valuing the company at £16.2bn.
Mr Ambani, who has a net worth of $94bn (£70bn), has been diversifying Reliance beyond its ownership of the world's largest refiner of crude oil to challenge Amazon and Walmart in India's fast-growing online retail market.

Future has said the arbitrator's suspension order was invalid but Indian courts have declined to overturn it.

NEW DELHI/DUBAI (Reuters) -Reliance Industries and Saudi Aramco have called off a deal for the state oil giant to buy a stake in the oil-to-chemicals business of the Indian conglomerate due to valuation concerns, sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Talks broke down over how much Reliance's oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business should be valued as the world seeks to move away from fossil fuels and reduce emissions, they said.
Instead, Reliance will now focus on signing multiple deals with companies to produce specialty chemicals for higher margins, one of the sources said.
Aramco, the world's top oil exporter, signed a non-binding agreement to buy a 20% stake in Reliance's O2C business for $15 billion in 2019. Last week, the companies announced they would re-evaluate the deal https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/reliance-aramco-re-evaluate-stake-sale-oil-to-chemicals-arm-2021-11-19, ending two years of negotiations.
The collapse of the deal reflects the changing global energy landscape as oil and gas companies shift away from fossil fuel to renewables. Valuations of refining and petrochemical assets have gone down especially after the recent COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, a second source involved in the deal discussions said.
Despite this, Reliance had stuck to the $75 billion valuation for the O2C business made in 2019, he said.
""Evaluation by consultants showed a significant cut in valuation...more than a 10% cut,"" he added.
""Reliance has highlighted the difficulty of separating Jamnagar from the clean energy business as a reason to not complete the transaction, although we suspect business alignment and valuation were also key reasons,"" Bernstein wrote in a recent note, referring to Reliance's huge refining complex in Gujarat state.
A second source familiar with due diligence said the procedure was halted in ""early stage assessment"". Reliance was seeking advice from Goldman Sachs and Aramco was seeking help from Citigroup, sources said. The banks declined to comment.

Future Retail, which runs popular Big Bazaar outlets in India, denies having violated any contractual agreements with Amazon.

As in previous court filings, Future said its bank loans and thousands of jobs remain at risk and a failure to conclude the Reliance deal could push it into liquidation.
The Singapore panel put the Future-Reliance deal on hold last year and in October declined Future Retail's request to revoke that decision. Subsequently, a Delhi court also declined to give Future any immediate relief under Indian law to put the panel's decision on hold.
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.
The U.S. company has repeatedly argued that Future Retail must not proceed with the Reliance deal in light of the arbitration panel's decisions.

NEW DELHI, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Reliance Industries said on Friday its low-cost 4G smartphone, jointly developed by the Indian group's Jio telecoms venture and Alphabet's Google, will launch in stores from this festive season of Diwali for 6,499 rupees ($87).
The smartphone, the product of a $4.5 billion Google investment in Reliance's digital unit last year, will cost 1,999 rupees upfront and users can pay the rest in monthly instalments, Reliance said in a statement.
The device comes with a tweaked Android operating system named Pragati, which means progress, and is aimed at first-time smartphone buyers with features such as quick translations in 10 Indian languages and a voice assistant which can read that text out aloud from the screen.
Google CEO Sundar Pichai said this week that the device partnership with Jio was about investing in local languages, other than English, so that many more Indians can use smartphones.
""So I view it (the phone) as laying the foundation... And, you know, I think over a three- to five-year time frame, it will end up having a lot of impact,"" Pichai said in Alphabet's third-quarter earnings call.
The Jio-Google smartphone's pricing will also pose a major challenge to Chinese vendors such as Xiaomi and BBK Electronics, owner of the Realme, Oppo and Vivo brands, which currently dominate an over $2 billion market for sub-$100 smartphones in India, the world's second biggest smartphone market. https://reut.rs/3pPvhcI
Jio also aims to use the phone to poach 2G users from rivals Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel.

NEW DELHI, Oct 27 (Reuters) - India's Future Retail has asked a Delhi court to quash a decision by a Singapore arbitration panel that has kept the $3.4 billion sale of Future's retail assets in limbo while the panel hears objections from Amazon.com Inc.
Amazon has mounted legal challenges https://reut.rs/2JcHaGd against Future's planned asset sale to market leader Reliance Industries since last year, accusing the company of violating certain contracts by doing so. Future denies any wrongdoing.
A Singapore arbitrator last year put the Future-Reliance deal on hold, and the panel last week declined Future's request https://reut.rs/3Bqxgq4 to revoke that decision. On Wednesday, Future asked the Delhi High Court to intervene and quash the arbitrator's decision according to Indian law, its legal filing seen by Reuters shows.
""The Arbitral Tribunal erroneously rejected FRL's (Future Retail) contention,"" its filing stated. ""FRL submits that the standards applied by the Arbitral Tribunal ... are incorrect.""
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Future is India's second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores and has warned that failure to strike the deal with Reliance could push it into liquidation.
The dispute started when Future, hamstrung by an economic hit from the COVID-19 pandemic, entered into a deal last year to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and certain other businesses to Reliance.
Amazon had its sights on ultimately owning some of Future's retail assets itself. It has argued a 2019 deal it had with a Future unit contained clauses prohibiting the Indian group from selling its retail assets to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list that included Reliance.
The outcome of the tussle involving two of the world's richest men, Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Reliance's Mukesh Ambani, is seen as reshaping https://reut.rs/3mkaGeh India's pandemic-hit shopping sector and deciding whether Amazon can blunt Reliance's dominance of the country's nearly trillion-dollar retail market.

MUMBAI (Reuters) -The retail unit of Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries has acquired a 52% stake in popular designer labels of Ritu Kumar, the company said on Tuesday, in the latest bet on the country's fast-expanding luxury designer market.
Reliance Retail did not disclose financial details of the transaction, but said its majority stake acquisition included buying out the 35% stake held by Everstone Capital in India's Ritika Pvt Ltd, the company that owns Ritu Kumar brands.
""We are looking at the top 20 million customers in India. Not 1.3 billion. The discretionary wallet spend on products of the top 20 million customers is what we remain focused on,"" Darshan Mehta, CEO of Reliance Brands, which manages such luxury partnerships for the group, told Reuters in an interview.
""If there is opportunity to be acquisitive in nature and a whole host of things are right, we're there.""
Kumar - best known for her ethnic designs - runs her flagship namesake brand, with her list of customers including top Bollywood actors Aishwarya Rai and Priyanka Chopra.
Some of Kumar's wedding outfits are priced as high as 800,000 rupees ($10,660), according to her website.
Just last week, Reliance bought a 40% stake in a fashion house run by another popular Indian designer, Manish Malhotra. And in January, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail bought a 51% stake in the Sabyasachi brand, best known for its high-end wedding wear.
After being battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, India's retail and luxury market is making a comeback. With high pent-up demand, Darshan said India's ongoing festive season is ""possibly going to be the finest"" as consumption will surge in the next four to five months.
Reliance Retail, the country's biggest retailer run by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, also has partnerships with global brands such as Burberry and Jimmy Choo through joint ventures and franchises.

(MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)
Newcastle United has been taken over by a Saudi Arabian-backed fund, ending retail tycoon Mike Ashley’s 14 years as club owner.
The Sports Direct boss bought the club for £134m ($182m) in 2007 but the Premier League has now approved a £305m bid from Public Investment Fund (PIF) following assurances that the Saudi state would not be in control.
Although Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, is a chair of PIF, it is seen as separate to the state. This has put aside concerns of 'sportswashing' by Saudi Arabia after the state was accused of human rights abuses.
According to Western intelligence agencies, the crown prince ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, although this has been denied by bin Salman.
The group will provide 80% of funds for the deal, and is leading a consortium made up of PCP Capital Partners and RB Sports & Media.
Due to PIF having assets of about £300bn, the takeover makes Newcastle now one of the richest clubs in the world.
Who is PIF?
The Saudi PIF is regarded as one of the world’s biggest sovereign wealth funds, and reinvests the country's oil revenues around the world.
Sovereign wealth funds spread the risk of their investments by buying assets in developed countries where legal rules protect them from arbitrary changes to property rights.
Chaired by the Crown Prince, the company is also headed by Yasir Al-Rumayyan, who sits on the boards of Uber (UBER), SoftBank Group (SFTBY) and Reliance Industries (RELIANCE.NS), which is the largest publicly traded company in India.
Al-Rumayyan, 51, who is also on the board of state oil company Saudi Aramco (2222.SR), will serve as non-executive chairman of Newcastle United.

PIF, established in 1971, began snapping up a number of high-profile investments about six years ago. It acquired an almost 40% stake in South Korea’s Posco Engineering and Construction company in 2015, followed by a 5% holding in Uber in 2016 for $3.5bn.

Reliance Industries CEO Mukesh Ambani, who has a net worth of $99.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has announced plans to bring the convenience store chain to the country after a previous franchise deal fell through.
The first store is set to open in Mumbai two days from now, covering two stories and 1,700 square feet.
The conglomerate's Reliance Retail subsidary steps in for rival Future Retail, which recently ended a two-year agreement with 7-Eleven. Reliance says it plans to open several more locations around cash-rich Mumbai and the rest of the country. (Reliance Industries ranks No. 155 on the 2021 Fortune Global 500.)
“India is the second-largest country in the world and has one of the fastest-growing economies,” said Joe DePinto, 7-Eleven’s president and CEO, in a statement. “It’s an ideal time for the largest convenience retailer in the world to make our entry into India.”
Given India’s population of 1.4 billion people, the country is seen as an area of huge potential growth for both the convenience store and Reliance Retail.
7-Eleven initially had planned to open its first India location in 2019, but delays, followed by the pandemic, prevented that. India marks the 18th country where 7-Eleven will operate. The chain has nearly 4,000 stores in the U.S. alone and over 77,000 globally.
Grocery is a $380 billion industry in India, according to the USDA Foreign Agriculture Service. Most of that goes to smaller stores, but the market for corporate chains is growing quickly.
India has already seen a number of large U.S. companies invest in the country in recent years. Walmart in 2018 spent $16 billion to buy Flipkart Online Services Pvt. And Amazon has invested in offline retailers, such as Shopper’s Stop.

Irving, Texas-based 7-Eleven Inc, known for its iconic products including the Slurpee, operates and franchises more than 77,000 stores in 18 countries and regions.
Future Retail said on Tuesday it had mutually terminated an agreement with 7-Eleven as the companies were not able to meet targets of opening stores and paying franchisee fees.
In 2019, Future Retail - India's second-largest retailer with more than 1,700 stores, including the popular Big Bazaar supermarkets and local chains Food Hall and Nilgiris - had said it plans to set up 7-Eleven stores from scratch and convert some of its existing operations into the U.S. brand.
The unit formed to run 7-Eleven stores in India had reported a loss of 173 million rupees without opening any stores, Future Retail's annual report showed.
Reliance's shares rose 1.22% in morning trade, while Future Retail stock gained 3.7% in a strong market.

It previously bought stakes in a number of overseas exploration and manufacturing assets, and in June it entered an agreement with Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) to build a multi-billion dollar chemical project in Ruwais, marking the group's first investment in a greenfield overseas project.
Reliance Industries in June announced the appointment of Saudi Aramco Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan as a director of Reliance's board and said this was the ""beginning of the internationalisation of Reliance"". The group hopes to formalise this year a deal to sell a 20% stake in its oil-to-chemical business to Aramco.

The U.S. pension fund held 5.3 million fully and partly paid shares of Reliance Industries, as of June 30, 2020, according to the last available disclosure on its website.
CalSTRS' voting decision is based on U.S. proxy advisory research firm Glass Lewis' recommendation, BloombergQuint reported on Friday.
Reliance, owned by billionaire Ambani, had appointed Aramco's Yasir Al-Rumayyan as an independent director on July 19 in the process of formalising a deal it had struck with the Saudi Arabian company to sell 20% stake in its oil-to-chemicals business.
The shareholders' voting process to confirm Al-Rumayyan's appointment as independent director, for a period of three years, will end on Oct. 19.
Glass Lewis, which makes voting recommendations to more than 1,200 investors across the world, had recommended voting against Al-Rumayyan ""based on the director's status as an independent director"" of RIL, the report added.
Reliance, CalSTRS and Glass Lewis did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for a comment.
The Indian conglomerate had announced the sale for $15 billion in 2019 to Aramco, the world's top oil exporting firm, though the deal was stalled after the coronavirus crisis dented oil prices and fuel demand.
Last month, Bloomberg News reported that an agreement between Reliance and Aramco could be reached in the coming weeks. At Aramco's earnings briefing in August, Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser had said the company was still doing due diligence on the Reliance deal.
Al-Rumayyan is the chairman of Aramco's Board of Directors and has been the governor of the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia since 2015.

The ""ultra-affordable"" smartphone, developed jointly by Reliance's telecom arm and Google, was set to be rolled out from Sept. 10.
Companies globally are tackling a massive semiconductor shortage as the COVID-19 pandemic-led shift to remote working drove demand for the critical component used in making laptops and phones. As a fallout, several automakers have also suspended production.
""Both the companies have begun testing JioPhone Next with a limited set of users for further refinement and are actively working to make it available more widely in time for the Diwali festive season,"" Jio said in an exchange filing https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/e186d89b-7499-4163-bf5e-bdfcfcc8bdae.pdf late on Thursday.
The annual festive season in India typically lasts for 30 days, beginning in October and ending with Diwali — set for Nov. 4 this year. Indians usually make big-ticket purchases from jewellery to gadgets and cars around this period.
The additional time will also help mitigate the current industry-wide global semiconductor shortages, Jio added.
In June, when the phone was announced, Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani did not specify its price but said it will be the most affordable smartphone ""not just in India, but globally"".
Jio disrupted India's telecom market in 2016 when it launched with cut-price data plans and free voice services, forcing several competitors out of the market. It is now India's biggest mobile carrier with more than 425 million customers.
Ambani had also said in June that Jio, which counts Facebook, Qualcomm and Intel among its backers, was confident of being the first to launch 5G services in India.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's top court on Thursday ordered authorities to withhold any final decision on Future Group's sale of $3.4 billion of retail assets for four weeks, prolonging its dispute with Amazon.com Inc which has challenged the deal.
Amazon has for months argued Future violated certain contracts by selling its assets to Reliance Industries, an allegation the Indian retailer denies. The dispute has been taken before courts in India and an arbitrator in Singapore.

The outcome of the tussle involving two of the world's richest men, Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Reliance's Mukesh Ambani, could reshape India's nearly trillion-dollar retail market if Amazon succeeds in weakening Reliance's dominance.

NEW DELHI, Aug 6 (Reuters) - India's top court on Friday handed Amazon.com Inc a major victory in a dispute where it sought to block its partner Future Group from selling $3.4 billion in assets to rival Reliance Industries.
The outcome of the tussle involving two of the world’s richest men, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Reliance’s Mukesh Ambani, is seen reshaping India’s pandemic-hit shopping sector https://www.reuters.com/article/amazon-india-future-reliance-idUSKBN2871AM and deciding if Amazon can blunt Reliance's dominance of the country's nearly trillion-dollar retail market.
Amazon and Future have been locked in legal battles https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-india-future-reliance-idUSKBN2AM0HN over the Future Group deal, with the U.S. firm accusing the Indian group of violating pre-existing contracts when it sold its assets to Reliance. Future has denied any wrongdoing.
A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court said that an interim decision by a Singapore arbitrator in October - that put the deal on hold after finding merit in Amazon's objections - was valid and enforceable in India.
Amazon had argued that the order is binding, while Future had argued it was not. Both sides had agreed to use the Singapore arbitrator in case of disputes when Amazon invested $200 million in a unit of Future in 2019. The arbitration proceedings are still ongoing.
Shares in Future Retail were up 6% ahead of the ruling, but tanked 10% and hit a lower-circuit breaker in Mumbai trading after the order. Reliance Industries fell as much as 2.3%.
Future Retail said in a statement it had been ""advised that it has remedies available in law, which it will exercise."" It did not elaborate on the legal options, but said it will take steps to conclude the deal and protect the interests of its stakeholders and workforce.

BENGALURU (Reuters) -Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd reported a 58% jump in quarterly revenue on Friday, led by a strong show at its dominant oil and gas business.
India's most valuable company, which operates the world's biggest refining complex at Jamnagar in western India, benefited from a sharp increase in product prices on the back of higher crude prices. Brent prices surged 18.2% in the June quarter due to tight supplies.
""Stronger oil fundamentals, vaccination programs and better demand outlook have resulted in a steady rise in crude prices throughout the first quarter,"" the company, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, said in a statement.
Revenue surged to 1.44 trillion rupees, fueled by an over 70% jump in the oil-to-chemicals business.
Consolidated profit, however, fell to 122.73 billion rupees ($1.65 billion) in the quarter ended June 30, from 132.33 billion rupees a year earlier, mainly hit by a rise in tax expenses.
Jio, the company's telecom operations, added 14.3 million customers as of June end, fewer than the 15.4 million in the previous quarter.
The company has used up nearly all airwaves it won, and additional airwaves have been used to create capacity for the next 200 million customers on the network, an executive said on a post-earnings conference call.
Reliance has been diversifying from its core oil and gas business as it focuses on retail and telecoms.
The retail network, which consists of more than 12,000 stores and supermarkets, reported a near 50% drop in footfall in the first quarter from the previous three months as the second wave of COVID-19 ravaged the country.
""COVID-related restrictions on store operations during the quarter impacted our retail business operations and profitability,"" Chairman Ambani said in a statement.
""This is a temporary phenomenon,"" he added.
