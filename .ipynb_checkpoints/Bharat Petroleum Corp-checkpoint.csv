Updated: 08 Jun 2022,Russia has no extra oil to sign deals with two Indian buyers: Report,https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/russia-has-no-extra-oil-to-sign-deals-with-two-indian-buyers-report-11654698191644.html,"NEW DELHI : Russia's Rosneft is holding back on signing new crude oil deals with two Indian state refiners, three sources with knowledge of the matter said, as it has committed sales to other customers. Indian refiners have been snapping up cheap Russian oil, shunned by western companies and countries since sanctions were imposed against Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, which Russia calls a ""special military operation"". A lack of new term supply deals with Rosneft may push Indian refiners to turn to the spot market for more expensive oil. It also indicates that Russia has managed to keep exporting its oil despite increasing pressure from Western sanctions to choke Moscow's revenue. Drawn to the discounts offered, three Indian state refiners - Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum - opened negotiations with Rosneft earlier this year for six-month supply deals. So far only IOC, the country's top refiner, has signed a deal with Rosneft, which will see it buy 6 million barrels of Russian oil every month, with an option to buy 3 million barrels more. The other two refiners' requests have since been turned down by the Russian producer, the sources said. ""Rosneft is non-committal in signing a contract with HPCL and BPCL. They are saying they don't have volumes,"" said one of the sources. Rosneft, IOC, HPCL and BPCL did not respond to Reuters's requests for comment. Russia is ramping up oil exports from its major eastern port of Kozmino by about a fifth to meet surging demand from Asian buyers and offset the impact of European Union sanctions. Trade sources said Rosneft is pushing barrels into the markets through trading firms such as Everest Energy, Coral Energy, Bellatrix and Sunrise. Bellatrix and Sunrise were not available for comment, while Coral and Everest did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment. According to the shipping data cited by two traders in the Urals market, all four trading firms acted as suppliers of crude oil purchased from Rosneft to India. China has also boosted its purchases from Russia. Rosneft has awarded 900,000 tonnes (6.66 million barrels) of ESPO Blend crude oil loading in June to Unipec, the trading arm of Asia's top refiner Sinopec Corp, according to four traders. Indian sources said Russian oil is no longer available at deep discounts and they get fewer offers for sale on a Delivered At Port (DAP) basis, an international commercial term in which the seller pays for insurance and freight and ownership is transferred to the buyer only after the cargo is discharged. ""Earlier the companies were offering good discounts but that is not available now. Offers have been reduced and discounts are not as good as before, as insurance and freight rates have gone up,"" another source said. The European Union, which along with Britain and the United States dominate the international marine market, last week announced an immediate ban on new insurance contracts for ships carrying Russian oil, and gave a six-month grace period for existing contracts. The lack of shipping insurance coverage has hit IOC's purchases of Russian oil under a contract it signed with Rosneft last year, sources said. The contract gives IOC an option to buy 2 million tonnes of oil from Rosneft on a free on board (FOB) basis, which requires the buyer to charter ships and pay for insurance to load the cargoes from Russia. India largely buy Russian Urals crude, but the most recent IOC deal includes an option of supplies of ESPO Blend from the Russian port of Kozmino and Sakhalin's Sokol grade as well, one of the sources said. Indian refiners are however continuing to lift some volumes from the spot markets, and HPCL and BPCL might get about 1 million-2 million barrels of Russian oil in July, the sources said.  "
Updated: 30 May 2022,Bounce Infinity to set up battery swapping infra across BPCL fuel stations,https://www.livemint.com/auto-news/bounce-infinity-to-set-up-battery-swapping-infra-across-bpcl-fuel-stations-11653900509065.html,"Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and Bounce Infinity have joined hands to fortify the Bounce Infinity’s extensive battery swapping infrastructure. Under this partnership, Bounce Infinity will set-up battery swapping stations across Bharat Petroleum fuel stations in a phased manner. The company aims to set up 3,000 stations across top 10 cities.  Consumers looking to swap their nearly drained batteries can search for the nearest swapping location on the Bounce App. The smart framework will cater not only to the company's retail business, but will also support the interoperable partners (2W’s, 3W’s & other OEM’s) for ease of mobility across geographies and form factors i.e two wheelers & three wheelers. Battery swapping as a solution would also support those 2W’s & 3W’s that have been converted to EV from ICE.

Updated: 19 May 2022,The curious case of Fino Bank exits,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/the-curious-case-of-fino-bank-exits-11652893487158.html,"BENGALURU : If you are in Srinagar in April, it’s easy to believe all is well with the world. The senior leadership of Fino Payments Bank, who had travelled to Kashmir for an off-site last month, had other reasons—besides the splendid views—for optimism. They had pulled off a successful sale of shares to the public last November, business was recovering from the blows of the pandemic and the road ahead appeared a smooth one. At the sprawling LaLit Grand Palace, once home to Jammu and Kashmir royalty, the top brass of the payments bank spent the day in meetings, briefing its board about the strategy for the current financial year. Six of the eight board members later spent the evening with chief executive officer Rishi Gupta and half-a-dozen senior executives, including chairman Mahendra Chouhan and independent director Punita Kumar Sinha, on the lawns of the hotel that overlooks the Dal Lake. Missing from this off-site session were the two nominee directors of institutional investors ICICI Group and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. The two firms together own about 40% of Fino Paytech Ltd, the holding company of Fino Payments Bank, according to the draft red herring prospectus filed by the latter in 2021 before it was listed. Fino Paytech owns 75% of Fino Payments Bank.                                            "
Updated: 02 May 2022,Ukraine war: Who is buying Russian crude oil and who has stopped,https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/ukraine-war-who-is-buying-russian-crude-oil-and-who-has-stopped-11651490568620.html,"Here is the response by countries regarding purchases of Russian oil since the war in Ukraine started on Feb. 24 and how companies have acted. Countries' responses Australia, Britain, Canada and the United States have imposed outright bans on Russian oil purchases but the 27 members of the European Union have not been able to agree on the embargo. The bloc is leaning toward a ban on imports of Russian oil by the end of the year as part of a sixth package of sanctions against Russia. Germany, the EU's largest economy, said it would be able to weather an EU embargo on Russian oil imports by the end of this year even though a stoppage could result in shortages. Hungary said it still opposed any European Union embargo on Russian oil and gas imports. Many refiners in Europe, however, have stopped buying Russian crude voluntarily, or promised to do so when their long-term contracts expire. Major global trading houses are also planning to reduce Russian crude and fuel purchases from May 15. As a result, Russian diesel exports from the Baltic port of Primorsk, a key supply source for Europe, were set to drop by more than 30% in May. China and India, which have refused to condemn Russia's actions, continue to buy Russian crude. Below are current and former buyers of Russian crude (in alphabetical order): Current buyers Bharat Petroleum Indian state-run refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd has bought 2 million barrels of Russian Urals for May loading from trader Trafigura, two people familiar with the purchase said. The company regularly buys Russian Urals for its 310,000 barrels per day (bpd) Kochi refinery in southern India. Hellenic Petroleum Greece's biggest oil refiner relies on Russian crude for about 15% of its intake. The company earlier this month secured additional supplies from Saudi Arabia. Hindustan Petroleum India's state refiner bought 2 million barrels of Russian Urals for May loading, according to trading sources last week. Indian Oil Corp India's top refiner has bought 6 million barrels of Urals since Feb. 24 and has a supply contract with Rosneft for up to 15 million barrels of Russian crude in 2022. However, the refiner, which also buys crude on behalf of its Chennai Petroleum subsidiary, has excluded several high-sulphur crude grades, including Urals, from its latest tender, according to trading sources. ISAB Italy's largest refinery, owned by Lukoil-controlled Swiss-based Litasco SA, has been forced to source nearly all of its crude oil from its Russian owner because international banks are no longer providing it with credit. The Italian government is considering temporary nationalisation of ISAB as one of its options if sanctions are imposed on Russian oil, two government sources told Reuters. Leuna The land-locked Leuna refinery in eastern Germany, majority-owned by France's TotalEnergies, is also fed Russian crude by the Druzhba pipeline. Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals The state-run Indian refiner has bought 1 million barrels of Russian Urals crude for May loading via a tender from a European trader, a rare purchase driven by the discount offered. Miro Russian crude continues to account for about 14% of the intake at Germany's largest refinery, Miro, which is 24% owned by Rosneft. MOL The Hungarian oil company, which operates three refineries in Hungary and Slovakia and Croatia, continues to buy Russian crude via the Druzhba pipeline, as well as refined products. The company said it would take two to four years and cost between $500 million and $700 million to replace Russian oil imports in case of a full European embargo. Nayara Energy The Indian private refiner, part-owned by Rosneft, has purchased Russian oil after a gap of a year, buying about 1.8 million barrels of Urals from Trafigura. Neftochim Burgas A Bulgarian refinery, owned by Russia's Lukoil, and with Russian crude accounting for about 60% of its intake, continues to refine Russian crude. PCK Schwedt Germany's PCK Schwedt refinery, 54% owned by Rosneft, receives crude oil via the Druzhba pipeline. Pertamina Indonesian state energy firm PT Pertamina is considering buying crude oil from Russia as it seeks oil for a newly revamped refinery. PKN Orlen Poland's largest refiner has stopped buying Russian crude on the spot market, switching to North Sea oil, but is still buying Urals under previously signed contracts which expire by the end of this year or later. The company, which operates refineries in Lithuania, Poland and the Czech Republic, saw its profit from refining surge in March thanks to the discount it pays for Russian oil. Sinopec China's state-run Sinopec, Asia's largest refiner, is continuing to purchase Russian crude under previously signed long-term contracts but is steering clear of new spot deals. Former buyers BP The British oil major, which is abandoning its stake in Rosneft, will not enter new deals with Russian entities for loading at Russian ports, unless ""essential for ensuring security of supplies"". ENEOS Japan's biggest refiner has stopped buying crude oil from Russia, while some cargoes signed under previous agreements will arrive in Japan until around April. The company plans to source alternative supplies from the Middle East. Eni The energy group, 30.3% owned by the Italian government, is suspending purchases of Russian oil. No Russian crude will be used at Germany's Bayernoil refinery, in which Eni and Rosneft have stakes. Equinor Norway's majority state-owned energy firm has stopped trading Russian oil as it winds down its operations in the country. Galp The Portuguese oil and gas company has suspended all new purchases of petroleum products from Russia or Russian companies. Glencore The global mining and trading firm, which holds a 0.57% stake in Rosneft, said it would continue to honour its obligations under previously signed contracts, but would ""not enter into any new trading business in respect of Russian origin commodities unless directed by the relevant government authorities"". Neste The Finnish refiner has not bought Russian crude oil on the spot market since the start of the war and is not planning to sign new deals when the existing long-term supply contract ends in July. From the start of April, the refiner has replaced about 85% of the Russian crude oil with other crudes. OMV Petrom Romania's top oil and gas firm, controlled by Austria's OMV has said it was preparing to wean itself off Russian crude imports, which account to about 30% of its Petrobrazi refinery's annual needs. Preem Sweden's largest refiner, owned by Saudi billionaire Mohammed Hussein al-Amoudi, has ""paused"" new orders of Russian crude, which accounted for about 7% of its purchases, replacing them with North Sea barrels. Repsol The Spanish company has stopped buying Russian crude oil in the spot market. Shell The world's largest petroleum trader has stopped buying Russian crude and on April 27 said it would no longer accept refined products with any Russian content, including blended fuels. Trafigura The Geneva-based global commodities trader plans to stop all purchases of crude oil from Rosneft by May 15 when tighter EU rules on Russian oil sales come into effect, and ""substantially"" reduce volume of refined products it buys from Rosneft. Total Energies The French oil companyhas said it would no longer enter into or renew the existing contracts to buy Russian crude oil and petroleum products, with the aim of halting all purchases by the end of 2022. The contracts primarily cover supplies for its Leuna refinery in eastern Germany, which gets Russian crude via the Druzhba pipeline, as well as Europe's gasoil supply. VARO Energy The Swiss refiner, which owns 51.4% in Germany's Bayernoil refinery, has said it does not plan to enter into new deals to buy Russian crude.   "
Updated: 28 Apr 2022,India asks state firms to consider buying Russian oil assets,https://www.livemint.com/news/world/india-asks-state-firms-to-consider-buying-russian-oil-assets-11651156477367.html,"India has asked state-run energy companies to evaluate the possibility of buying European oil major BP's stake in sanctions-hit Russian firm Rosneft, two people familiar with the matter said. BP has announced it is abandoning its 19.75% stake in Rosneft. The oil ministry last week conveyed its intent to ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), Indian Oil Corp., Bharat Petro Resources Ltd (BPRL), Hindustan Pertoleum's subsidiary Prize Petroleum Ltd, Oil India Ltd and GAIL (India) Ltd, the sources said. Indian companies and the oil ministry did not respond to Reuters emails seeking comment. While Western nations have imposed sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine, India has not explicitly condemned Moscow's actions there. The world's third biggest oil importer and consumer, India imports about 85% of its 5 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil needs. The call on Indian companies to explore buying the stake in Rosneft came after BP CEO Bernard Looney met Indian oil minister Hardeep Singh Puri in March. BP declined to comment. Oil ministry also asked OVL, the overseas investment arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp, to consider buying a 30% stake held by Exxon Mobile Corp, in the Sakhalin 1 project in Russia's Far East. Exxon is the operator of the project. OVL already holds a 20% stake in the project. Exxon said on March 1 it would exit about $4 billion in assets and discontinue all its Russia operations, including Sakhalin 1. OVL also holds 26% stake in Vankorneft, owner of the Venkor field in the West Siberian Basin. Separately, a consortium of Oil India, IOC, and BPRL, the exploration arm of state refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp , holds a 23.9% stake in Vankorneft and a 29.9% stake in Taas-Yuryakh in east Siberia. One of the sources said Indian companies hope to get stakes in Russian assets at discounted rates given the risk involved, dubbing the potential transactions ""distress sales"". A second source said Indian companies needed to study the impact of sanctions on potential investments and yet to start a process of due dilligence. ""The fear is that this investment could get stuck in Russia as sanctions might bar us from bringing equity oil and gas to India."" ""Our effort has been to see how we can stabilise economic transactions, economic engagements with Russia in the current context ... There are of course constraints, there are sanctions by some countries, and we will have to kind of work through that,"" India's foreign ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a news conference. Exxon said on Wednesday its Russian unit Exxon Neftegas Ltd has declared force majeure for its Sakhalin-1 operations due to sanctions on Russia that have made it increasingly difficult to ship crude to customers.

Updated: 23 Apr 2022,Centre  weighs  going  back to drawing board on BPCL sale,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/centre-weighs-going-back-to-drawing-board-on-bpcl-sale-11650649334170.html,"NEW DELHI : The government is weighing its options on the strategic disinvestment of Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, including whether it needs to return to the drawing board and restart the bidding process or revise certain conditions in the existing process. Rising oil prices and the increasing tilt towards green energy have thrown up fresh issues for bidders, posing challenges for the disinvestment process, an official aware of the development said. “There are several issues... bidders also appear to be facing issues in terms of securing investors; the oil prices are not helping the situation either... we will have to take a call on the next steps,"" the official said on condition of anonymity. The government had received multiple bids for BPCL in November 2020 from miner Vedanta Resources, and private equity firms Apollo Global and I Squared Capital’s arm Think Gas. However, Mint has learnt that Think Gas has dropped out, leaving only two companies in the bidding process. Vedanta Resources is planning to set up a $10 billion fund to bid for the government’s stake in BPCL and other assets, chairman Anil Agarwal said in January. Apollo Global declined to comment. Emails sent to Vedanta and I Squared Capital did not elicit a response as of press time. Bidders need to have a net worth of $10 billion, and public sector units with government ownership of 51% and more have been excluded as per the initial terms and conditions set by the government when it began the BPCL disinvestment process in early 2020. The government is yet to invite financial bids, even though it had initially planned to close the deal by March 2021. The covid pandemic also led to delays in finding suitors. A second official said that the value that the government will get from the transaction is a key factor since BPCL’s share price has fallen over the past year. In April 2021, the stock was trading in a range of ₹418 to ₹422, but in April 2022, it fell to the ₹374-390 range. On Friday, the shares fell 1.06% to ₹393.5 on BSE. The government, which holds a 52.98% stake in BPCL, plans to sell its entire holding and transfer management control as part of the strategic disinvestment process, making the deal a lucrative one as a private company will be able to reap benefits from the profitable asset. However, at the current share price, the market cap of the country’s second-largest oil refining and marketing company comes to ₹85,360 crore, lower than over ₹90,000 crore back in November 2020 when it had received the bids. The government would get about ₹45,000 crore from the transaction at current valuation. Mint had reported in January 2021 that the transaction could be valued at ₹90,000 crore. Proceeds from the sale will help the government achieve its ₹65,000 crore disinvestment target set for FY23. Queries sent to the finance ministry and BPCL remained unanswered till press time. The qualifying bidder will not only have a controlling stake in BPCL but will also get access to a 25.77% market share in India’s fuel retailing segment, along with 15.3% of India’s total refining capacity. BPCL operates four refineries in Mumbai, Kochi, Bina, and Numaligarh in Assam, with a combined capacity of 38.3 million tonnes per annum. As part of the privatization process, BPCL last year sold its 61.65% stake in Assam-based Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) for ₹9,875 crore to a consortium of Oil India Ltd (OIL) and Engineers India Ltd (EIL) (49%) and the remaining 13.65% to the Assam government in March."

Updated: 08 Mar 2022,Divestment deadline may be extended,https://www.livemint.com/science/news/divestment-deadline-may-be-extended-11646680872466.html,"NEW DELHI : The Russia-Ukraine conflict may force India to extend deadlines for planned strategic divestments in some major state-run companies with potential investors seeking more time to submit bids, said two government officials aware of the developments, potentially impacting the government’s aim to bridge the fiscal deficit and raise funds for social welfare projects. The conflict will also likely hit valuations of Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Shipping Corporation of India, BEML Ltd and Pawan Hans Ltd, among others, that are being lined up for stake sales amid an overall delay in the entire process, the officials said. They said initial signs of a slowdown have already begun to emerge, with deadlines of some of the divestments being extended. This is set to derail the government’s disinvestment plan not only for this fiscal through March but also for the next year as investors remain on edge following growing uncertainty due to the global geopolitical tensions and rising oil and other commodity prices. “Nearly all transactions are in slow mode... investors are taking time because of uncertainties caused by war,"" one of the officials said, seeking anonymity. The second official cited above said while the government was trying to continue engaging with potential investors and bidders, waning investor sentiment has thrown a major spanner in the works. The planned sale of Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC) shares by this fiscal end holds the key for the government to meet its reduced asset-sales target of ₹78,000 crore for FY22. The disinvestment proceeds were budgeted for ₹1.75 trillion. LIC’s public offering would follow the successful sale of Air India to Tata group. However, sweeping sanctions against Russia and the expulsion of several Russian banks from financial messaging platform SWIFT may dampen foreign institutions’ participation in LIC’s share sale, as reported by Mint on Monday. “We’ve been watching the situation since last month and expecting that there may be some improvement, but it’s only getting worse... some stability is needed, once that happens, markets will bounce back,"" the first official said, referring to the volatile stock markets that are reflective of investor sentiment. Queries emailed to a finance ministry spokesperson remained unanswered. For FY22, the government has received disinvestment proceeds of ₹12,423 crore as of 7 March from Air India, MOIL, NMDC, HUDCO, HCL and IPCL. This is far below the revised target of ₹78,000 crore. Economists said the government would have a bigger challenge at hand in FY23 as it would have to divest a much larger number of public sector shares, which may put further pressure on valuations of enterprises lined up for divestments. “The government will have to target sales worth ₹1.3 trillion next fiscal— ₹65,000 crore for LIC if it spills over to next fiscal and ₹65,000 crore target for FY23—which will be a major challenge, and it’s a big question whether the market will have the capacity to take on such a large number of PSU shares,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda. “Even if the Ukraine crisis is settled, it will be at least six months before the markets normalize,"" Sabnavis noted."

Updated: 09 Feb 2022,India headed for sharp fuel price hike after states assembly elections: Report,https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-headed-for-sharp-fuel-price-hike-after-states-assembly-elections-report-11644394691137.html,"Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India expects the nation’s biggest fuel retailers to sharply raise pump prices after local elections end next month, adding pressure on the government and the central bank to take steps to contain inflation. “Because of the state elections, they haven’t increased the retail prices,"" Debasish Mishra, partner at Deloitte, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Haslinda Amin and Rishaad Salamat. He expects companies to increase prices by 8-9 rupees (11-12 cents) a liter to make up for a shortfall in sale price by March 10 when the election process winds down. Despite a surge in international prices, Indian Oil Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp. and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. -- which together control more than 90% of the domestic market -- have frozen gasoline and diesel rates for over three months, coinciding with elections in five states. While state-run fuel retailers are technically free to align prices with global rates, they often freeze rates in the run-up to polls fearing public backlash over higher prices.  When the increase eventually happens, the government is likely to absorb some of it by cutting taxes and let the consumers bear the rest, Mishra said.  Increase in oil prices pose a problem for the government by impacting disposable incomes in a nation where private consumption accounts for some 60% of gross domestic product. For the central bank, higher oil prices mean faster inflation, which can test its resolve to keep borrowing costs lower for longer to support the economy’s durable recovery from the pandemic. Every $10 increase in oil price will hurt India’s economic growth by 0.3% to 0.35%, Mishra said.  “Beyond $100, it will really have a lot of challenges for the Indian macro economic scenario,"" Mishra said. “It certainly increases our current account deficit, it puts pressure on the retail inflation. It certainly hurts India."" This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text. Only the headline has been changed."
Updated: 09 Feb 2022,Oil gets another tailwind as refiners go all out in India,https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/oil-gets-another-tailwind-as-refiners-go-all-out-in-india-11644363982685.html,"Oil refiners in the world’s third-biggest crude importer are stepping up purchases as they strive to meet annual production goals, giving prices another tailwind as they march toward $100 a barrel. At least 18 of India’s 23 refineries operated at more than 100% of nameplate capacity last month, up from just eight in August, according to several refinery officials with knowledge of the matter. Average run rates across the plants were 101% in December, compared with 87% in August, they said. The state-run processors -- Indian Oil Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp. and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. -- are reaching out to term-contract suppliers including Saudi Arabia and Iraq for extra barrels or buying on the spot market, said the officials, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. The big three, along with Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd., which together account for 65% of India’s processing capacity, are playing catch up after lagging behind production targets in the first nine months of the fiscal year through March as the virus hurt fuel demand. Oil imports rose to the highest in a year in December and the momentum is continuing this year even as the omicron variant weighs on diesel and gasoline consumption. Indian Oil, the country’s biggest refiner, has been topping up its term volumes with spot purchases for March and April loadings. Hindustan Petroleum has completed a 40,000-barrel-a-day expansion of its Mumbai plant, meaning it needs to buy more crude, Chairman Mukesh Kumar Surana said.  Most refineries that operated above their nameplate capacities in November and December had been restricting activities for the previous few months.  Profits from making diesel, the most popular fuel in India that its refineries are geared to produce a lot of, have risen to the highest levels in two years in Asia and the U.S. That’s providing an added incentive for domestic processors to crank up their run rates. Exports from India have also become increasingly crucial for the region amid a reduction in shipments from China. The state-run refiners, which only export fuels intermittently, are keeping the overseas sales option open if local demand fails to pick up, the officials said.

This is a first of its kind initiative to support the country's commitment to achieve renewable energy targets and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Refineries use large quantities of hydrogen for de-sulfurization to make petrol, diesel and other chemicals. Currently, hydrogen is made at the refinery via. steam reforming of natural gas, but this results in high CO2 emission. Therefore, refiners are setting up large scale electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen from water and thereby decarbonize hydrogen production. Arun Kumar Singh, CMD BPCL said, ""We have been extensively leveraging technology in all our activities. Today, through collaboration with BARC, we intend to scale up Indigenous Alkaline Electrolyzer Technology and look forward to commercializing it for large use especially in Refineries.""

Updated: 08 Dec 2021,"CII proposes faster divestment of PSUs, proceeds for infra building",https://www.livemint.com/industry/infrastructure/cii-proposes-faster-divestment-of-psus-proceeds-for-infra-building-11638959723637.html,"NEW DELHI : Industry lobby group CII has sought a faster divestment process of identified public sector units, including LIC of India, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd, and Shipping Corporation of India, such that proceeds from their sales can be channelled towards building rural and urban infrastructure. In its pre-Budget memorandum to the government, the industry body has suggested putting in place a conducive regulatory framework, transparent bidding process, flexible contract management and a credible dispute settlement procedure, in order to attract private investment in the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP). The government expects investments of ₹6 lakh crore in the ambitious plan, which has central government assets from multiple sectors up for private investors. For FY22, the government has set a ₹1.75 lakh crore target from divestments. “Provide tax incentives for investment in Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) and bring them under the Insolvency and Bankrupcy code (IBC) as suggested by NITI Aayog,"" the industry body has said in a slew of suggestions for the government. Among suggestions to increase investments, the lobby group said that more labour-intensive industries should be included under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which can aid job creation if incentives are linked to job creation on the firm’s payroll and production, instead of solely meeting production targets. It also suggested that the interest subvention scheme available on low- cost housing should be extended to cover total housing cost of up to ₹35 lakh instead of ₹25 lakhs at present. Further, allocation under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) should be increased from ₹27,500 crore allocated in the Union Budget 2021-22. For speedy dispute settlement in infrastructure projects, contracts up to a certain threshold value could have dispute resolution through binding conciliation and /or arbitration process, it said, adding that more Commercial Dispute Resolution Courts specialising in infrastructure sector-related disputes should be set up. “Release all dues, whether outstanding payments or tax refunds to industry immediately. Further, release all outstanding payments to the state governments and other service providers,"" the body said. The body further suggested that fiscal support should be provided to facilitate the creation of a ‘pandemic pool’ which would help mitigate the risk of financial losses of insurance companies due to future pandemics. On promoting exports, the body suggested a sea-freight subsidy for a limited period of 6-7 months to exporters impacted by the high cost of containers. Shortage of containers and high costs have lead to higher freight charges and in turn escalated costs for industry and consumers. “Allow SEZs/EoUs to avail the RoDTEP benefit for exports made from SEZ/EoU units. Provide infrastructure status to SEZs for accessing priority funding from banks at cost effective rates,"" it said in two related suggestions related to trade. It also sought for expedite the clearance of the stuck Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS) claims of previous years on a priority basis. At present over ₹40,000 crore worth of tax refunds under the MEIS are yet to be received as per Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO). Direct Tax proposals On direct tax, the industry body has suggested extending concessional long term capital gains tax rate of 10% to resident investors in start-ups registered with the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade. It argued that while foreign investment into India is promoted, local investments in private companies are disincentivised, particularly, in start ups which are a high risk investment which generates employment and leads to innovation. It added that monetary limit for deduction for new employees under Section 80JJAA, should be increased to ₹1 lakh instead of ₹25,000 now. Section 80JJAA allows deduction in respect of 30% of the salary of an additional employee hired during the year for a total period of three years. For this purpose, an additional employee is defined as one whose salary emoluments do not exceed Rs. 25,000 per month. The increased limit will provide incentive for hiring technically qualified skilled employees who provide more value addition to the business, CII said. It further suggested that income from mutual funds and business trusts may be put at par with dividend income by restricting maximum surcharge to 15%. The industry body urged the government to re-think the denial of depreciation on goodwill acquired in taxable transaction. “The seller is liable to pay capital gains tax on such transaction. The value of goodwill in such transaction indicates consideration paid by the acquirer to secure synergy, larger market share, better cashflow, forward or backward integration, competitive strength and higher efficiency in existing business, which leads to better profitability and higher tax,"" it said. It added that the claim of depreciation on goodwill should not be denied for acquisition of business in non-tax neutral business reorganization like slump sale, exchange or itemized sale. Indirect tax proposals CII proposed that the government should consider creating a graded roadmap, strategized to shift duty slabs to a competitive level over three years, with exception to few products presently in the higher slabs, accompanied by policy actions to boost domestic manufacturing. Duty on imports of final products to be in standard slab, intermediates in the lower slab and inputs or raw materials to be at the lowest or nil slab. “A phased manufacturing program together with production linked incentives (PLI) are good example, so that domestic manufacturers have time to adjust,"" the body said in its representation. It added that review of final and intermediate products should be undertaken in consultation with the stakeholders to ensure that inputs which are not being manufactured in India can be imported at lower duty to increase export competitiveness of final products manufactured in India. Further, RoDTEP rates should be reviewed and enhanced in commensurate with the actual embedded taxes and duties, and all export products should be covered under the scheme. It suggested that export incentive may be transferred directly to the bank account of the exporters like duty drawback, instead of routing through issuance and transfer of credit scripts. Further, provisions of customs law should be further simplified and the desired clarifications be issued for ease of compliance."

The stock listed at ₹544.35 apiece, a 5.65% discount over issue price of ₹577 per share. The ₹1200.29 crore initial public offering (IPO) was subscribed 2.03 times. The issue comprised a fresh Issue by the payments bank and an offer for sale by existing shareholders. Net proceeds from the fresh issue will be used to augment the bank’s tier -1 capital base to meet future capital requirements. Ahead of the issue, Vikas Jain, analyst, Reliance Securities, had said the IPO was valued at 31.9 times FY21 book value, which looks to be stretched. He believes current valuations do not leave much on the table for investors in the medium-term perspective. ""The bank generates over 95% of its income through fees and commissions, and future growth is primarily dependent on incremental wallet share digital payment opportunity in the country. Given, digital payments are expected to cross ₹3,500 trillion in FY25, recording a sharp 25-27% CAGR over FY21-FY25E, the bank is is poised to see healthy business opportunity in subsequent years in the backdrop of strong digital platform and resources built in the last couple of years,"" said Jain. The bank turned profitable in FY21, while its common equity tier- I (CET-1) ratio has been deteriorating for the last two years. CET-1 was at 56% as of FY21. Return on equity (RoE) and return on asset (RoA) stood at 13.3% and 2% respectively, as of FY21. According to Jyoti Roy, analyst, Angel One, at the higher end of the price band the stock would be trading at price to earnings (PE) of 220 times FY2021 fully diluted earnings per share (EPS) of ₹2.6 which is expensive. “Despite strong growth prospects, we believe that valuations do not justify the premium,"" she added. As there are no listed payment banks, analysts at Nirmal Bang have taken from cues from the merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions in the unlisted space. “We observe that during September 2021, Kotak Bank sold its 8.6% stake in Airtel Payments Bank to Bharti Enterprises for ₹300 crore. This transaction values the payment bank at ₹3,501 crore or FY21 P/S of 5.6 times. Fino is being valued at a 10% premium to this deal at FY21 P/S of 6.1 times. Having demonstrated profitability during FY21 and scope for further improvement in RoE via operating leverage, we believe Fino is reasonably valued,"" Nirmal Bang said. Fino Payments Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fino Paytech Ltd. Principle shareholders include marquee investors such as ICICI Bank Ltd, Intel Capital Corp., International Finance Corp., HAV3 Holdings (Mauritius) Ltd, Blackstone GPV Capital Partners (Mauritius) VI-B FDI Ltd, and Bharat Petroleum Corp.

Updated: 12 Sep 2021,Oil India’s efforts to pare debt help boost investor sentiment,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/oil-india-s-efforts-to-pare-debt-help-boost-investor-sentiment-11631462090472.html,"Rising crude oil prices and the expectations of a hike in domestic gas prices have benefited Oil India Ltd (OIL), and investors seem to have taken note of it. Shares of the company scaled 52-week highs on Thursday, having risen 76% year-to-date. Another boost for sentiment is the company’s improving outlook on liquidity and debt. Earlier this month, the company sold 4.9% stake in Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) to the government of Assam. This takes the total stake sale by the company to 8%. The ₹780.42 crore from the sale of the NRL stake will help the company repay short-term debt. This is a credit positive event, global rating agency Moody’s Investors Service Ltd pointed out. “This repayment will improve OIL’s liquidity and financial flexibility,"" the agency said in its release. The stake sale in NRL is part of a scheme wherein Oil India had acquired shareholding in the first place in March this year from Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd last year as part of the latter’s privatization process. The additional 10.5% in NRL was purchased on behalf of the Assam government with an understanding that the state would buy it back.  This buyback is crucial as the proceeds would help OIL retire debt it has piled on. As of March, the company’s debt was ₹19,720 crore, of which ₹4,300 crore matures this year. The Numaligarh refinery has helped the company expand its scope from being an oil producer to becoming an integrated oil and gas company. NRL’s June quarter overall gross refining margin (GRM) was boosted by an excise duty benefit of $30 a barrel, compared with $5.2 a barrel core GRM, analysts at Nomura Research pointed out in their post Q1 results note. With the NRL acquisition, OIL’s earnings are well-hedged to withstand crude fluctuation, according to analysts. As such, higher crude realizations were a factor behind the robust earnings in June quarter. Crude realizations were up 12.5% sequentially, helping the spike in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. That said, investors need to keep a watch on the speed with which the company brings down its debt. The NRL stake sale is just one step towards this and further debt reduction would depend on internal accruals and the completion of the transfer of the remaining 2% of NRL stake to the Assam government."

It restricts supply of LPG produced by firms such as ONGC and GAIL to private firms. Private LPG retailers, called parallel marketeers, have to use imported gas for supplying to customers. The 2000 Control Order was issued as the nation is short in LPG production. Once BPCL is privatised, the 2000 order will bar ONGC and GAIL from selling LPG to BPCL, the officials said. ""Post divestment of the government's stake in BPCL, it shall cease to be a government oil company in terms of clause 2(g) of LPG Control Order of 2000,"" an official said. With no access to indigenously produced LPG, BPCL won't be able to serve its customers and it would not be possible to shift the customers to IOC and HPCL as LPG cylinder equipment at customer end will need to be changed. Also, IOC and HPCL may not have the required infrastructure to cater to such a large customer base, the officials said. As a way out, it is being considered to continue to treat BPCL as a government company for the purpose of the 2000 Control Order for three years, the officials said adding that a legal opinion has been sought to ascertain if such a move is tenable under the law. The other alternative is to amend the LPG Control Order itself to allow private firms to access indigenously produced LPG. This would open up LPG retailing to other private firms. Officials said law ministry opinion has been sought to determine if the term government oil company in the LPG Control Order necessary requires the company to be a government company and if BPCL post privatisation can be notified as a government oil company. To interpret the term 'government company', the opinion of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) as well as the Ministry of Consumer Affairs (MoCA) has been sought, they said. MCA because it is the administrative ministry for purposes of administration of the Companies Act, 2013 and MoCA because it is the administrative ministry/department for the purposes of administration of Essential Commodities Act, 1955, under which the LPG Control Order of 2000 was issued. Officials said the new owner of BPCL will after three years of takeover get a right to decide on retaining the business of selling subsidised LPG. The firm's cooking gas LPG customers will be transferred to IOC and HPCL in case the new owner does not want to continue with such a business, the officials added. The government gives 12 cooking gas (LPG) cylinders of 14.2-kg each to households in a year at a subsidised rate. There is no subsidy being paid in most parts of the country but a subsidy will be directly paid into the bank accounts of the users in case prices rise steeply. The government is selling its entire 53 per cent stake along with management control in BPCL. The new owner will get 15.33 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and 22 per cent of the fuel marketing share. It also owns 18,652 petrol pumps, 6,166 LPG distributor agencies and 61 out of 260 aviation fuel stations in the country.

Ltd, a disinvestment candidate for the Centre, excited the stock market. But investors who are enthused by high dividends should factor in a host of metrics. Mint brings you the highs and lows. How do you know if the dividend is high? Investors usually compare the dividend to the stock price. The dividend per share divided by the price per share gives you the dividend yield of a company. The dividend yield gives you a rough idea of the income stream you will get by investing in the stock (if the dividend is maintained in future years) and investors often compare it to other income streams such as rent or interest. Note that dividends are declared at the discretion of the firm and there is no contractual obligation behind them like rent or interest.

Updated: 28 May 2021,Govt to soon clarify on allowing 100% FDI in BPCL privatization,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/dpiit-to-clarify-that-100-fdi-is-allowed-for-bpcl-privatisation-11622203355549.html,"The ministry of commerce and industry will soon clarify that 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) will be applicable in the privatization of Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), as the government is exiting the company. The move aims to remove any possibility of confusion, as FDI is now permitted only up to 49% in public sector petroleum refiners. “100% FDI is already permissible in private sector refining. As BPCL is getting privatized by the government, the same should apply to it as well. DPIIT (department for promotion of industry and internal trade) will soon clarify this,"" a government official said on the condition of anonymity. The current policy permits up to 49% FDI through the automatic route in petroleum refining PSUs, without any disinvestment or dilution of domestic equity in the existing PSUs. However, the policy permits 100% FDI through the automatic route in petroleum refining in the private sector. “As this is not a policy change and only a clarification, the government can get away with this, though the BPCL privatization process is already on and the deadline for fresh bids is over,"" an FDI policy expert with a law firm said on the condition of anonymity. The Centre has approved the sale of its entire 52.98% shareholding in BPCL along with the transfer of management control to a strategic buyer. Preliminary information memorandum/expression of interest (PIM/EoI) for strategic disinvestment of BPCL was issued on 7 March 2020. The last date for submission of EoI was extended a few times up to 6 November 2020. The transaction has now moved to the second stage with the receipt of multiple EoIs. Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan in December last year said the Centre has received three preliminary bids for the acquisition of controlling stake in BPCL. Vedanta Group and two American funds, Apollo Global and I Squared Capital, have reportedly submitted EoIs. The decision to privatize the profitable oil marketer is based on the reasoning that the presence of a private sector player would break the state-controlled oligopoly and benefit consumers, minister of state for finance and corporate affairs Anurag Singh Thakur said in the Lok Sabha in a written reply to a question in March. Strategic disinvestment of PSUs is being guided by the basic economic principle that the government should exit sectors where competitive markets have come of age and the economic potential of such entities may be better discovered in the hands of a strategic investor because of various factors such as infusion of capital, technological upgrade and efficient management practices and would thus add to the overall economic growth of the country, Thakur said. The government’s ambitious disinvestment schedule for FY22 may get delayed because of the second wave of the covid-19 pandemic that is ravaging the country, disinvestment secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said at the Mint India Investment Summit 2021 last month. Pandey, however, exuded confidence that the ₹1.75 trillion target is still achievable. With revenues expected to shrink for the second consecutive year in FY22, achieving the disinvestment target will be crucial for the finance ministry. A query sent to the commerce and industry ministry remained unanswered till the time of going to press."
Updated: 17 May 2021,India’s oil demand shrinks further as Covid crisis persists,https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/indias-oil-demand-shrinks-further-as-covid-crisis-persists-11621208980940.html,"India’s oil demand worsened in the first half of May as large parts of the nation remained under local lockdowns to battle the world’s worst outbreak of Covid-19. Sales of road transport fuels during May 1-15 dropped by a fifth from the previous month and about 28% from the same period in 2019, according to people familiar with preliminary data from the country’s three biggest retailers. Average daily sales of gasoline -- used in cars and motorcycles -- fell to about 53,300 tons, the lowest in a year. Sale of diesel -- the country’s most-used fuel and a proxy for economic health -- dropped to a seven-month low of 147,300 tons a day during May 1-15. The plunge in consumption at the world’s third-biggest crude consumer will weigh on sentiment on oil prices and damp expectations for a strong global demand rebound in the summer. The International Energy Agency has lowered its 2021 global oil demand forecast from the impact of the raging virus outbreak in India, while OPEC and its allies are already taking a cautious view. India has become the current global epicenter of the pandemic and the virus is spreading rapidly from urban centers to rural areas, where about 70% of country’s 1.3 billion population live. More than 300,000 daily infections are reported since April 22, straining the health system and overwhelming crematoriums and hospitals, and forcing bulk of Indian states to stay in lockdown. The strict stay-at-home orders are constraining the movement of people, lowering fuel sales and curbing crude processing by refineries to manage its rapidly-growing stockpiles. Spokespeople for Indian Oil Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp., and Hindustan Petroleum Corp., declined to comment. The three retailers account for more than 90% of the nation’s fuel sales.

The data room has been open since the last week of April and some bidders have held meetings with BPCL management, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified as the talks are private. The BPCL privatization, which could be the country’s biggest, is crucial for India. The government needs to raise capital to make up the fall in tax revenues as the pandemic hit the economy. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said last month the plan to raise about $23 billion from selling stakes in state-run companies, including BPCL, is still on course despite the fresh wave of coronavirus infections. The government’s 53% stake in BPCL is valued at about 496 billion rupees ($6.7 billion), based on the latest trading price on Friday. Shares in the refiner fell about 0.6% as of 2:02 p.m. in Mumbai. The recent Covid-19 outbreak could still slow down the sale process, one of the people said. A representative for the finance ministry declined to comment, while a representative for BPCL didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

This is the second hike in transportation fuel prices since 23 February. As a result, petrol and diesel prices in Delhi were increased by 19 paise per litre and 21 paise per litre respectively. Petrol and diesel were retailing at Rs90.74 per litre and Rs81.12 per litre respectively on Wednesday in Delhi at state run Indian Oil Corporation Ltd’ outlets. The cost of the Indian basket of crude, which comprises Oman, Dubai and Brent crude, was at $66.63 a barrel on 4 May. Following the covid outbreak, crude prices for Indian basket of crude had plunged to $19.90 in April last year before recovering to $63.40 a barrel in April, data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell showed. Interestingly, the diesel and petrol retail prices in India have remained subdued during the assembly elections in West Bengal, Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry, with three government-run oil marketing companies—Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL)—refraining from raising prices. The state-run OMCs and the government have maintained that there is no correlation between elections and transportation fuel price freeze. The government’ stand has been that it has got no role in pricing since India’s three government-run OMCs introduced dynamic fuel pricing, joining countries such as the US and Australia, where fuel prices change daily depending on global oil price fluctuations."

The deadly second wave topped 400,000 new daily cases for the first time on Saturday. Authorities reported 401,993 new cases in the previous 24 hours, the highest daily count globally, after 10 consecutive days over 300,000. Deaths from COVID-19 jumped by 3,523, taking the total toll in India to 211,853. ""Overall fuel demand is down by about 7% from pre-covid level of April 2019,"" said A.K. Singh, head of marketing at refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp. ""We were near pre-covid level in March but new restrictions and covid wave-2 has temporarily reduced demand equivalent to about 10% of March demand for both personal mobility and industrial goods movement,"" Singh told Reuters. He said the local fuel consumption will 'start to look up' in June, by when second wave of coronavirus is expected to weaken. Analysts are expecting India's demand for transportation fuels to witness a sharper slump in May due to more impending restrictions. Declining fuel sales will reduce crude intake by refiners. The country's top refiner Indian Oil Corp is operating refineries at an average 95% capacity. State companies - IOC, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and BPCL - own about 90% of India's retail fuel outlets. State retailers' fuel sales in April declined from their sales in March and April 2019 levels, while posting a sharp rise from the year ago month when there was a nation-wide lockdown."
Updated: 23 Apr 2021,More companies chip in to help fill gaps in supply of oxygen,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/more-companies-chip-in-to-help-fill-gaps-in-supply-of-oxygen-11619201315388.html,"Companies ranging from steelmakers to refiners to logistics firms are extending a helping hand by retooling their processes to produce oxygen for the sick or transporting medical equipment as supplies at hospitals dwindle. While Jindal Steel and Power and Vedanta group have volunteered to supply oxygen from their plants, Allcargo Logistics has offered to ship 500 oxygen concentrators from Singapore for the Maharashtra government. The concentrators help produce oxygen from air. As the coronavirus pandemic rages, India’s healthcare system is near breaking point, with thousands of critically sick people failing to secure treatment and hospitals turning away patients, unable to provide critical oxygen supplies. As of Friday, nearly a dozen firms, including Reliance Industries Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and JSW Steel Ltd, are supplying oxygen to hospitals. Industries use oxygen for combustion, oxidation, cutting and chemical reactions. To make industrial oxygen suitable for administering to humans, firms need to free it from impurities. Manufacturers prepare liquid oxygen with 99.5% purity, which is then stored in large tankers and transported to distributors in cryogenic tankers at a specified temperature. It’s then regasified and filled into cylinders by distributors. These cylinders are then dispatched to hospitals. “It is not possible to set up new oxygen manufacturing plants or expand existing ones at short notice. That has also aggravated the demand-supply issue,"" said a Mumbai-based doctor, adding that with various firms pitching in, oxygen supply is being managed. In a tweet on Friday, the German embassy in India said Linde and Tata group have secured 24 oxygen transport tanks that will be airlifted to India in order to increase transport capacity from production sites to pandemic hotspots. According to the Steel Authority of India (Sail), the company has so far supplied 35,000 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen of 99.7% purity from its plants at Bokaro (Jharkhand), Bhilai (Chhattisgarh), Rourkela (Odisha), Durgapur and Burnpur in West Bengal. “We have more than 500 tonnes of liquid oxygen readily available at Angul. We can provide 100 tonnes/day to any government that needs it,"" Naveen Jindal, chairman of Jindal Steel and Power Ltd, said in a tweet."
Updated: 03 Apr 2021,Oil marketing companies may find it tough to shift to non-Opec crude,https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/oil-marketing-companies-may-find-it-tough-to-shift-to-non-opec-crude-11617384484296.html,"State-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) may find it hard to comply with the government’s recent order to cut crude imports from West Asia, especially Saudi Arabia, three senior OMC executives said. This has implications for costs and supplies, they said. Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), the world’s largest bloc of crude exporting countries. State-owned refiners are likely to face a challenge in attempts to find a reliable crude oil supplier, according to the three persons, all of whom requested anonymity. They also spoke about the increased costs involved in importing non-Opec crude because of additional freight charges. “We have been building our refineries substantially on Middle Eastern crude not only because of the availability of a variety of crude cocktails but also because we are ensured a continuous and voluminous supply, something other countries promise often but fail to deliver,"" said one of the three people cited above. Union minister for oil, petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan recently urged refiners to speed up diversification of crude resources and reduce dependence on West Asia. Indian consumers have been hit hard by rising oil prices, but the government’s repeated entreaties for Opec and its allies to ease supply curbs have fallen on deaf ears. The OMCs, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), have been asked to scout for other regions to source crude and potentially cut imports from Opec by at least a quarter. Last month, HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd, a joint venture between HPCL and Mittal Energy Ltd, bought cargo from Guyana for the first time as part of the shift. India is the world’s third-largest oil importer after the US and China, and Opec makes up about 83% of the country’s oil imports. Diversification may be a tall order with around 79.4% of the world’s proven oil reserves located in Opec+ countries, according to experts. “Every time there is a crude oil pricing issue, OMCs are directed to look for alternative geographies to import crude from. We try. But given the other dynamics of cost, supply, volume and freight charges, we are back to square one in a few months,"" said another of the officials mentioned above. After West Asia, the next biggest suppliers for India are Russia and the US. However, they have their own challenges and commitments to other countries. “The kind of crude volumes and continuous supply our refineries need, only Middle Eastern crude can ensure. That is one of the reasons we are so heavily dependent on them,"" the second person said. This also allows refineries to change their product slate (the ability of a refinery to vary their production of output) depending on demand and the properties of the crude being refined. “If you look at the price of crude, it is the same for all countries. Opec does not sell it to India at a special price. The tax that Indian consumers pay on fuel is the primary reason behind the price hike. The government needs to look at that,"" said an analyst. The excise duty on petrol from April 2014 till date has gone up by ₹23.42 per litre or by 247%, the analyst said. For diesel, it has risen by ₹27.3 per litre, or 607%. VAT has also gone up by ₹9.14 per litre (up 77%) on petrol and ₹5.33 per litre on diesel (up 80.6%)."

It holds a 63.17% stake in Bhel, which accounts for 53% of India’s installed power generation capacity in the conventional space. While Andrew Yule is present in diverse businesses such as tea, electrical, engineering, lubricant and printing, Mecon is present in the metals and mining space. The divestment plans come against the backdrop of the Modi administration’s ₹1.75 trillion disinvestment playbook for the next fiscal gaining traction.

Another week later, the mining and metals major was placing full-page ads in papers that, while promoting itself, alluded to themes dear to this government—nation building, economic self-sufficiency and value creation. The association between Anil Agarwal and disinvestment runs long. In the early part of this century, Agarwal did with Bharat Aluminium Company (Balco) and Hindustan Zinc what he would like to do an encore of now: buy a government asset, with all its complexities, and create value for all stakeholders. In oil major Bharat Petroleum (BPCL), Vedanta is among the three preliminary bidders. Going by this government’s words, BPCL is the start of a long process that will alter the philosophy and landscape of government companies. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi outlined the government’s thinking. “The government has no business to remain in business,"" he said. Under an umbrella entity called the National Asset Monetisation Pipeline, the government is looking to sell about 100 “underutilized and unutilized assets"" and raise ₹2.5 trillion.

The divestment-bound national carrier owes about ₹2,000 crore to Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC), and a total of about ₹1,000 crore to Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL), said one of the two people cited above and who is also a senior official with a state-run oil marketing company (OMC). “We have however, been supplying fuel non-stop to the national carrier even during the pandemic,"" the official said, adding that the OMCs have written to Air India to clear the dues amid rising global crude prices that has increased the cost of operations at state-run refiners. Air India buys jet fuel worth ₹5-6 crore daily from the OMCs. The airline was earlier given a 90-day credit period but the prolonged delay in clearing the dues has led OMCs to put the carrier on a cash-and-carry basis for fuel supplies. The OMCs have in the past as well, temporarily halted fuel supplies to Air India due to mounting dues, only to resume later after the airline partially cleared its bills. “There’s a working capital crunch at the airline due to which pending dues towards OMCs are delayed,"" said an official with Air India. “However, these dues are eventually paid back. Also, since both Air India and OMCs are owned by the government, such situations are quickly resolved,"" the official said. A spokesperson for Air India said the airline does not comment on its internal matters. Spokespersons of IOCL, BPCL and HPCL also declined to comment. Air India is expected to post a cash loss of around ₹6,000 crore this fiscal through March, up from ₹3,600 crore last year. Cash loss means an entity is not generating positive cash flow from its operations. Overall, the airline is likely to incur a net loss of ₹9,500-10,000 crore this fiscal, up from a ₹8,000 crore loss recorded in the previous year, Mint had reported on 8 February, citing senior airline officials. To make up for the cash loss, Air India has raised about ₹5,500 crore so far this fiscal year, and is likely to raise another ₹500 crore by the end of March. The government aims to complete the privatization of Air India in FY22. So far, Tata group and an employee consortium headed by a board member of the national carrier are among interested parties to submit expressions of interest. "
Updated: 18 Feb 2021,City gas supply companies spar with OMCs over hike in charges,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/city-gas-supply-companies-spar-with-omcs-over-hike-in-charges-11613669238420.html,"Mumbai: City gas distribution firms have sought the Centre’s intervention following a demand by state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) for a higher commission on retail sales of compressed natural gas (CNG). The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board had last November barred OMCs, including Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, from opening CNG dispensing units at their retail fuel outlets. These OMCs have a commission-based arrangement with city gas licensees on CNG sales through their retail outlets. City gas distribution companies, including Mahanagar Gas Ltd, Indraprastha Gas Ltd and Gujarat Gas, have urged the Union government to negotiate with the OMCs after they demanded a 90-100% hike in commissions from the existing ₹4.5 per kg to ₹7-8 per kg. “OMCs have raised the demand for a steep hike in trade discount for filling CNG from their retail outlets. We have sought the intervention of the ministry of petroleum and natural gas in this matter and are hopeful of a resolution soon,"" an official at a city gas distribution company said, requesting anonymity. Motilal Oswal said any increase in commission or other costs will be a challenge for city gas distributors. The OMCs have, meanwhile, been hit by rising rentals in metros where the bulk of their retail outlets are based. Officials at OMCs said the ban on retailing CNG by the regulator was a setback as they were planning to scale up the segment to grow revenue. Besides, the sale of petrol and diesel gets affected with buses and three-wheelers—the bulk of customers—opting for CNG, said a senior OMC official, also seeking anonymity. “At a time when rentals are going up and fuel sales are going down, we will have to make up for the gap in revenue from somewhere. So, asking for an increased commission is not out of place,"" he added. Queries emailed to the spokespersons of OMCs and city gas distributors on Tuesday did not elicit any response till press time. Indian Oil is currently the market leader with 28,237 fuel stations, followed by Hindustan Petroleum at 15,855 and Bharat Petroleum with 15,289. “After the covid outbreak, operating expenditure, manpower and fixed costs for city gas distribution companies have gone up. If OMCs impose a double increase in commission charges, it will impact our margins,"" said the city gas company official cited above. To meet rising costs, Mahanagar Gas had on 9 February raised the CNG price by ₹1.50 a kg and domestic piped natural gas price by 95 paise per unit in Mumbai. According to the firm, while minimum wages have gone up, operating expenditure on a per-unit basis sold increased from ₹4.70-4.90 (pre-covid) to ₹5.50- 5.70. The OMCs said that according to a recent study by the companies, they have taken into account factors such as marketing efforts by them and the (fuel) substitution impact that their fuel outlets would have when CNG is retailed through them. OMCs also argue that by using their retail outlets, the city gas companies get not only readymade infrastructure but also customers. “All this involves costs,"" said the OMC official cited above. India has about 40 city gas distribution firms, which together operate 1,500 CNG stations. However, there are nearly 60,000 fuel stations dispensing petrol and diesel. The share of gas in India’s energy mix is expected to rise to 15% by 2030, with the government’s push for creating a gas infrastructure. Companies are thus seeing a large opportunity in the sector."

Targeting to raise ₹1.75 lakh crore from the asset sale to finance projects aimed at reviving the pandemic battered economy, the government is also looking to sell Shipping Corp of India (SCI), IDBI Bank Ltd and two other public sector lenders in the fiscal year beginning April 1. In an interview with PTI, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said the government has introduced the legislative amendments required for disinvestment of a stake in Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and IDBI Bank through the Finance Bill, 2021 presented along with the Budget on Monday. The Modi government is targeting record capital expenditure next fiscal to pull the economy out of the trough. Additional resources required for that are to be raised through divestment and monetisation. It has already received the preliminary expression of interest for the sale of stake in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Air India while the same for SCI is due on February 13. ""LIC Amendment Act and Amendment to IDBI Bank (Transfer of Undertaking and Repeal) Act has been made part of the Finance Bill. There will be no separate bill. LIC IPO would come post-October,"" Pandey said. DIPAM, which manages government's equity in state-owned companies, has already selected actuarial firm Milliman Advisors for ascertaining the embedded value of LIC, ahead of the initial public offer. While Deloitte and SBI Caps have been appointed as pre-IPO transaction advisors. With regard to IDBI Bank's strategic sale, Pandey said IDBI was a development finance institution initially. ""When IDBI Bank was formed in 2002 there was IDBI Repeal Act under which banking operations were provided and licence was also given. So the licence has to continue in case it is disinvested. So for that to happen, in consultation with the RBI, we have worked out an amendment to the Act which is part of the Finance Act,"" Pandey added. The Budget for 2021-22 has set a disinvestment target of ₹1.75 lakh crore, higher than ₹32,000 crore estimated to be garnered in the current fiscal. Of the ₹1.75 lakh crore, ₹1 lakh crore is to come from selling government stake in public sector banks and financial institutions and ₹75,000 crore would come as CPSE disinvestment receipts. In her Budget speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said strategic disinvestment of BPCL, Air India, Shipping Corporation of India, Container Corporation of India, IDBI Bank, BEML, Pawan Hans, Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd, among others, and IPO of LIC would be completed in 2021-22. The process of privatisation of Air India, BPCL, Pawan Hans, BEML, Shipping Corp (SCI), Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd, and Ferro Scrap Nigam Ltd (FSNL) is ongoing. Asked about the status on BPCL and Air India disinvestment, Pandey said, ""We are on course. The process is rolled on."" The three stages of the strategic disinvestment process are Expression of Interest (EoI), due diligence and Share Purchase Agreement (SPA), Request for Proposal (RFP) and then closing of the transaction. ""We are in the due diligence stage now. Within the first half (by September 2021) of next fiscal we expect the closure of BPCL, Air India and Shipping Corp transactions,"" the secretary added.

That has impacted the valuation of BPCL and raises concerns of potential bidders as costlier petrol and diesel would help grow competitive fuels like direct LNG use on trucks, electric vehicles, CNG sales at the expense of petrol and diesel demand growth,"" he added. This share sale is essential for meeting the government’s record ₹2.1 trillion divestment target that the finance ministry announced in the budget for 2020-21.

Since it is a listed company, the winner has to make an open offer, which will also take time. Regulatory requirements may delay the process even after receiving the financial bids. Everything is a well laid-out process, so nothing can be rushed through,"" a finance ministry official said on condition of anonymity. With little more than three months left for this fiscal year to end, it may be a tall task for the government to complete the stake sale that is crucial for it to meet the massive disinvestment target of ₹2.1 trillion set for the year to 31 March. The finance ministry missed the disinvestment target of ₹65,000 crore for the year ended 31 March by ₹14,701 crore, and it is likely to miss the target again due to the pandemic-induced economic downturn. So far this year, the government has garnered ₹12,225 crore through minority stake sales and an initial public offering of Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd. In the case of BPCL, transaction adviser Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India has completed the technical evaluation of the three bids received for the sale of the government’s 52.98% stake, which is expected to fetch around ₹45,000 crore. The transaction adviser has communicated to the bidders whether they have qualified for the second stage of the sale process. In the second stage, a business transfer agreement will be signed with the qualified bidders and they will be allowed to visit BPCL sites, and inspect its books after which they can make the financial bids. After four extensions in the wake of the pandemic, the deadline for submitting expressions of interest (EoIs) for BPCL ended on 16 November. Only private companies with a net worth of more than $10 billion were eligible. Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan earlier this month said the privatization of state-owned BPCL received three preliminary bids. Vedanta Group and two US funds had reportedly submitted their EoIs. A controlling stake in BPCL will give the acquirer access to 25.77% share in India’s fuel retailing market, along with 15.3% of India’s total refining capacity.

With this purchase, Vedanta Resources shareholding in the company will increase to 55.1%. As on 30 September, promoters held 50.13% in the company. As per Sebi norms, promoters are allowed to acquire up to 5% a year through creeping acquisition without triggering an open offer. Vedanta Holdings Mauritius, a subsidiary of Vedanta Resources bought 73.58 million and 111.42 million shares at an average price of ₹159.91 aggregating to Rs1,177 crore and Rs1,782 crore on BSE and NSE respectively, showed data on the stock exchanges. The details of the sellers were not disclosed. The stake purchase by the promoter comes after a failed attempt to delist the company from Indian stock exchanges earlier this year. In May, the promoters announced a delisting offer at ₹87.5 a share. The total number of shares validly tendered by the public shareholders in the delisting offer was 125.47 crore, which was less than the minimum number of shares required to be accepted by the acquirers in order for the delisting offer to be successful. Agarwal’s move to increase his stake in Vedanta also comes at a time when he is planning to acquire state owned Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) through a competitive bidding process under the government’s disinvestment program. Mint reported on 16 December that Agarwal’s Vedanta group plans to raise as much as $8 billion through a mix of debt and equity to secure funds for the acquisition of BPCL and that the group has initiated talks with a clutch of banks to tie up the funds. Last month, the mining conglomerate showed preliminary interest in buying the government’s 53% stake in BPCL. The sale, part of India’s asset-sale programme, is expected to fetch the government about ₹45,000 crore. Analysts, however, have questioned the group’s ability to raise the entire funding on its own, given its precarious finances. While BPCL’s dividend payments could cover the cost of debt of any acquisition, “the question we have is how would Vedanta Ltd (an Indian unit of Vedanta Resources) secure funding, given the worries on leverage at Vedanta and the parent,"" JP Morgan said in a report in November. Buying a 75% stake in BPCL (53% from government and 22% through an open offer) would cost Vedanta ₹64,200-97,600 crore depending on the price ( ₹395 to 600 per share), the report added. Vedanta Ltd reported 61.8% decline in consolidated net profit at ₹824 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 against a net profit of ₹2,158 crore in the year-ago period. Income during July-September declined 4.7% to ₹21,744 crore from ₹22,814 crore in the year-ago period. Shares of Vedanta Ltd gained 8.11% to close at ₹162.65 on Thursday on BSE, while the benchmark index, Sensex gained 1.14% to close at 46973.54 points."
