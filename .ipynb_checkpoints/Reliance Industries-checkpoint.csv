An unprecedented windfall tax on fuel exports, which pushed the stock down by as much as 9% on Friday, seemed to do the trick."
Updated: 04 Jul 2022,RIL shares: What brokerages say after windfall tax announcement,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/reliance-industries-ril-shares-what-brokerages-say-after-govt-s-windfall-tax-announcement-11656902501279.html,"The government on Friday imposed an export tax on petrol, diesel and jet fuel while also joining nations like the UK in imposing a windfall tax on crude oil produced locally. Govt's unprecedented move to tax diesel and gasoline exports is designed to cap refining profits of pvt refiners like Reliance Industries (RIL) in global brokerage Jefferies' view.  ""The impact of the move is a 4% cut to RIL's FY23E Ebitda as we were working with US$ 13/bbl GRM est. While we see no reason to cut refining Ebitda for FY24E (used in our SOTP) based on developments, the govt intervention prompts us to cut refining valuation multiple to 7x from 8x,"" the note stated. The  brokerage has lowered its price target on RIL shares to ₹2,900 while maintaining Buy tag. The government slapped a ₹23,230 per tonne additional tax on domestically produced crude oil to take away windfall gains accruing to producers from high international oil prices, as domestic crude producers sell crude to domestic refineries at international parity prices. As a result, the domestic crude producers are making windfall gains.  Though, brokerage Emkay has upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold as it believes that export taxes to dent gross refining margins (GRMs) but annual earnings resilient. The inclusion of the SEZ refinery was surprising, though tax officials quoted by media said that the imposition was in line with statute. The fortnightly review indicated by senior Finance Ministry officials implies that any downsides to broader GRMs would be protected, as per the brokerage. “We do not expect any downside risk to RIL’s earnings unless a decline in GRM is not offset by an export duty rollback (fortnightly review should take care). The outlook for Retail and Jio businesses is also steady, while higher gas prices and commissioning of MJ-1 field would support upstream earnings,"" Emkay added. After the recent correction, the brokerage house finds RIL stock's valuations attractive, but has lowered its March 2023 target price slightly to ₹2,800. The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint."

Updated: 02 Jul 2022,Windfall tax by government to impact oil and gas companies: Analysts ,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/windfall-tax-by-government-to-impact-oil-gas-companies-analysts-11656740952840.html,"Shares of oil and gas companies saw a steep fall on Friday following the government's move to levy duty on exports of auto fuel and impose a windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil. Reliance Industries stock closed 7.19% lower on Friday, seeing an intraday decline of more than 8%. ONGC and Oil India shares ended over 13% and 15% lower respectively on the BSE. “Export taxes, restrictions and windfall taxes on oil producers are a global trend and highlight the tightening energy market outlook,"" said analysts at Morgan Stanley Research in their report. As per the analysts, India's announcement is incrementally negative for sector valuations.  ONGC is most negatively impacted, while Reliance Industries can manage the changes comparatively better, analysts said. The government has imposed a special excise duty of ₹6 per litre on exports of petrol and aviation turbine fuel (ATF) and ₹13 per litre on exports of diesel. This, as per analysts, is expected to impact refiners and exporters such as Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy (Vadinar refinery).  It is the gains that these refiners were likely making while exporting refined crude products, that may have prompted the government to impose the taxes. Reliance Industries was seeing regular upgrades aided by strong and improving outlook for its oil to chemical business mainly led by strong refining margins. The government's move to levy a cess of ₹23,250 per tonne on domestically produced crude oil may impact the earnings of state-owned oil producers such as ONGC Ltd, Oil India Ltd and private sector Vedanta Ltd. With crude prices above $100 a barrel, the producers too had been making extraordinary profits. “Gasoline and diesel are the key contributors to Reliance's refining slate contributing 72% of refining throughput,"" as per analysts at Jefferies India Private Ltd. They estimate $7 a barrel blended impact on RIL excluding any exemption. “With ~58% of RIL's refined products being exported, the blended impact for Reliance could be ₹3.4 per litre translating to $7 a barrel impact on realized Gross Refining Margins,"" said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd in their report. Nevertheless, excluding the SEZ refinery, (if exempted), the impact on RIL's GRM would be just $1 per barrel.  The impact on state-owned oil and gas producers ONGC and Oil India is likely to be much more. Vedanta Ltd may see some impact on earnings due to higher taxes, but it is a producer of multiple natural resources and oil and gas production through its subsidiary Cairn India contributed only about 10% to revenues and 13% to Ebitda during FY22. Not surprising, Vedanta share prices declined just 4.04% compared to the steeper fall seen in stock prices of ONGC and Oil India. Higher cess on domestic crude production of $40 per barrel for ONGC and OIL India was a negative surprise and should imply downside risks for the sector, said analysts at Morgan Stanley Research. It impacts ONGC and OIL India earnings for FY23 by 36% and 24%, they said. Higher margins that oil and gas companies were enjoying due to elevated crude prices and gross refining margins (GRMs) should normalize now, said analysts. As the sector tailwind is gone, stock prices are getting adjusted to the new reality, said Manish Jeloka, co-head of products & solutions, Sanctum Wealth. Once the impact of news is over, the medium-to-long-term returns will depend on company-specific fundamentals, added Joleka Analysts were surprised by the government’s sudden move. An analyst at the domestic broking said that government has not specified any duration for these taxes. Further, there are no slabs as to at what level of crude prices the taxes are available, since the prices may not remain elevated forever, added analysts. “No sunset date has been specified though we believe this is an extraordinary measure given the inflated profit environment in refining today,"" said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd. Revenue secretary Tarun Bajaj on Friday said the government will review the windfall tax on petroleum and the duty on auto fuel export every 15 days for recalibration."
Updated: 02 Jul 2022,Reliance share price tanks over 7%. Is this fall a good buying opportunity?,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/reliance-share-price-tanks-over-7-is-this-fall-a-good-buying-opportunity-11656735107007.html,"Reliance Industries share price tanked over 7 per cent on Friday session following Government of India (GoI) levying taxes on windfall gains made by domestic refineries. Reliance share price on Friday opened with a downside gap of near ₹20 per share and went on to make its intraday low of ₹2,365 apiece, giving fear to its shareholders of hitting lower circuit. However, the stock pared its early morning losses in the second half and ended at ₹2,406 per share levels on NSE. According to stock market experts, export oriented oil manufacturing companies are expected to make staggering income from cheaper crude oil being available by the Russian government. In that scenario, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), which is one of the biggest diesel exporters in India is also expected to incur windfall gains. So, the GoI move aims to ask for its share in the additional income Reliance and other oil making companies are expected to collect after Russia-Ukraine war. They said that Reliance Industries shares are expected to feel the pressure as market is expected to further discount on Reliance shares when the market opens next week. Speaking on the reason for dip in Reliance share price, Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities said, ""GoI levying taxes on windfall gains made by domestic oil refineries has not gone down well on the Dalal Street. Reliance shares nosediving on Friday has to be seen from this perspective. As Reliance is one of the major diesel and other oil exporter company in India, it is expected to continue receiving the beating. So, Reliance shares may continue to remain under pressure next week as well because the market may further discount on this GoI move."" On what technical chart suggests in regard to Reliance share price pattern, Rohit Singre, AVP- Technical Research at Bonanza Portfolio said, ""Reliance share price has strong support at ₹2360 apiece levels. If the stock continues to remain above this level on first half of the Monday session, then only we can expect some rebound in the counter. Otherwise, negative bias would continue in the stock.""  Rohit Singre of Bonanza Portfolio went on to add that on breaching of ₹2360 support, there can be further sharp downside movement. So, those who want to take fresh buying position in the counter, they are advised to wait for some time as they might get this quality stock at more discounter price in next few sessions. Meanwhile, Prabhudas Lilladher has upgraded its Reliance Industries share target from ₹3,000 per share to ₹3,277 per share in long term citing, ""RIL with access to discounted Russian crude (discount at over USD 30/bbl) and EU exports is best placed to capitalize on tight market conditions, given high refining complexity. We believe higher gas prices along with strong growth in telecom (continued tariff hikes) and retail (store expansion), make RIL a preferred play in challenging times. Reiterate ‘BUY’ with revised PT of ₹3,277 per share."" Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint."
Updated: 01 Jul 2022,"RIL, ONGC shares crash after govt hikes export tax on petrol, diesel",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/govt-hikes-export-tax-on-petrol-diesel-and-atfs-ril-shares-see-sharp-fall-11656651138911.html,"The government on Friday announced an increase in taxes on the export of petrol, diesel, and aviation turbine fuel (ATF). The centre has also mandated exporters to meet the requirements of the domestic market first. The government has levied a ₹6 per litre tax on exports of petrol and ATF and ₹13 per litre on exports of diesel. The government has also announced taxes on windfall gains made by crude oil producers. The government also slapped a ₹23,230 per tonne additional tax on domestically produced crude oil to take away windfall gains accruing to producers from high international oil prices, a separate government notification showed. Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) witnessed a sharp fall after the export tax hike announcement. RIL shares plunged more than 5%, its biggest decline in about 18 months, whereas ONGC shares tanked 10% in Friday's early deals, while BSE Sensex was down nearly a per cent. “Reliance is witnessing a sharp fall after the Government has levied taxes on windfall gains made by domestic refineries. Earlier Reliance was firing on all cylinders but now there is a break in its refinery business as the commodity cycle is also reversing however other verticals have strong growth potential,"" said Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart Ltd. Fuels from Mukesh Ambani-led RIL's Jamnagar refinery are exported to several countries across the world.  Gasoline exporters have been asked to give a self declaration that 50% of the quantity mentioned in the shipping bill has been or will be supplied to the domestic market during the current financial year. The tax on exports follows oil refiners, particularly the private sector, reaping huge gains from exporting fuel to markets such as Europe and the US. The tax on domestically produced crude oil follows local producers reaping windfall gains from the surge in international oil prices.  Domestic petrol and diesel prices have been steady since May when the government announced a cut in excise duty on petrol by 8 per litre, and 6 rupees per litre on diesel on May 21, 2022. The domestic fuel prices are likely to remain low as the taxes announced today by the government do not impact them."
Updated: 01 Jul 2022,RIL brings Pret A Manger to India,https://www.livemint.com/companies/ril-brings-pret-a-manger-to-india-11656615130297.html,"NEW DELHI : After the fashion world, Reliance Brands Ltd (RBL) is eyeing the food and beverages space. The company has announced a strategic partnership with Pret A Manger, the UK-based fresh food and organic coffee chain that has more than 550 stores across the world, to launch and build the brand in India. Started in London in 1986, Pret A Manger, French for “ready to eat"", is known for its sandwiches, salads and wraps, besides coffee. As part of the master franchise partnership, Reliance Brands will open the food chain across the country, starting with major cities and travel hubs. In an interview, Pano Christou, the chief executive of Pret A Manger, said: “I think there’s a strong connection between the UK and India—the number of students that come to the UK, people travelling to the UK for pleasure. And I think that when you look at the younger population in India, they are going out more, eating out more, experimenting more. I think India is a very exciting market."" RBL, a unit of Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd, began operations in 2007 with a mandate to launch and build global brands in luxury to premium segments across fashion and lifestyle. In the past five years, RBL has invested in homegrown Indian designer labels, such as Manish Malhotra and Anamika Khanna, as well as partnering with international luxury and fashion brands. Its current portfolio of brand partnerships includes Armani Exchange, Bally, Bottega Veneta, Brooks Brothers, Burberry, Canali, Coach, Diesel, Dune, Emporio Armani, Ermenegildo Zegna, G-Star Raw, Gas, Giorgio Armani, Hamleys, Hugo Boss, Hunkemoller, Jimmy Choo, Kate Spade New York, Manish Malhotra, Michael Kors, Mothercare and Muji. “The secret sauce of RBL is understanding these 50 million consumers who have disposable income, travel the world and want to experience new things,"" said RBL’s managing director Darshan Mehta. “We follow the way these consumers spend their money, and what we have discovered is that there is an engagement and involvement in food as a category of consumption as much as in fashion. People are as much engaged in food experiences as in retail experiences. Frankly, I think food is the new fashion."" In a market crowded with Tata’s Starbucks stores and a growing number of homegrown coffee brands that also offer food, it would be interesting to see how Pret will fare. Both Christou and Mehta are confident. “We have a good brand and a proven track record, so I think we don’t have to worry about growth. The idea right now is to connect with the consumer and take it forward from there,"" says Mehta. To suit the Indian palate, the chain will make some changes to its global menu, details of which are still a work in progress. Regarding the specific number of stores and locations, Christou said: “We’d like to open our first store within the first fiscal year. And after that, we will evolve based on the response we get from the consumer."" Mehta added: “Indians, like their global counterparts, are seeking fresh and organic ingredient-led dining experiences. Couple that with the high recall the Pret brand enjoys in the country, it’s undoubtedly a recipe for success."""
Updated: 30 Jun 2022,Mukesh Ambani’s succession plan for Reliance gets clearer,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/mukesh-ambani-s-succession-plan-for-reliance-gets-clearer-11656606974741.html,"There was once a time that billionaire Mukesh Ambani and his younger brother, Anil, lived in the same Mumbai house with their mother even as they fought in Indian courts over their father’s empire. Dhirubhai Ambani had died in 2002 without a will—and thus the fraternal feud. As part of a 2005 family settlement, Mukesh had won control of deep-sea fields in the Bay of Bengal that had just started producing gas. But the agreement also required him to supply cheap feedstock at a fixed price for 17 years to Anil’s proposed power plant. Honouring that pact might have ended power outages in New Delhi, but it would have crippled Mukesh’s Reliance Industries. Luckily for the older sibling, a Supreme Court verdict in May 2010 went in his favour: The gas was held to be Indian sovereign property, not Mukesh’s to give. Two weeks later, the brothers agreed to live in “harmony"" and end most of the non-compete clauses of their separation, including in telecom, where Anil ran a service. Mukesh entered the market, a move that would catapult him to his current standing as the world’s 10th richest tycoon with a net worth of $90 billion. Since then, the gas discovery has proved to be a damp squib and many of Anil’s firms have gone bankrupt. It was symbolic, therefore, that when Mukesh Ambani put his own succession plan in motion this week, he started with Jio, his telecom service. His son Akash, 30, will succeed him as chairman at India’s top wireless carrier, though the patriarch will continue to helm Jio Platforms, which owns all digital assets. This may be a stopgap until Jio Platforms, whose investors include Meta and Alphabet Inc, concludes its much-awaited initial public offering. Akash’s twin sister Isha is widely expected to head Reliance’s retail business. Anant, 27, the youngest of the three children, may preside over the legacy oil-to-chemicals business. But with a twist: He must complete his dad’s pivot away from hydrocarbons towards cleaner energy. Mukesh Ambani only began talking about the “momentous leadership transition"" last December, at an employees’ event. It’s hard to say what the eventual arrangement will look like. But it wouldn’t be a surprise if retail, telecom and energy end up as professionally managed and independently listed companies, with equity participation—and operational support—from one or more strategic partners. In this scenario, the children, plus Ambani and his wife Nita, can exercise control through their shares in Reliance Industries, which will own stakes in Jio Platforms, Reliance Retail and the energy business, Reliance O2C. Such a structure won’t be without problems. Separate stock-market listings for the units could saddle Reliance with a permanent holding-company discount: the tendency of the stock market to value a conglomerate at less than the sum of its parts. But de-merging them—so that Reliance investors would directly own proportional stakes of entities—may erode the might of the consolidated balance sheet. Fitch Ratings assesses Reliance’s foreign-currency creditworthiness at BBB, a notch higher than India’s sovereign debt. Reliance has a major cost-of-capital advantage as it has high operating profits and very little debt, an edge that may be of great value to the next generation. If this is indeed the favoured template, then the model is in place for Jio Platforms minus an IPO: Google didn’t just invest in Jio, it also helped it with a cheap, Android-based phone; Facebook’s WhatsApp service could help local JioMart stores take customer orders and payments over phones. Ambani might have wanted to strike similar deals with Amazon in retail and with Saudi Aramco for his oil business. But instead of a partnership with Amazon, there’s now keen competition and Reliance’s courtship of Aramco collapsed. Worse, Bloomberg News reported that arch-rival Adani was flirting with Aramco. With so much going on, Mukesh Ambani will want as little boardroom drama as possible. When Mukesh and Anil Ambani were taking their gas dispute to court in 2009, the combined stock-market value of their empires was $108 billion—five times what they were worth before the family settlement. Now, Mukesh’s Reliance Industries is worth $221 billion, while pretty much the only value left in Anil’s group, outside of power generation, transmission and distribution, is whatever creditors can get from bankruptcy proceedings against several of his firms. For now, Ambani’s children will want to keep their ties to the Reliance mothership; which means they will have to accept the conglomerate’s capital-allocation policies even as they are free to do their own thing. That’s likely the best their father can do for them—and the group—without weakening the whole. It’s a better transition than what he had to endure.
