Updated: 30 Jun 2022,The bright side of Asian Paints’ recovery,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/asian-paints-beats-the-inflation-blues-with-robust-volume-growth-11656525265578.html,"The past few quarters have been lacklustre for the paint industry. Concerns over high raw material inflation, a slowdown in demand, and rising competition has taken the sheen away from paint stocks. Even the market leader in the decorative paints segment, Asian Paints Ltd, has not been spared. The stock slid to a 52-week low of ₹2,560 on 17 June on NSE and is now about 5% above that level. However, so far this calendar year, the stock has corrected by 20%. There are some bright spots that can soothe the frayed nerves of investors. An analysis by Antique Stock Broking suggests that during inflationary periods (FY11-12 and FY18-19), Asian Paints has absorbed part of the inflation to protect its volume growth and market share. “However, in subsequent years, the company has regained its margins by calibrated price hikes and operating scale,"" said Antique’s analysts in a report on 29 June.

Globally, shares extended their bounce on Monday, building on Friday's strong Wall Street close as off-peak oil prices helped sentiment improve and temper fears of prolonged inflation. In Asia, shares rose in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and South Korea.  Indian indices on Friday closed higher, posting gains for the third straight day, with technology and metal stocks leading the gains, as easing oil prices tempered inflation fears. The Sensex gained 457 points, or 0.82%, to close at 53,161.28, while Nifty50 jumped 132.80 points to end at 15,832.05. Sectorally, all the sectors ended in the green, with IT, metals, capital goods, telecom rising the most. On the 30-stock index, L&T, TechM, HCL, and Infosys were the top performers, while Reliance and Kotak Bank were the top losers. On the Nifty50 index, ONGC, Coal India, and L&T registered the biggest gains, while Eicher Motors and Apollo Hospitals were the biggest laggards.   Homegrown motorcycles and three-wheeler manufacturer's board on Monday have approved share buyback of up to ₹2,500 crore at a price not exceeding ₹4,600 per share, via open market. Bajaj Auto shares were trading 0.7% higher at ₹3,840 apiece on the BSE in Monday's afternoon deals.   More than a quarter of India’s micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) lost over 3% market share due to the covid pandemic, while half of them saw their earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margins contract because of a sharp rise in commodity prices last fiscal compared with pre-pandemic (fiscal 2020) levels, a CRISIL Research’s SME Report 2022 said.   Global brokerage and research firm JPMorgan's recent CIOs survey, conducted by its US Tech team, indicated that IT budgets are expected to contract 1-2% in ‘real terms’ growing 5/6% in nominal terms over CY22/23 vs inflation of 6-8%.   Shares of food aggregator Zomato tumbled sharply on Monday after the company's Board of Directors approved a proposal to acquire a cash-strapped quick commerce company Blinkit for ₹4,447 crore. The proposed acquisition will be an all-stock deal. Last year, Zomato extended $50 million loans to Grofers India Private Limited, which has now been renamed as Blink Commerce.   Domestic brokerage and research firm ICICI Securities has Hold ratings on Navin Fluorine, Galaxy Surfactants, and Rossari Biotech shares whereas it has Buy tags on specialty chemical stocks Sudarshan Chemical, EPL, Chemplast Sanmar, Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Tatva Chintan Pharma Chem and PCBL.   Recessions in advanced economies may benefit India in a “perverse way"" as a moderation in global commodities prices will help cool domestic inflation, according to Citigroup Inc.’s head of economics for the country. “India being a net importer of commodities should benefit on the inflation front,"" Samiran Chakraborty, managing director and chief economist for India at Citigroup, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Monday. He added that India would still face face pressures from a global slowdown as it will crimp exports and economic growth. “Since, at this moment, policy making is entirely focused on inflation control, it appears to be that in a perverse way this can benefit India to some extent,"" Chakraborty said. The Reserve Bank of India has raised its benchmark interest rate by 90 basis points since May and is poised to hike further to bring down inflation that has remained above its mandate since the beginning of the year.   Tokyo stocks marked three straight winning sessions on Monday, extending strong rallies on Wall Street, where the weakening economic outlook moderated expectations for central bank monetary tightening. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed up 1.43 percent, or 379.30 points, at 26,871.27, while the broader Topix index added 1.11 percent, or 20.70 points, at 1,887.42. The dollar stood at 134.95 yen, off slightly from 135.17 yen in New York late Friday. Fresh, weak US data fuelled speculation that inflation might have peaked or was nearing it.   State-owned Hindustan Copper Ltd's board will meet this week to consider a proposal to raise up to ₹500 crore by issuing debentures. ""A meeting of the board of directors of Hindustan Copper Ltd (HCL) will be held on 30th June 2022 to inter alia, consider and recommend resolutions seeking approval of the shareholders of the company to authorise the board of directors...to offer, issue and allot secured or unsecured non-convertible debentures or bonds on a private placement basis up to ₹500 crore,"" the PSU said in a BSE filing.

The dollar stood at 134.95 yen, off slightly from 135.17 yen in New York late Friday. Fresh, weak US data fuelled speculation that inflation might have peaked or was nearing it.   Rating agency Icra has re-affirmed the credit rating of Edelweiss Financial Services Limited's retail NCD programme to A+, and upgraded its outlook from negative to stable.   Australian shares closed higher on Monday, recording their best day in nearly five months, as firm commodity prices powered mining stocks and investors bought stocks that witnessed a selloff recently. The S&P/ASX 200 closed 1.9% higher at 6,706.00 points — its biggest one-day gain since Jan. 28. The benchmark also rose for a third straight day.   The dollar and Japanese yen both found support in a choppy Asia session on Monday, benefiting from a bid for safety as investors worried rising interest rates and softening economic data could signal a global recession is on the horizon. While stocks followed Wall Street higher, currency traders were wary of extending Friday's dollar selling too much because the dollar typically rises in times of uncertainty. [MKTS/GLOB] The risk-sensitive Australian dollar was shaky along with commodity prices through the Asia session, and was last down 0.1% at $0.6935. The euro was pinned at $1.0564. The beaten-down yen steadied at 134.81 per dollar. The U.S. dollar index was steady at 104.000, after reaching a 20-year peak of 105.79 earlier in the month.   Axis Bank on Friday said the Reserve Bank has approved the reappointment of Rajiv Anand as the Deputy MD for a period of three years until August 2025. In January this year, the private sector lender had re-appointed Anand as the Deputy Managing Director for a further period of three years, from August 4, 2022, to August 3, 2025 (both days inclusive). It was subject to the approval of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).   Rating: BUY | CMP: Rs421 | TP: Rs553 GGAS has underperformed the broader index by ~50% over last four months, as geopolitical tensions keep spot LNG prices at elevated levels of >USD30/mmbtu. Reports of ceramic units in Morbi switching to propane usage (competing fuel) have also impacted the stock performance. At CMP stock trades closer to -1 standard deviation consensus PER of last three years of 17.6x. We believe GGAS is very well placed to navigate this situation and has tied spot LNG purchase till Feb 2023 at ~USD28/mmbtu, when winter gas demand from EU will be highest. In the near term, we do not expect GGAS to compete with propane as prices are seasonally weak in Q2 and will increase in H2 (prices are higher in H2 for last five years except in FY19 due to pandemic). Further, sustained high spot LNG prices due to geopolitical tension will lead to more users setting up LPG plants which could put GGAS margins under pressure. In a high gas cost environment, we expect GGAS to prioritize margins over volumes (like in Q4FY22) and limit spot purchase to contracted amount. We lower our FY23/24E volumes by ~6%, but factor in higher margins and our earnings change is ~6% for FY23E. We factor in ~9% volume growth and ~18% CAGR earnings growth over FY22-24E. We also reduce medium term volumes, even as we maintain margins of ~Rs6/scm and increase risk free rate to 7.4% (6.5% earlier) Accordingly, our revised DCF based PT stands at Rs553 (Rs650). Reiterate ‘BUY’.   Orient Electric’s aggressive investments in R&D and ad-spend have helped it build competitive advantages in consumer electricals. With distribution expansion, it has gained market share across segments (fans, consumer durables) over the past decade. We believe the company has the potential to grow higher than the industry growth of ~15% due to (1) differentiated launches, (2) distribution expansion and (3) steady expansion of product portfolio. We model the company’s EBITDA margin to correct 30bps in FY24E due to prevailing input material inflation. We model 15.2% and 17.2% CAGRs in revenue and PAT over FY22-24E. We initiate coverage on the stock with an ADD rating and a DCF-based target price of Rs285 (implying 35x FY24E EPS). Key risks: Potentially higher competitive intensity and delay in distribution expansion.   Shares rose broadly across Asia on Monday, building on morning gains and a Friday Wall Street rebound as sentiment improved and oil prices steadied, tempering fears of prolonged inflation. Treasury yields remained subdued and the dollar hovered near the lowest in more than a week as investors continued to assess the outlook for U.S. rate hikes, and the potential for a recession. Japan's Nikkei rallied 1.51%, while Australia's benchmark jumped 2.03% and looked set for its best day in more than six weeks. Chinese blue chips rose 1.17% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 2.39%. South Korea's KOSPI gained 1.83%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares rose 1.81%. U.S. stock futures are up slightly by 0.8% after falling earlier in the day. On Friday, the S&P 500 surged more than 3%, adding to an almost 1% gain on Thursday. FTSE futures and EUROSTOXX 50 futures both rose 0.45% ahead of the start of European market trading.   China plans to extend the yuan’s trading hours as it seeks to increase global investor participation in onshore currency trading as part of its internationalization push. Regulators led by the People’s Bank of China have told some banks to prepare for an extension of onshore yuan trading hours, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The trading will close at 3 a.m. the next day, instead of the 11:30 p.m. local time, the people said. It’s not known when the change would be effective. The PBOC had pledged to extend currency trading hours and vowed to further open up the financial market in May after the International Monetary Fund lifted yuan’s weighting in the Special Drawing Rights currency basket. China last tweaked yuan trading hours in 2016 when extended trading by seven hours.   The handover of Odisha-based Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL) to a Tata group firm is likely to be completed by mid of July, an official said. Tata Steel Long Products (TSLP) had in January emerged as the winning bidder, putting in bids worth ₹12,100 crore for loss-making NINL, which is a joint venture of 4 CPSEs -- MMTC, NMDC, BHEL, MECON and 2 Odisha government PSUs -- OMC and IPICOL. Following that, in March TSLP signed a share purchase agreement with NINL.   We visited the multi-tenanted BTS facility of Mahindra Logistics (MLL) in Luhari, Haryana. Two blocks have come up (FC + DC for three clients and a FC for Amazon) with one more block under construction. Three blocks put together have an area of 1.4mn sqft. The entire 1.4mn sqft has been contracted out to customers. Bajaj Electricals contributed ~70% of the volumes in the first block of ~0.5mn sqft, which we visited. With Luhari, MLL's BTS portfolio has reached 2.4mn sqft, which the management intends to take up to 6mn sqft in medium term. MLL expects significant improvement in gross margins in end-to-end solutions contract with maturity (12-18 months); reiterated FY26 revenue target of Rs100bn and a significant improvement in profitability concurrently. We maintain ADD on MLL with a revised target price of Rs465 (earlier: Rs550/share).   Gold prices gained on Monday, as news of some Western nations planning to officially ban imports of the metal from Russia for its invasion of Ukraine sparked some interest in bullion. Spot gold rose 0.5% to $1,835.75 per ounce by 0520 GMT. U.S. gold futures were up 0.4% at $1,837.30. ""The G7 import ban on Russian gold seems to be providing some short-term support in early Asia (trading),"" OANDA senior analyst Jeffrey Halley said. ""However, it is mostly a rubber stamp exercise in reality for the grouping, and I do not expect this to mark a structural change in the supply/demand outlook that will underpin prices.""   Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., the automaker that sells every other car on the nation’s roads, believes electric vehicles aren’t the answer to reducing carbon emissions in the world’s third-biggest releaser of greenhouse gases -- at least not in the immediate future.   While announcing its earnings for fourth quarter ended March 31, 2022, Bajaj Auto had said its board also recommended a dividend of ₹140 per share of ₹10 each (1,400 per cent) subject to approval of shareholders.   An investment like a Bitcoin should not be where you park your maximum savings. They should be the high risk-high return part of your overall corpus.   Oil prices extended gains on Monday as investors stood on guard for any moves against Russian oil and gas exports that might come out of a meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) nations meeting in Germany. The prospect of more supply tightness loomed over the market as western governments sought ways to cut Russia's ability to fund its war in Ukraine, even though G7 leaders were also expected discuss a revival of the Iran nuclear deal - which might lead to more Iranian oil exports. Producer nations in OPEC+, which includes Russia, will likely stick to a plan for accelerated oil output increases in August when they meet on Thursday, sources said. But, for now, the pressing supply worries outweighed growing concerns over the potential for a global recession following a string of downbeat U.S. economic data. Brent crude futures edged up 22 cents, or 0.2%, to $113.34 a barrel by 0342 GMT after rebounding 2.8% on Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $107.73 a barrel, up 11 cents, or 0.1%, following a 3.2% gain in the previous session.   London copper prices gained on Monday as the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in top metals consumer China raised hopes of a revival in demand, although fears of a global economic slowdown due to rapid interest rate hikes limited gains. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 0.5% at $8,420 a tonne, as of 0441 GMT, after dropping to its lowest since February 2021 at $8,122.50 in the previous session.   High-yielding emerging-Asia currencies may continue to reel amid deteriorating external finances and risk-off sentiment spurred by Federal Reserve tightening, according to strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “Along with the broader emerging market currency complex, high-yielding currencies like the Philippine peso, Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah have been under pressure in June,"" strategists including Zach Pandl and Danny Suwanapruti wrote in a research note. “In coming weeks, we expect this pressure to continue versus the dollar, in some cases potentially posing upside risks to our dollar-cross forecasts."" Emerging-Asia currencies are facing the heat as the Fed’s campaign to curb inflation boosts the dollar while central banks in much of Asia adopt a more patient stance. India’s rupee declined to an all-time low last week, while the Philippine peso slumped to its weakest level in more than 16 years. Goldman’s views on India rupee The rupee, which tested a series of record lows in recent weeks, may continue to remain under pressure against the dollar amid expectations of a $40 billion balance of payments deficit this year, compared with a surplus of $55 billion in 2021. The rupee typically depreciates when faced with balance of payments deficits, and therefore Goldman expects that upward pressure on dollar-rupee may persist in coming months.   Online food delivery platform Zomato Ltd announced that it has agreed to acquire Blink Commerce Pvt Ltd (formerly known as Grofers), where it already owns an 8-9% stake, for ₹4,447 crore in a share swap deal as part of its strategy of investing in quick commerce business.   The rupee appreciated 6 paise to 78.27 against the US dollar in opening trade on Monday as heavy buying in domestic equities and weakness in the greenback strengthened investor sentiment. However, elevated crude prices and persistent foreign fund outflows restricted the rupee's gain, forex dealers said. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened sharply up at 78.24 against the US dollar, then inched lower to quote 78.27, registering a gain of 6 paise over the last close. In the previous session, the rupee had closed at its all-time low of 78.33 against the US dollar.

Elsewhere in Asia, markets in Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai and Hong Kong were trading with gains in mid-session deals. The US markets had ended with sharp gains on Friday.   Homegrown Bajaj Auto's board will meet on Monday, June 27, 2022 to further deliberate on the proposal for buyback of fully paid-up equity shares of the company.

Foreign investors continue to desert Indian equity markets and pulled out close to ₹46,000 crore so far this month following monetary policy tightening by the Reserve Bank and US Federal Reserve, high oil prices and volatile rupee. The net outflow by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) from equities reached ₹2.13 lakh crore unitll now in 2022, data with depositories showed. Given the policy normalisation narrative by the US Fed and other major central banks, coupled with high oil prices and volatile Rupee, FPIs are likely to stay away from emerging market assets, Hitesh Jain, Lead Analyst - Institutional Equities, Yes Securities, said. FPIs inflow will only resume once there is visibility on the peak of bond yields in the US and an end to Fed rate hikes, he added. Moreover, FPIs are likely to sell more if the current trend of rising dollar and bond yields persists, said VK Vijayakumar, Cheif Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.   6 stocks to buy today — 27th June   A total of four stocks have been put under the ban for trade on Monday, June 27, 2022 under the futures and options (F&O) segment by the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

The S&P/ASX 200 index rose 1.5% to 6,676.5 by 0106 GMT, extending gains to a third session. Investors also took cues from Friday's strong gains in global stocks, as a recent slide in commodity prices eased worries about soaring inflation and the rate hike outlook.   London copper prices rose on Monday as the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in top metals consumer China raised hopes of a revival in demand, although fears of a global economic slowdown due to rapid interest rate hikes limited gains. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 0.9% at $8,452.50 a tonne, as of 0156 GMT, after dropping to its lowest since February 2021 at $8,122.50 in the previous session.  The most-traded August copper contract in Shanghai was flat at 64,430 yuan ($9,627.63) a tonne.   Oil fluctuated near $107 a barrel as investors monitored developments from the gathering of Group of Seven leaders, while fears of a demand-sapping recession continued to hang over the market. West Texas Intermediate swung between gains and losses after rising 3.2% on Friday. The US benchmark still posted its first back-to-back weekly loss since April. The G-7 will commit to providing indefinite support to Ukraine for its defense against Russia, and is weighing a price cap on the nation’s oil. Oil is heading for its first monthly decline since November on escalating fears about a global slowdown as central banks hike interest rates to combat surging inflation. Retail prices for products like gasoline haven’t fallen anywhere near as fast as crude, however, due to a shortage of capacity to make fuels.   Stocks gained in Asia on Monday amid improved risk sentiment after Wall Street rebounded strongly at the end of last week as oil prices eased, tempering fears of prolonged inflation and the accompanying aggressive Federal Reserve tightening.

On Friday, the S&P 500 surged more than 3%, adding to an almost 1% gain on Thursday.   Stocks extended a climb Monday though questions remain about how long the equity bear market can be kept at bay amid high inflation, monetary tightening and the risk of a recession. Shares rose in Japan, Australia and South Korea. US futures declined in the wake of a more than 3% surge on Wall Street on Friday that cemented the best week for global equities in a month. Treasuries were steady. Yields have retreated from June highs as growth worries take center stage, leaving the US 10-year rate at 3.13%. Whether that marks the end of the Treasury bear market is another live debate. A gauge of the dollar was little changed, while the yen posted modest gains. Oil dropped to about $106 a barrel, sapped again by concerns about demand. Traders are also monitoring a summit of the Group of Seven leaders, who plan to commit to indefinite support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s invasion.

Tokyo stocks closed flat on Thursday as investors eyed signs of growing economic activity in Japan after the easing of pandemic restrictions. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index ended up 0.08 percent, or 21.70 points, at 26,171.25, while the broader Topix index was down 0.05 percent, or 0.91 points, at 1,851.74. Although the Tokyo market started with gains led by blue-chip exporters, market sentiment ""lacked the appetite for further active buying"", said Mamiko Katayama, a Daiwa Securities strategist.   Asian markets mostly rose Thursday on bargain buying after the previous day's battering, though oil extended losses after US Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell admitted the economy could tip into recession as the bank hikes interest rates to fight runaway inflation. Soaring prices and the battle by central banks to rein them in have sent a chill through global trading floors this year, while investors are also having to deal with the uncertainty wrought by the Ukraine war and patchy pandemic recovery. Commentators have warned for some time that the world economy could be heading for another contraction owing to the sharp increase in borrowing costs and rampant inflation, which is at decades highs in several countries.   Oil prices continued to retreat on Thursday as investors reassessed the risks of recession and the impact of interest rate hikes in major economies on fuel demand.

Rating: BUY | CMP: Rs2,485 | TP: Rs3,340 We interacted with senior management of PI Industries (PI) to take an update on the business and outlook ahead. Key highlights: (a) The company remains confident on achieving growth guidance of 18-20% YoY for FY23 in both exports and domestic segment (supported by lower base of last year); (b) remunerative commodity prices bode well for domestic market; (c) delayed monsoons have an impact on placements; however, remains hopeful of monsoon revival; (d) to launch 5-6 products in domestic market in FY23; (e) CSM business continues to be the shop stopper with mix changing to 80:20 for Agri and non-agri, going forward; (f) Pharma acquisition still in evaluation stages; likely to be done in next couple of quarters. Going forward, PI remains confident on the core business and its growth guidance with margins likely to improve from current levels, primarily led by strong enquiries in CSM business and new launches in domestic segment. We believe, the stock has corrected ~35% from its recent highs, thus providing a good entry point with strong earnings visibility in its core business. We broadly maintain FY23/FY24 EPS. We expect PI to report revenue/PAT CAGR of 18%/ 23% (FY11-22, 20%/26%) over FY22-24E. Maintain ‘BUY’ with unchanged TP of INR3,340 based on 40xFY24 EPS.   India's government will not be able to cut its budget deficit this fiscal year as previously projected, officials said, but will seek to cap the shortfall at last year's level to prevent a major deterioration in public finances. Efforts to maintain some fiscal discipline reflect New Delhi's concern around risks to its sovereign credit rating but will likely limit the government's firepower to contain inflation and provide relief to households and businesses. In February, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government set a fiscal deficit target of 6.4% of gross domestic output (GDP) for the year that started on April 1, compared with a deficit of 6.7% last year. The sources said that while increased spending to provide relief from inflation meant the government would miss this year's target, policymakers would seek to limit the deviation to 30 basis points.

Wider trade deficit driven by higher imports of goods led to India's current account slipping into deficit, at 1.2% of GDP for FY22 against a surplus of 0.9% of GDP in FY21. In absolute terms, the deficit for FY22 came at $38.7 billion as against a surplus of $24 billion in the year-ago period, data released by the RBI showed. Current account balances are generally taken as a key representative of a country's external strength, and a widening in the past had led to rupee depreciation and also actions by rating agencies on the sovereign rating.   Shares of Reliance Industries have corrected about 12% from its recent high.

Solana, Cardano, Polkadot and Dogecoin all declined.   Asian stocks wavered Thursday, Treasuries held a rally and oil sank as investors parsed the economic outlook after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the risk of a recession. An Asian share index was steady, with a report that Hong Kong’s incoming leader John Lee is working on a strategy to reopen the city’s borders helping sentiment. US and European futures were in the red. Treasuries were little changed after jumping in the Wall Street session, leaving policy-sensitive two-year yields at about 3.06%. Bonds jumped in Australia and New Zealand. The dollar and the yen inched higher. In commodities, oil dropped 3% to under $103 a barrel, sapped by fears over the demand outlook. A raw-materials index is at the lowest since March.   India’s central bank appears to have ramped up intervention in the forwards market to slow the rupee’s decline and preserve its hard-earned reserves. The Reserve Bank of India has run down its forward-dollar book by $12 billion to $15 billion from about $64 billion at the end of April, according to estimates by DBS Bank Ltd. Standard Chartered Plc. said the authority has significantly intervened through forwards. The move shows the central bank is pulling out all the stops to curb losses in the currency, which set a series of record lows this month and threatens to further accelerate inflation. The RBI’s intervention strategy has caused dollar-rupee one-year annualized forward premiums to fall below 3% for the first time in a decade, according to Standard Chartered.   Oil retreated along with other key commodities as concern over a global economic slowdown intensified, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warning that a US recession is possible. West Texas Intermediate sank toward $103 a barrel after closing at a six-week low on Wednesday. The US benchmark has lost more than 15% since the close on June 8 as the drumbeat of warnings over the state of the world’s economy has grown steadily louder, drowning out signs the oil market remains tight. Powell said while he didn’t see the likelihood of a recession as particularly elevated, it was a possibility. Commodity price hikes were “clearly"" connected to the war in Ukraine, he said. Crude’s retreat has been accompanied by deep losses in other raw materials, especially base metals such as copper.   London copper prices dropped to a 16-month low on Thursday, as worried mounted that a rise in Covid-19 cases in key consumer China and aggressive U.S. interest rate hikes would tip the global economy into recession and slow metals demand. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was down 1.7% at $8,628.50 a tonne, as of 0330 GMT, after dropping to its lowest since Feb. 19, 2021 at $8,564.50 earlier in the session. The most-traded July copper contract in Shanghai slipped 2.9% to 66,030 yuan ($9,848.02) a tonne by the midday break, hitting its lowest since late-August.   Sugar stocks have been nosediving for near one month after Government of Indian (GoI) levied excise duty on sugar export. Quality sugar stocks like Dhampur Sugar Mills, Mawana Sugars, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries, Shree Renuka Sugars, EID Parry, etc. have corrected heavily from its respective 52-week high.   The US economy remains strong but a series of aggressive rate hikes meant to cool soaring inflation could eventually trigger a recession, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned Wednesday. Powell, whose testimony before senators was closely watched by investors and analysts, also said the world's largest economy faces an ""uncertain"" global environment and could see further inflation ""surprises."" The Fed chair again stressed that policymakers understand the hardships caused by rising prices and are committed to bringing down inflation, which has reached a 40-year high. Last week, the US central bank announced the sharpest interest rate increase in nearly 30 years and promised additional similar moves to combat the price surge, with gas and food costs skyrocketing and millions of Americans struggling to get by.   An early look at the state of the US job market in June from payroll provider UKG suggests some strengthening, even as the Federal Reserve lifts interest rates sharply and economists raise alarms over the likelihood of a recession. Workforce activity increased slightly in the first two weeks of the month, according to the firm which tracks shift work in real time. It mostly declined during the prior three months. Particularly notable, the firm said, was an increase in demand for workers in retail, the first such increase since the start of the year. That could be good news for Fed Chair Jerome Powell. On Wednesday he told US lawmakers the Fed was committed to bringing down too-high inflation, with a plan to raise borrowing costs high enough that demand for labour, goods and services subsides to levels more in line with supply.   Tokyo shares opened higher as investors gauged inflation and recession risks after US Fed chair Jerome Powell pointed to the need for further rate hikes. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.22 percent or 58.77 points to 26,208.32 while the broader Topix index added 0.41 percent or 7.62 points to 1,860.27.   Gold prices were a touch lower on Thursday, with some support from a weaker dollar and US Treasury yields, after the Federal Reserve's head said the central bank was fully committed to reining in inflation, and would try not to spark a recession in the process. Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1,835.88 per ounce by 0109 GMT. US gold futures also inched 0.1% lower to $1,837.30.   A choppy day of trading on Wall Street ended with a modest pullback for stocks Wednesday, the latest bout of volatility for the market amid concerns about inflation and uncertainty over whether rising interest rates will help or hinder the economy. The indexes were on pace for a modest gain before slipping into the red in the final minutes of trading. The S&P 500 dropped 0.1%, with the stocks in the benchmark index about evenly split between gainers and decliners. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 0.2% and the Nasdaq fell 0.1%. Energy companies helped pull the market lower after the price of U.S. crude oil fell 4%. Technology companies also lost ground, which helped keep gains in health care, real estate and other sectors in check. Investors closely watched testimony to Congress from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. He reaffirmed the central bank’s determination to raise interest rates and slow inflation.  "

Asian Paints' shares opened at ₹2622.05 and closed at ₹2,641.00 today, indicating a 0.74 per cent decline from its previous closing of ₹2660.75. The stock touched a 52-week low on the NSE today at ₹2,585 in morning deals and had touched a 52-week high of ₹3,590 on January 10, 2022, indicating that the stock, after hitting a 52-week low today, is trading at a 26 per cent discount from its 52-week-high.

Asian Paints' shares have fallen 20.02 per cent in the previous six months, and the stock has fallen 22.83 per cent year to date (YTD) so far in 2022. After touching an intraday low today of ₹2585 (-2.89%), Asian Paints is now trading below the 5-day, 20-day, 50-day, 100 days, and 200-day moving averages. US monetary policy tightening, which may influence key growth sectors like housing and automobiles, new Covid variants and their impact on global business operations, geopolitical tensions such as higher crude oil prices which is at a record high level of ₹121 since 2008, inflation, economic and forex crisis in the global economy are the key factors for the share price to fall. The brokerage firm HDFC Securities has given a ‘HOLD’ rating on the shares of Asian Paints and have said in a note that “We are impressed with the overall performance in Q4FY22 despite the challenging environment of weak consumer sentiments and inflation across the raw material basket. The management continues to focus on its execution capabilities towards increasing distribution reach, launching breakthrough innovative products, and expanding the Home Décor portfolio. However, the near-term challenge still persists and we would wait to see if the visibility of the near term performance sustains before we change our rating to BUY. We continue to maintain our HOLD rating with an unchanged TP of ₹3,200 (57x FY24E EPS)."" Brokerage firm IDBI Capital has said in a note by giving a ‘HOLD’ rating that “Asian Paints (APNT) reported in-line result. Volume growth trend in decorative is encouraging at 8%YoY on a high base of 48%. This performance is despite soft business in Jan’22 due to Omicron. In Home Décor; APNT guides for complete control on value chain with almost all categories being owned/manufactured by the brand. APNT expects revenue contribution from Home Decor to double from 4% to 8-10% by FY26. Gross and EBITDA margin contraction subsided due to calibrated price hikes in Nov-Dec’21. Further; APNT took 2% price hike in AprMay’22 and expects 5% more price hike in 1QFY23. As per revised outlook; we have marginally trimmed our EPS estimate by 3-4% in FY23-24E. We have cut our multiple to 65x. Our target price stands at ₹3,453 with HOLD rating."" ICICI Securities have said “Strong brand, market leadership position and a robust balance sheet condition justify APL’s premium valuation. APL has been a consistent compounder with stock price appreciating at 22% CAGR over the last five years. We change our rating on stock from BUY to HOLD. We revise our target price to ₹3400/share and value APL at 65x P/E FY24E EPS."" The most current RSI indicator of ₹30.20 indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Over the previous two to three years, the firm has maintained a respectable ROE of more than 23%, and what seems appealing is that the company has a ROCE of 30.27 per cent for March 2022, which is greater than the ROE of 23.48 per cent. It signifies that the firm has used debt in a good manner to decrease its weighted average cost of capital. However, the stock has a book value per share of 148.03, which is 17.8 times its book value at the present level.

The data are expected to show annual consumer-price gains of more than 8%.  India's benchmark indices slumped today, registering their worst week in four, led by losses in IT, financials, banks and metal stocks. Declines were largely the result of a surge in oil prices and concerns over aggressive tightening by central banks to rein in high inflation. European stocks also extended losses as investors braced for US inflation data that may help decide the course of the Federal Reserve’s tightening path. Back home, the benchmark Sensex tanked 1,017 pts to end the day at 54,303.44, while the Nifty fell 276.30 points to 16,201.80. All sectoral indices ended in the red. On the Nifty, Bajaj Finance, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Hindalco and Reliance Industries were the worst hit. Shares of Grasim, Apollo Hospitals, Dr Reddy's, Asian Paints and Divis Labs rose.

The same stood at 4,44,131 units in the preceding year.   Nifty June series sentiment remains weak. Sell on rise advisable for the near term. Only a strong matured reversal will change the monthly outlook. Selective stocks are available at medium term value levels while broadly risk reward remains skewed. Liquidity remains the main reason behind the current corrective phase.   Gold discounts in India this week were stretched to their highest level in seven weeks as higher prices repelled demand, while fresh concerns over the spread of COVID in top-consumer China left buyers reluctant to make purchases. This week, dealers in India were offering a discount of up to $10 an ounce over official domestic prices — inclusive of the 10.75% import and 3% sales levies, up from the last week's discount of $9. Retail buying in India will remain weak, especially from rural areas as farmers focus on planting of summer-sown crops, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a private bullion importing bank.   European shares extended losses to a fourth session on Friday, as market participants braced for May U.S. inflation data that could guide the Federal Reserve's policy decision next week. All sectors were trading well in negative territory, with banks weighing the most on the pan-European STOXX 600 index, which lost 1.3%. The index was on course to end the week about 2.5% lower - its sharpest decline since early May.

The basket of crude oil that India buys has hit a decade high of $121 per barrel, but retail selling prices of petrol and diesel continue to remain frozen. The Indian basket on June 9 touched $121.28, matching levels seen in February/March 2012, according to data available from the oil ministry's Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC). As per the PPAC, the Indian basket of crude oil averaged $111.86 per barrel between February 25 and March 29 - the immediate period after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent oil on fire. It averaged $103.44 a barrel between March 30 and April 27. International oil prices held near a 13-week high on Thursday, underpinned by robust demand from key buyers like the US.   India’s economy expanded 8.7% in the fiscal year ended March 2022, the world’s quickest pace.

India, the world's third biggest oil importer and consumer, has expedited efforts to double ethanol blending with gasoline to 20% from the current 10% across the country from 2025/26. The Indian government fixes the ethanol purchase prices for fuel retailers - Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp -- every marketing year. However, the fuel retailers have announced they will pay extra to ethanol manufacturers to compensate for high energy and power costs, a BPCL spokesman said. The three state fuel retailers have announced the 'relief scheme' for June 1 to Nov. 30. The companies will pay an additional 1,604 rupees ($20.62) per kilolitre for ethanol produced from sugar cane juice, and 1,493 rupees for B- heavy molasses and 1,179 rupees for ethanol produced from C-heavy molasses, the letter showed. The B-heavy molasses juice has some sucrose content left in them for sugar production, whereas C-heavy molasses is a cane by-product that has no sugar content left in it. For a kilolitre of ethanol produced from damaged foodgrains and rice, the relief is fixed at 2,337 rupees and 1,437 rupees, the letter showed. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070, and is encouraging industries to switch to cleaner options including renewable and biofuels to cut carbon footprint.   The IMF has said it was concerned by the use of food and fertilizer export restrictions by some nations which can exacerbate global price increases and market volatility and welcomed India's recent decision to relax its originally announced ban on wheat exports and allow some shipments to proceed. A senior International Monetary Fund official observed that some 30 countries have curtailed exports of commodity goods including food and fuel since the war in Ukraine began.   (Details here).   The Indian Metrological Department (IMD) has forecasted a normal monsoon for calendar year 2022. In its second long-range forecast, IMD said that it expects rainfall during the current monsoon season to be 103% of the long-period average. For the fourth year in a row, the monsoon season is expected to be normal. However, in a report dated 9 June, economists at Barclays said, “Despite an early start, the progress of monsoon has been tepid so far. Cumulative rainfall during 1-9 June was 41% below the long-period average (LPA), though it remains too early to draw any meaningful conclusions, given that it is still very early in the monsoon season.""

(Read here)   Fitch Ratings on Friday revised its outlook on India's long-term foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to ""Stable"" from ""Negative,"" citing diminished downside risks to medium-term growth. The ratings agency said risks to the country's medium-term growth lessened due to rapid economic recovery and easing financial sector weaknesses, despite near-term headwinds from the global commodity price shock.   We believe strong support for the Nifty is placed at 16100 zone. However, for a meaningful pullback to materialise the index needs to decisively close above past three session’s identical high of 16500 to extend the pullback towards last week’s high of 16800. Else, there will be prolonging of consolidation in the 16500-16100 range amid stock specific action   Dasatinib is indicated for treatment of adult patients with i) newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase. ii) chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib. iii) Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.

Malaysia's May palm oil end-stocks fell 7.37% from the month before to 1.52 million tonnes, data from industry regulator the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) showed on Friday. Crude palm oil production edged down 0.07% from April to 1.46 million tonnes, while palm oil exports jumped 26.67% to 1.36 million tonnes, MPOB said. A Reuters survey forecast end-May inventories to shrink 6% to 1.54 million tonnes. Production was seen falling 4% to 1.4 million tonnes. Exports was seen up 20% at 1.27 million tonnes.   The US inflation data, due today, is expected to set the tone for the US Fed’s next policy decision. While a 50 basis point is very much in the cards, the forward looking commentary for future action could be greatly influenced by today’s data. While many have been peddling the possibility of the inflationary trend to be levelling out, today’s data will possibly validate or negate the same. Globally, the central banks seem to be operating in unison to stamp out inflation using interest rate hikes. The ECB announced on Thursday that it will prepare a quarter-point interest rate hike in July and suggested a bigger hike in the fall over long-lasting high inflation. The inflation in the Eurozone now exceeds 8%. The ECB also said that it will end net asset purchases on July 1, 2022. This didn’t build confidence for the bullion bulls, resulting in small correction in prices . Rising US treasury yields didn’t help the cause either.   Gold edged down on Friday and was set for a weekly fall, as Treasury yields rose, with investors awaiting key monthly U.S. inflation data for cues on the future of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Spot gold eased 0.2% to $1,844.78 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures eased 0.3% to $1,848.10. Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields edged up, hurting demand for zero-yield gold.   The rupee depreciated 8 paise to a record low of 77.82 against the US dollar in opening trade on Friday, tracking the strength of the greenback in the overseas market. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened on a weak note at 77.81 against the American dollar, then lost ground to quote at 77.82 -- its all-time low level, registering a fall of 8 paise from the last close. On Thursday, the rupee fell by 6 paise to close at 77.74 against the US dollar. Asian and emerging market peers have started mixed, while Asian equity remained under pressure and could weigh on sentiments, Iyer noted. Global oil benchmark Brent crude futures fell 0.66 per cent to USD 122.26 per barrel. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading 0.04 per cent lower at 103.17.   As far as immediate supports are concerned, 16350 followed by 16300 – 16260 should be seen as key levels. Traders are advised to remain positive but yes aggressive positions are not advisable till the time trend becomes strong.   India's retail inflation likely slipped modestly in May, but stayed well above the Reserve Bank of India's upper tolerance limit for a fifth consecutive month, as lower fuel prices offset surging food costs, a Reuters poll found. But the dip is expected to be temporary and analysts say the RBI remains on track to keep raising interest rates. The June 6-9 Reuters poll of 45 economists showed inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) likely slipped to 7.10% in May on a year ago, from 7.79% in April. Forecasts for the data, due on 14 June, were in a 6.70%-8.30% range.

Brent crude futures for August was down $1.01, or 0.8%, at $122.06 a barrel in early deals, after a 0.4% decline the previous day. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for July fell 98 cents, or 0.8%, to $120.53 a barrel, having dropped 0.5% on Thursday.   Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange fell 228.50 points, or 1.4%, to 16,243 in early deals on Friday, indicating a gap-down start for the Indian benchmark.

China's factory-gate inflation cooled to its slowest pace in 14 months in May, official data showed on Friday, depressed by weak demand for steel, aluminium and other key industrial commodities due to tight COVID-19 curbs. The producer price index (PPI) rose 6.4% year-on-year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement, after the 8.0% rise in April, and in line with forecasts in a Reuters poll. It was the weakest reading since March 2021. The consumer price index (CPI) gained 2.1% from a year earlier in May, in line with April's growth. In a Reuters poll, the CPI was expected to rise 2.2%. The world's second-largest economy has slowed significantly in recent months, hit by strict COVID-19 controls, disrupting supply chains and jolting production and consumption.   Stocks extended a selloff on Friday and the dollar held near a three-week high as the twin blows of high inflation and slowing economic growth stirred investor anxiety. An Asian equity gauge shed 1%, in part as Chinese tech shares slid on uncertainty over the regulatory outlook and Covid lockdowns.

Updated: 08 Jun 2022,Is down-trading a new concern for investors in paint stocks?,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/is-down-trading-a-new-concern-for-investors-in-paint-stocks-11654670740430.html,"The picture is not pretty for investors in paint stocks amid rising competition and persistently high input cost inflation. The exact impact of the former on incumbents is yet to be known. As far as the latter is concerned, companies have taken several rounds of price hikes in FY22 to contain gross margin erosion. Also, managements of top decorative paint makers have indicated price hikes in June. Consequently, with branded paints getting expensive, customers seem to be shifting back to unbranded paint products. A report by ICICI Securities Ltd. highlights that the price gap between unorganised and organised players had declined in calendar year 2021. However, with around 20% price hikes post November by large paint makers, this gap has widened again, and is likely to result in higher sales for unorganised companies, the domestic brokerage house said. Their channel checks with dealers in Maharashtra indicated down-trading. ""Some consumers paint their houses with fixed budgets. With higher paint and labour costs, they choose low priced paint. For premium paints, more labour days are required. Hence, if a consumer chooses low end paint, he saves labour cost,"" said the domestic brokerage house in a report on 7 June. An impact of this trend, if it lasts for too long, could be felt on volume growth and market share of listed paint companies. Investors would reckon market share gains from the unorganised sector has been of the key positive triggers for paint stocks. ""Our channel checks show that down-trading is also happening in the eastern part of the country. Historically, we have seen that down-trading mostly happens in the economy segment rather than premium paints. The former is lower-margin accretive. So, we don't see a significant impact on operating profit margin or volumes for incumbents, as of now. That said, postponement of decision to paint could be a bigger worry,"" said Varun Singh, analyst at IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd. Note that the managements of Berger Paints India Ltd and Kansai Nerolac Ltd had also pointed to down-trading playing out in some segments, in their earnings conference calls, post Q4FY22 results. Himanshu Nayyar, lead analyst at Yes Securities Ltd., also does not expect the current trend of down-trading in the paints sector to accelerate in a meaningful way, hereon. He feels raw material prices are close to peaking out and demand from metros and tier-I cities would remain robust given the strong growth in premium residential real estate. ""At the current juncture down-trading is happening on limited scale as current demand is coming from metros and tier-I cities, where people prefer premium products,"" he said. Simply put, down trading in paints is expected only for short-term in some pockets. Meanwhile, so far this calendar year, paint stocks have been under pressure, with shares Asian Paints Ltd and Berger correcting over 20% each. Even though the valuation multiples of these stocks have declined from their peaks, they remain expensive, said analysts."

India’s ruling party has been thrown into prompt damage control mode as the country’s diplomatic envoys faced music over the weekend from key West Asian trading partners over alleged anti-Prophet remarks by a spokesperson during a TV debate. The Bharatiya Janata Party suspended one spokesperson and expelled another on Sunday as tensions raged over social media calls for a boycott of Indian products in the Gulf region.

Tata Motors today said it has bagged an order for supply of 10,000 XPRES-T EV units from BluSmart Electric Mobility. The deployment of 10,000 units makes this the biggest ever EV fleet order in India, the auto major said in a statement.   Rating: BUY | CMP: Rs251 | TP: Rs344 We attended the analyst meet of Oil India (OINL). Management guided strong volume growth FY25E to be a watershed year, driven by commissioning of major oil and gas expansion along with Numaligarh Refinery’s (NRL) expansion projects. Some key highlights are 1) Oil and gas production to increase by 30% and 70% respectively post completion of major projects in Assam 2) NRL refinery’s expansion to 9MTPA from current 3MTPA to come on stream by FY25E 3) No imposition of windfall taxes after two years of depressed profits and 4) No price cap on gas prices. OINL is well placed to benefit from rising oil and gas prices and high GRMs and FY25E EBIDTA can increase to Rs210bn (FY22-Rs105bn) on higher volumes. We maintain our estimates and retain ‘BUY’ with a PT of Rs344 based on 3.5x EV/E FY24E.   We maintain our ADD rating with a revised target price of Rs367/unit and at CMP of Rs349/unit, we estimate NDCF yield of 5.8% in FY23E and 6.2% in FY24E (over 90% tax-free returns). Key risks to our call are further rise in vacancies across assets and fall in lease rentals.   Kolte-Patil Developers Limited (KPDL), a leading Pune-based real estate developer with expanding operations in Mumbai and Bengaluru, has partnered with India's largest EV charging solutions provider, Tata Power, to install charging stations across its projects in Pune, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, providing comprehensive charging solutions to EV owners.   Multibagger stock: Investing in penny stocks is quite risky but high risk-traders prefer to invest in such low float stocks as well. However, they invest in the penny stock after gathering proper information instead of gambling. According to market magnets, investing in stock is like investing in business. So, irrespective of size of the business, one needs to check investment viability of a stock on same parameter and if the answer coming out from the balance sheet of the company is satisfactory, then one can think of investing even in a penny stock as penny stocks deliver whopping return in short term.   Multiplex stocks were under pressure on Monday as covid cases started to rise again in India with the country reporting record weekly Covid-19 cases in three months. Shares of PVR plunged about 3% to ₹1,768 whereas that of Inox Leisure declined over 4% to ₹480 apiece on the BSE in Monday's trading session.   The Adani Group has been forging ahead, cinching around 8-10 deals in the past year. Growing organically and inorganically, the group has been investing in an array of new sectors.   Reducing ‘shock and awe’ effect of omicron wave, nuclear brinkmanship, inflation scare and rising bond yield: CY22 began with the omicron scare, followed by the sudden escalation of Russia-Ukraine conflict in Mar’22, thereby pushing the world into an unprecedented phase of nuclear brinkmanship. This impacted the ‘equity risk premium’ (reflected in spike in VIX). It also resulted in a surge in commodity prices, especially crude oil, thereby triggering an inflation scare. This was followed by the more than expected hawkishness of the US Federal Reserve and India’s RBI resulting in an increase in the ‘risk free rate’ as sovereign bond yields spiked and acted as a double whammy for equity valuations. However, post the initial spurt, omicron has receded sharply while commodity prices and bond yields have started to stabilise. Also, the Russia-Ukraine conflict will likely be scaled down from global nuclear brinkmanship to a local conflict. Dip in the latest PCE inflation data for the US, general cooling down of commodity prices and the expected increase in oil output by OPEC+ will likely add credence to the peak inflation argument. Outlook and top picks: The above trends are visible in the fear index (VIX) receding and will most likely put a floor on equity valuations on a 1-year forward P/E basis, which fell from around 23x in Oct’21 to less than 18x during the May’22 sell-off. High-frequency indicators for Q1FY23 so far appear robust and indicate economic recovery is on course. Incorporating the above factors and trends, our Mar’23E target for the NIFTY50 stands at 19,000. We are overweight on stocks driven by investment rate, savings rate, credit growth, exports and pent-up discretionary consumption. Top picks: SBI, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Aditya Birla Capital, SBI Life, Larsen & Toubro, NTPC, NHPC, GAIL, Oil India, Coal India, UltraTech Cement, Bharti Airtel, Tata Communications, Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Phoenix Mills, Brigade Enterprises, Greenpanel Industries, Indian Hotels, Jubilant Foodworks, Metro Brands, Sapphire Foods, Inox Leisure, TVS Motors, Eicher Motors.  Q1FY23 is the first quarter of no covid restriction on movement since the onset of the pandemic in 2019. High-frequency indicators for the quarter so far indicate robust economic recovery, which should gather momentum going forward.   Citi Research on Monday raised its quarterly oil price forecasts for this year and its year-average outlook for 2023, because additional supply from Iran looked heavily delayed, adding to tighter market balances. Delay in Iran sanctions relief is the main factor tightening balances, Citi said. The bank now factors in Iran sanctions relief beginning in the first quarter of next year, at first adding 0.5 million barrels per day (bpd), then 1.3 million bpd over the second half. It previously expected Iran sanctions relief to add supply in mid-2022. Iran and the United States engaged in indirect talks in Vienna over the past year to revive a 2015 nuclear agreement between Tehran and world powers. Citing tighter market balances, Citi raised its second-quarter 2022 Brent price forecast by $14 to $113 per barrel, and the third and fourth quarter prices by $12, to $99 and $85, respectively. The bank estimates Brent to average $75 per barrel in 2023, revised higher by $16.   Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, raised July crude oil prices for Asian buyers to higher-than-expected levels amid concerns about tight supply and expectations of strong demand in summer. The official selling price (OSP) for July-loading Arab Light to Asia was hiked by $2.1 a barrel from June to $6.5 a barrel over Oman/Dubai quotes, just off an all-time-high recorded in May. That was much higher than most market forecasts for an increase around $1.5. Only one respondent of six in a Reuters poll had predicted a jump of $2. ""The price jump is unexpected, especially the Arab Light. We are puzzled by the decision,"" said an Asian oil trader.   Tokyo shares shrugged off early losses to close higher on Monday as tech and export shares made gains thanks to the weaker yen. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.56 percent, or 154.32 points, to 27,915.89, while the broader Topix index added 0.31 percent, or 5.97 points, to 1,939.11. The Tokyo market came under pressure in the morning as global investors interpreted solid US economic data as a further sign the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates in its fight against inflation, driving down Wall Street shares.   Shares of Rallis India Ltd dipped nearly a per cent to ₹199 apiece on the BSE in Monday's early trading session as the stock started trading ex-dividend, a day ahead of the record date for its dividend that was announced with its Q4FY22 results in April.   Multibagger stock: Rajnish Wellness Ltd has informed Indian bourses that a meeting of board of directors of the company is scheduled to be held on 13th June 2022 to consider issuance of bonus shares and stock sub-division. The company management informed about the board agenda in its latest exchange communication. Stock market observers believe that the company might be mulling stock split after its stock price surge from ₹5.56 to 187.45 apiece levels in last one year, delivering near 3250 per cent return in this period. They said that after stellar return given by this multibagger penny stock, management might have thought that subdivision of shares would enable them increase stock volume by becoming available to small investors.   India’s sovereign bond yields breached the 7.5% level for the first time in three years as the central bank’s rate-setting panel began its three-day meeting. The benchmark 10-year yield rose as much as four basis points to 7.5%, a level last seen in 2019. Yields have jumped by more than 100 basis points in 2022 amid global tightening and as the Reserve Bank of India turned hawkish with an out-of-turn rate hike last month.   Office leasing has been on an upward trajectory, aided by an accelerated shift towards grade-A properties. This was among the key highlights of the recently held analysts' day meet of Mindspace Business Parks REIT.   Surging inflation, amplified by the Russia-Ukraine war, along with faster Fed rate hikes has triggered a hawkish pivot by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In a surprise move, RBI raised the repo rate by 40 basis points to 4.4% last month in an off-cycle hike, its first increase in borrowing rates since August 2018.   Adani Transmission share price: After ushering in the new year 2022, Adani Transmission shares gave stellar return to its shareholders till beginning of May 2022. However, from first week of May 2022, this Adani group stock has been under sell-off heat. According to stock market experts, massive sell-off by FIIs, stock trading at much higher valuations and negative sentiments in the secondary markets are the major reasons for Adani Transmission share price tumble. They also said that the stock may continue to remain under consolidation till next big trigger arrived for the stock.   TVS Motor Co.

Varun Beverages shares were trading nearly a per cent lower at ₹726 apiece on the BSE in opening deals.   Benchmark indices continued to fall on Monday, with the Sensex declining 227 points in early trade as investors remained cautious amid unabated selling by foreign funds and elevated crude oil prices. The 30-share BSE Sensex was trading 226.7 points lower at 55,542.53 points. The broader NSE Nifty fell by 67.05 points to 16,517.25 points. From the Sensex pack, Tech Mahindra, Asian Paints, Wipro, Hindustan Unilever Limited, Bajaj Finserv, Infosys, Tata Steel and Titan were the biggest laggards. In contrast, M&M and Axis Bank were the gainers. Elsewhere in Asia, markets in Tokyo, Shanghai and Hong Kong were trading in the green. Stock markets in the US had ended lower on Friday.   The rupee appreciated 4 paise to 77.62 against the US dollar in opening trade on Monday, supported by a weak American currency in the overseas markets. However, muted domestic equities, elevated crude oil prices and persistent foreign fund outflows restricted the rupee's rise, forex traders said. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened slightly strong at 77.65 against the American dollar and gained further momentum to quote 77.62, registering a rise of 4 paise from the last close. In the previous session, the rupee had settled at 77.66 against the US dollar. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading 0.04 per cent lower at 102.10. Global oil benchmark Brent crude futures rose 0.79 per cent to USD 120.66 per barrel.   Gold prices were steady on Monday, after dropping about 1% in the previous session, following a robust U.S. jobs report that signalled more interest rate increases this year, weighing on non-yielding bullion. Spot gold was flat at $1,850.60 per ounce, as of 0041 GMT, while U.S. gold futures were up 0.2% at $1,853.60.    Asian markets were mixed Monday following a steep drop on Wall Street in response to a forecast-topping US jobs report that gave the Federal Reserve room to continue hiking interest rates as it struggles to contain surging inflation. US traders took flight after the closely watched non-farm payroll figures Friday, which showed a slowdown in hiring but still with more new posts created than expected. That came as more officials suggested the Federal Reserve could continue lifting borrowing costs sharply as they try to rein in inflation. However, with prices being driven higher by factors ranging from the Ukraine war to China's lockdown-induced slowdown, there are fears the bank's measures could deal a blow to the world's biggest economy.   Cryptocurrency prices today gained with Bitcoin above the $30,000 level around which it has been trading for the past month. The world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency rose more than 4% and was trading at $30,878.

In last 5 sessions, this beaten-down Rakesh Jhunjhunwala stock has surged from ₹235.10 apiece levels to ₹259.35 per share mark, logging near 10 per cent rise in last one week. Uptrend in this Va Tech Wabag share price may continue as the water treatment company has recently bagger first large-scale seawater desalination plant in Senegal and the largest in West Africa upon completion.   IT major Infosys' shares have fallen 22% from its highs on the back of weak Q4 results due to margin pressures, as well as growing concerns on growth due to worsening macro and rising yields.   Multibagger stock: Global financial services group Nomura Singapore Limited ODI has bought stake in Veeram Securities Ltd. The financial firm, which has presence across 30 countries has bought 1,50,000 Veeram Securities shares. Likewise, Resonance Opportunities Fund Mauritius has made an investment of 1,03,000 shares in this BSE-listed share, which is one of the multibagger penny stock that has risen to the tune of 120% in last one year.   6 stocks to buy or sell today — 6th June   The Reserve Bank's rate-setting panel will begin its three-day deliberations on Monday to decide the next monetary policy in the backdrop of high inflationary concerns and evolving geo-political situation. Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das headed six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is scheduled to announce the policy resolution on Wednesday,8 June.   The price of wheat has jumped in the international markets after India announced a ban on the export of the staple cereal and due to the reduced production prospects in Ukraine following the Russian invasion, the UN food agency has said. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Price Index averaged 157.4 points in May 2022, down 0.6 per cent from April. The index, which tracks monthly changes in the international prices of a basket of commonly-traded food commodities, however, remained 22.8 per cent higher than in May 2021. The FAO Cereal Price Index averaged 173.4 points in May, up 3.7 points (2.2 per cent) from April and as much as 39.7 points (29.7 per cent) above its May 2021 value.   Monetary policy tightening measures along with rising subsidies imply that the consolidated fiscal deficit may remain elevated at 10.2% of GDP in FY23, down 20bps from FY22. The government has pegged the combined fiscal shortfall at 9.8%, of which the central deficit is seen at 6.4% and states’ at 3.4% for FY23. While these measures may help to soften the inflationary pressures by ~50bps over the coming months, that will not be enough to bring inflation within the RBI’s comfort zone of 2-6%, unless global commodity prices moderate significantly. India’s merchandise exports rose by 15.5% to $37.29 bn in May’22, on account of a healthy performance by sectors like Petroleum Products, Electronic Goods and Chemicals. However, the trade deficit widened to US$23.33bn in May’22, while imports during the month grew by 56.14% to $60.62 bn.   FII selling increased to ₹400 bn in May’22, post the ₹171 bn in Apr’22; FII selling was witnessed for the 8th consecutive month in a row. They sold more than Rs2,000bn in the last 8 months, while DIIs bought shares worth Rs508bn in May’22. Ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, higher commodity prices, elevated inflation and increased expectations of aggressive Fed rate hike in the US kept the Dollar Index at 101 levels. However, we expect sustained FII inflows to resume in 2HFY23 and continue in FY23, as India is better placed compared to many other economies.   The Japanese yen was on the back foot on Monday, ahead of a busy policy-focused week in which inflation will be in the spotlight with a major European Central Bank meeting and U.S. consumer price data scheduled. The dollar climbed to 130.99 yen in early trade, a fresh one-month high, and not far from last month's 20-year peak of 131.34, after gaining 2.95% last week. The euro has also climbed on the Japanese currency and hit 140.38 yen on Monday morning, extending a seven-year high hit last week. Barclays analysts attributed last week's softer yen to a recovery in risk assets, a rise in overseas yields, a stronger dollar and higher oil prices causing concerns about Japan's balance of trade. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major peers, was at 102.1 after gaining 0.47% last week after good jobs and manufacturing data.   The worst is still to come for the Indian rupee after its slide in May to a historic low, according to analysts and forward markets. The currency may drop to between 79 to 81 per dollar over the next few months, according to analysts from UBS AG to Nomura Holdings Inc. and Bloomberg Economics. Forwards are also pricing in a similar weakness for the rupee. The bearish forecasts -- which will see the rupee drop as much as 4% from current level -- stem from a deterioration in India’s external finances. Higher oil prices threaten to widen the current-account deficit to at least 3% of the gross domestic product, compared to a 2% sustainable level, according to UBS, even as outflows from its equity markets accelerate. “A grind higher for USD/INR from here toward 80 in the next couple of months is not a big ask,"" said Rohit Arora, emerging markets Asia strategist at UBS. “Nor do I think 80 is a runaway depreciation by any metric. It’s a very modest adjustment of a currency with deteriorating fundamentals."" The rupee declined about 1.6% in May, the biggest drop among emerging Asian currencies, spurring Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das to say that the central bank won’t allow a runaway depreciation of the currency. The current account deficit can still be comfortably funded this year, he added.   Oil prices rose more than $2 in early trade on Monday after Saudi Arabia raised prices sharply for its crude sales in July, an indicator of how tight supply is even after OPEC+ agreed to accelerate its output increases over the next two months. Brent crude futures were up $1.80, or 1.5%, at $121.52 a barrel at 2319 GMT after touching an intraday high of $121.95, extending a 1.8% gain from Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up $1.63, or 1.4%, at $120.50 a barrel after hitting a three-month high of $120.99. The contract gained 1.7% on Friday. Saudi Arabia raised the official selling price (OSP) for its flagship Arab light crude to Asia to a $6.50 premium versus the average of the Oman and Dubai benchmarks, up from a premium of $4.40 in June, state oil produce Aramco said on Sunday.   Asian shares made a muted start on Monday as caution gripped ahead of a critical reading on U.S. inflation, while the euro gained on the yen amid wagers the European Central Bank will take a major step toward policy tightening this week. Oil prices jumped in early trade after Saudi Arabia raised prices sharply for its crude sales in July, an indicator of how tight supply is even after OPEC+ agreed to accelerate its output increases over the next two months. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.1%, while Japan's Nikkei eased 0.3%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures both edged up 0.1%. Markets will be on tenterhooks for the U.S. consumer price report on Friday, especially after EU inflation shocked many with a record high last week. Forecasts are for a steep rise of 0.7% in May, though the annual pace is seen holding at 8.3% while core inflation is seen slowing a little to 5.9%. A high number would only add to expectations of aggressive tightening by the Federal Reserve with markets already priced for half-point hikes in June and July and almost 200 basis points by the end of the year.

Asian Paints share price today opened with downside gap and hit intraday low of ₹2740.50 levels whereas Berger Paints share price today opened lower and hit intraday low of ₹547 apiece levels. In last two sessions, Berger Paints shares have fallen from ₹610.50 to ₹547 levels, logging more than 10 per cent dip whereas Asian Paints share price has fallen from ₹3096 to ₹2740.50 levels, descending to the tune of 11.50 per cent in last two sessions. According to stock market experts, paint stocks are correcting because Aditya Birla Group firm Grasim Industries has doubled the capex for its foray into the paints business to ₹10,000 crore and expects to start production from the fourth quarter of 2023-24. In August 2021, company board had approved ₹5,000 crore for foraying into the paint manufacturing business. Market experts said that paint stocks are expected to remain under the sell-off heat and advised positional investors to avoid taking any fresh position in the counter. Speaking on the reason for dip in stock price of paint majors, Ravi Singhal, Vice Chairman at GCL Securities said, “Aditya Birla group company Grasim Industries has announced to foray into paint business and it has doubled its capex for paints business as well. The company has also announced that it is expecting to start paint production from Q4FY24."" He said that paint stocks are already under pressure due to spike in crude oil prices after Russia-Ukraine war. Expecting sell-off in Asian Paints and Berger Paints to further continue, Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking said, ""Both paint stocks are looking weak on chart pattern and there can be some more sell-off expected in these paint stocks. Asian Paints share price may go up to ₹2550 per share levels whereas Berger Paints may go down up to ₹480 per share levels."" ""At least 10 per cent further correction in both Asian Paints and Berger Paints shares are expected from current levels,"" said Ravi Singhal of GCL Securities. Grasim Industries is setting up five to six plants. The civil construction has already commenced at two of its plant sites -- Panipat and Ludhiana -- and is expected to start shortly at Chamarajanagar, in Karnataka.

The company will incur capital expenditure of ₹10,000 crore by FY25, which is twice the initial investment announced in 2021. Clearly, the competitive intensity in the Indian paints industry is heating up. In reaction, shares of Asian Paints Ltd and Berger Paints India Ltd fell by 7-8% on NSE on Wednesday. Grasim has also accelerated the execution of its paints capacity of 1,332 million litres per annum (mlpa) with the commissioning of plants to start by Q4FY24. This compares with around 1,750 mlpa capacity for Asian Paints but is much higher than that of Berger and Kansai Nerolac India Ltd. Asian Paints is now the market leader in the decorative paints segment, followed by Berger. Grasim aims to become the number two decorative paints company over a period of time.       "

In August last year, Grasim Industries' board had approved a ₹5,000 crore capital expenditure (CAPEX) plan to set up a paints business. The planned capex in the Paints business has been raised to INR100b from INR50b earlier and the installed capacity will be 1.33m kl. The rise in capex is due to higher capacities and cost inflation. Production is likely to commence from 4QFY24E. The management targets an IRR of 20% from this business,"" Motilal Oswal said in a note. Asian Paints shares today ended 8% lower at ₹2,839. Another paint manufacturer Berger Paints tumbled 7% to ₹568.80. Grasim Industries is setting up five to six plants. The civil construction has already commenced at two of its plant sites -- Panipat and Ludhiana -- and is expected to start shortly at Chamarajanagar, in Karnataka. Paints stocks have been under pressure, in line with broader markets, due to a rise in oil prices which puts pressure on paint manufacturer's margins.  ""A fall in margins due to the rise in oil prices has spoiled the investor’s sentiment in the market. In FY22, paint companies have already taken a price hike of 20% due to inflationary pressure on raw material costs. Further, Asian Paint took a 2% price hike from April- May 22 and expects more price hikes in Q1FY23. We expect the demand trend may have an impact in the near term on account of a steep rise in prices,"" said Antu Thomas, Senior Research Analyst at Geojit Financial Services."

Note that this is double of its ₹5,000 crore investment plan to set up its paints business, which was announced last year. Clearly, the competitive intensity in the once oligopolistic Indian paints sector is heating up, raising concerns of buisness disruption for incumbents Asian Paints Ltd. and Berger Paints India Ltd. Reacting to this development, shares of both these companies declined around 3% each on the National Stock Exchange in opening deals on Wednesday. Asian Paints is the market leader in the decorative paints segment, followed by Berger. Grasim has also accelerated the execution of its paint's capacity of 1,332 million litres per annum with the commissioning of plants to start by Q4FY24. It aims to become the number two decorative paints company over a period of time. Analysts note that this compares with 1,700 mlpa for Asian Pants and is much higher than Berger and Kansai Nerolac India Ltd. To be sure, the paints industry has high entry barriers and history shows that not many new comers have tasted huge success here. Scalability is among the key challenges that new companies in this sector have often faced, said analysts. For instance, international paint companies Nippo and Jotun. Even so, Grasim pumping in more funds, does come as a sentiment dampener for existing companies. ""We believe the threat from new competitors is higher than in the past, as the new entrants are domestic players that possess an understanding of the Indian commodity industry and have strong balance sheets and the drive to grow to be among the top players,"" analysts at Morgan Stanley India Company Pvt. Ltd said in a report on 24 May. Concurring, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd said, Grasim may go for an aggressive strategy (pricing or otherwise) and disturb the market structure which may have a greater impact on smaller players, but Asian Paints may also be at risk. ""This is reminiscent of Jio's foray into the telecom industry, with significant capacity additions, which ultimately resulted in lower industry tariffs,"" said the Jefferies report dated 24 May.  "

In a post-earnings call, the management said, in FY22, it saw around 32-34% inflation and took price increases in the range of around 24-25% Further, the incremental inflation in Q1FY23 is 5-7% and price increases of about 2% would be effective in May and June. In simple terms, this means, that gross margins would take time to fully recover inspite of price hikes. ""While gross margin pressure has been receding, courtesy price hikes. We suspect future price hikes are likely to lag raw material inflation, as demand elasticity from hereon may get tested,"" analysts at HDFC Securities Ltd said in a report on 10 May. Further, the company's management highlighted that even after recovery, gross margin may return to 41-42% levels as compared to the 43-44% seen in a deflationary raw material cycle. Also, the management does not intend to take steep price hikes given the competition in the sector. Analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd caution that amid elevated inflation and likely increase in competitive pressure, Asian Paints may find it difficult to achieve 22-24% Ebitda margin in the near-medium term. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. In Q4FY22, consolidated operating margin at 18.1%, rose 19bps sequentially, but fell 154bps year-on-year (y-o-y). Note that Aditya Birla Group company Grasim Industries Ltd announced its foray into the paints segment in early 2021 and it's entry into the market is expected in the second half of calendar 2022. Meanwhile, Asian Paints' domestic decorative business registered 8% y-o-y volume growth on a high base and value growth was at 21% y-o-y in 4QFY22. The company saw good volume growth in February and March, however volumes fell in January impacted by the Omicron variant. In FY22, the company saw 31% volume growth and value growth of 36%, y-o-y. So, analysts point out that some of its product categories seem to have witnessed down-trading in smaller cities and towns. In this backdrop, Asian Paints' rich valuations are little comforting. ""Despite modest earnings growth for five years in succession and declining return on capital employed, valuations at 66x/57x FY23E/FY24E earnings per share seem high versus the five/ten/fifteen-year average of 56x/47x/39x,"" domestic brokerage house Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a report on 10 May."

The reduction in profit was also due to ₹53.73 crore exceptional loss from subsidy delay by state governments and ₹48 crore loss from Sri Lanka business.

On Tuesday, Asian Paints shares were up nearly 3% in noon deals at ₹3,090.85 apiece on NSE. “It was yet another quarter of solid and strong double digit value growth across all businesses, despite the prevailing uncertainty around Covid, macro-economic challenges and heightened geo-political tensions. The domestic Decorative business grew strongly, registering 8% volume growth and 20% plus revenue growth on a high base,"" said Asian Paints MD and CEO Amit Syngle. ""The international business managed to deliver a double-digit revenue growth for the quarter despite severe challenges in key markets. The Industrial Coatings business closed the quarter with another round of robust double digit revenue growth with continued momentum in the protective coatings segment. The scale-up in the Home Décor business continued unhindered, making further inroads through network expansion and introduction of unique value propositions for its customers. We continued to improve our operating margins on a sequential basis which was a result of some calibrated price increases, driving the premium and luxury product growths, coupled with some strong work on driving operational efficiencies across businesses. As an organization, we continue to work diligently on expanding our capabilities to beautify, preserve, transform all spaces and objects and in that course deliver sustained value to all our stakeholders,"" he said."

The decline came after five quarters of positive volume growth, with demand for packaged goods dipping sharply in India’s villages, according to industry data released by NielsenIQ. Rising inflation led to three consecutive quarters of double-digit price increases, resulting in consumption slowdown in urban markets and consumption de-growth in rural markets, the market researcher said in its Q4 2021 FMCG Snapshot released on Wednesday. A more “accentuated"" slowdown was reported in rural markets, with volumes down 4.8% during the quarter under review.

Tyagi, who left as the chief of the regulator after a five-year term, said other law enforcement agencies are also looking into the matter. ""Till now, all the facts and findings in the public domain are based on Sebi's findings disclosed in its orders, and we should wait for the investigation of other agencies as well,"" Tyagi said. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is cooperating with other agencies and sharing the information sought with them, he added.

""We came out with orders within our remit and understanding,"" he said, stressing that no one can say that the regulator ""diluted"" the orders. The comments from the chief come a fortnight after an order, which led to a furore, as the then NSE chief was seen as taking orders from a mystic Yogi residing in the Himalayas to run the largest stock exchange. Tyagi said the recent order was delayed, mentioning that there was the COVID pandemic in between. He, however, added that the delay was not intentional.

Petrol and diesel price hikes are likely to resume after state elections get over next week to bridge the ₹9 a litre gap created by international oil prices soaring past USD 100 a barrel. International crude oil prices shot above USD 110 a barrel for the first time since mid-2014 on fears that oil and gas supplies from energy giant Russia could be disrupted, either by the conflict in Ukraine or retaliatory western sanctions. The basket of crude oil India buys rose above USD 102 per barrel on March 1, the highest since August 2014, according to information from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the oil ministry. This compares to an average of USD 81.5 per barrel price of the Indian basket of crude oil at the time of freezing of petrol and diesel prices in early November last year. ""With state elections getting over next week, we expect daily fuel price hikes to restart across both gasoline and diesel,"" JP Morgan said in a report. The seventh and final phase of polling for the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly is on February 7 and the counting of votes slated for March 10. State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) are making a loss of ₹5.7 a litre on petrol and diesel. This is without taking into account their normal margin of ₹2.5 per litre. The brokerage said for oil marketing companies to revert to normalised marketing margins, retail prices need to increase by ₹9 a litre or 10 per cent.   As the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia drive a relentless surge in oil prices, equities in India and South Korea are looking more vulnerable. With Brent crude crossing $110 a barrel, that clouds the outlook for two of Asia’s larger oil importers -- which are also home to the region’s worst-performing currencies this year. While stocks in Mumbai and Seoul have already taken hits from concerns over Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes and a related technology selloff, analysts see both as more susceptible to risk-off sentiment. Rising costs could squeeze companies’ profits at a time Asia’s earnings growth is lagging global peers. Higher oil prices “are particularly negative for India, Korea and Taiwan, which are large oil importers,"" Morgan Stanley strategists including Jonathan Garner wrote in a note.

In case of price hike in Apr’22, there will be again inventory uploading in Mar’22, (3) while paint prices are up 22% YoY, labour rates are up 10% YoY which indicates ~14% inflation for consumers, (4) same price for all colours offer of JSW Paints is well accepted by consumers. Generally dark shades cost more than light shades; red and orange colours are more expensive than blue and green and (5) dealers are hopeful of demand revival in Q1FY23 due to favourable base of Q1FY22 which was impacted by covid wave II. Our neutral stance on paint industry (and stocks) is intact - a function of our inability and unwillingness to subscribe to BAAP (buy at any price) as believed by some market participants.   The country's largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India reported a marginal drop in total wholesales at 1,64,056 units in February. The company had sold 1,64,469 units in February 2021. Last month, the company's domestic sales slipped 8.46% on year to 1,40,035 units, it added.   Indian bond yields edged higher while the rupee weakened on Wednesday, tracking a sharp rise in global crude oil prices that threatens to push up domestic inflation and widen the country's current account deficit. Oil prices rose as sanctions on Russian banks following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine hampered trade finance for crude shipments and some traders opted to avoid Russian supplies in an already tight market.  The benchmark 10-year bond yield edged up to 6.80%, up 3 basis points from its previous close on Monday. It touched 6.81% in early trade, the highest since Feb. 9. Markets were closed on Tuesday for a local holiday. Traders said if there are no more debt sales in this fiscal year, yields are likely to trade in a 6.75% to 6.85% range depending on the movement in global crude and the evolving geopolitical situation. India imports more than two-thirds of its oil requirements and rising crude will push up imported inflation while also widening the country's current account deficit. The partially convertible rupee was trading at 75.63/64 per dollar, weaker compared to its previous close of 75.34. It dropped to a low of 75.7725, its weakest since Dec. 20.   Asian equities suffered a second successive month of outflows in February as investors jettisoned riskier assets due to rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine and on fears of aggressive monetary tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve this year. According to Refinitiv data, cross-border investors sold Asian equities worth a net $6.9 billion in South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and India in the last month, after disposing $8.4 billion in January. Indian equities faced its fifth consecutive outflow in February, as foreigners dumped $4.74 billion worth of the country's stocks last month. Analysts said rising crude oil prices remain a big threat to the country's economic recovery, as India is one of the biggest oil importers in the world.   Tata Steel will set up a 'world class' facility to produce medical material. According to a stock exchange filing, Tata Steel Advanced Materials (TSAML), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, has invested in a bio-ceramics startup, Ceramat Private Limited. TSAML has executed a Share Purchase cum Shareholders’ Agreement for acquisition of a 90% equity stake in Ceramat Private Limited.   India's factory activity growth accelerated in February as the threat from a third COVID-19 wave eased, while some softening of price pressures meant demand and business expectations strengthened, a private survey showed. However, the survey was conducted before Russia invaded Ukraine, which led to an immediate spike in oil prices. India is the world's third-largest importer of oil so the crisis will add to inflationary pressure and hurt consumer sentiment. The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by IHS Markit from Feb. 10-22, improved to 54.9 in February from 54.0 in January. February's reading exceeded expectations for 54.3 in a Reuters poll and was above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction for an eighth month. ""For now, India's manufacturing sector has weathered the storm of the Omicron variant, undoubtedly supported by the relatively high inoculation rate,"" noted Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit.   Markets technical outlook On Monday, Nifty entirely recouped initial losses seen after a gap-down opening (16658-16482) and closed near day's high. As a result, daily price action formed a sizable bull candle with small lower shadow, highlighting elevated buying demand that emerged from 52 weeks EMA placed around 16400 As per change of polarity concept earlier support of 16800 is now acting as an immediate resistance for the Nifty over past three sessions. Going ahead, only a decisive close above 16800 along with cool off in VIX and crude oil prices will add fuel to the ongoing pullback rally towards 17200 as it is the 61.8% retracement of February decline (17795-16203), placed at 17186.  Meanwhile, Monday’s low will be the key monitorable in coming sessions as breach below Monday’s low of 16356 on a closing basis would lead to extended correction towards 16200   In a post-Covid world, conscious investing has gained lot of traction among investors. In fact, in 2021, at a global platform, India made a commitment to reach net carbon zero by 2070. With the environment, social and governance (ESG) theme fast catching-up, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd have outlined key considerations for investors and picked stocks from five sectors to bet on this theme.  (Read on)   Exports fell 3% on year to 2.03 lakh units in February, while two-wheeler sales declined 16% to 2.79. Three-wheeler sales slipped 14% to 36,683 units last month.   Gold prices declined, but remained near a 13-month high on fears that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could turn more brutal, aiding demand for haven assets as investors weigh the potential fallout and sanctions.  Spot gold retreated 0.5% to $1,935.58 an ounce on Wednesday, after rising 1.9% on Tuesday and 6.2% in February.   Financial transactions of Indian banks with Russian lenders have come to an abrupt halt after the expulsion of some Russian banks from the Swift international financial messaging network, two bankers said. Most international transactions are settled in dollars and involve US banks, which cannot transact with Russian entities. Enforced by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) through its list of sanctioned entities, the Swift sanctions essentially mean banks cannot initiate transactions involving lenders or entities on the list. Indian banks are hoping the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will work out an alternative payment mechanism as was done when Iran sanctions were imposed in 2012 and again in 2018. “We cannot unilaterally decide to stop payments because of the sanctions. However, following the sanctions, US banks cannot execute these transactions. We are hoping that later this week, there will be some decision by the government since Russia is an important trade partner,"" said one of the two bankers cited above, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity. (Read here)   Wall Street’s biggest banks are sticking by their calls for as many as seven Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes this year even as traders and some of their peers ratchet back expectations. Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. still predict the U.S. central bank will raise its benchmark to 2% by year-end from the current range of zero to 0.25%, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. sees the rate reaching 2% in early 2023. Their main argument: surging inflation will compel the Fed to act. Sure the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions weighing on the country may curb global growth, but they will also fuel further consumer-prices gains by pushing up raw material prices even more. “The underlying rationale for normalization hasn’t yet changed,"" said Praveen Korapathy, a strategist at Goldman Sachs in New York. “If all we get is a small hit to growth and still elevated inflation, it makes the Fed’s trade-off worse, but I don’t think it would get them to sit on their hands."" Rates traders see things differently. They have slashed the odds of Fed tightening in recent days as the sanctions on Russia have weighed on the global-growth outlook. Money markets have pared pricing for a rate hike in March to a quarter point from a half-point prior to the invasion, and they now predict the central bank’s key rate will peak at 1.7%, well below the Fed’s long-term estimate of 2.5%. TD Securities Inc. is among those revising its view. The company now sees a smaller Fed hike this month than it earlier envisaged, and it’s shifting some of its anticipated rate increases to next year.   Central Depository Services (India) Limited (CDSL), the only listed depository in India, said it has achieved the milestone of opening 6 crore active demat accounts. At an event organised on this occasion, Ananta Barua, whole-time member of Securities and Exchange Board of India, highlighted the importance of investor awareness. “Dematerialisation was a product of the difficulties caused on account of physical shares. Access to the Indian securities market has become safe, convenient and easy and the new milestone is a representation of the same…the markets were reaching unprecedented new heights and that was possible only due to the ease of business being provided by the MIIs such as eCAS, eNomination, etc. which helped the capacity building of the investors and the whole financials system was benefitted,"" he said   Passenger and commercial vehicle wholesale dispatches picked up in February, with most manufacturers reporting an improvement in semiconductor supplies and healthy domestic and export demand. Wholesale dispatches for two-wheelers and tractors, however, were lower due to muted domestic demand and a high base of last year. Maruti Suzuki’s passenger vehicle sales were marginally lower at 164,056 units last month from 164,469 units in February 2021. But, while domestic sales were impacted by chip shortages, the automaker more than doubled its share of exports in February to 24,021 units. Hyundai’s passenger vehicle sales fell 14% to 53,159 units, and exports declined 10%. Tata Motors and Mahindra and Mahindra, however, recorded double-digit growth in passenger car dispatches in February, with sales up by 47% and 80%, respectively, led by high demand for SUVs. (Read here)   The U.S. and other major economies have agreed on a coordinated release of oil stockpiles after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pushed crude above $100 a barrel. The International Energy Agency, which represents key industrialized consumers, will deploy 60 million barrels from stockpiles around the world. Half of that amount will come from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, with the rest from IEA members in Europe and Asia. The IEA said it will continue to monitor energy markets and could recommend additional stockpile releases if need. A release of 60 million barrels, while significant, only equates to less than two-thirds of global daily consumption of around 100 million barrels. The international release late last year included 50 million barrels from the U.S. but only relatively small contributions from other countries. While oil prices fell in the run-up, they actually rose when it was officially announced in late November.   Tata Sons Ltd is faced with a fresh crisis at Air India Ltd, with the airline’s newly appointed chief executive turning down the role before even taking charge. Ilker Ayci, former chairman of Turkish Airlines, cited political controversies, in a statement, for declining the assignment. His decision leaves the new owner of Air India with the fresh challenge of hunting for a new leader of the recently privatized airline. Known as a turnaround expert, Ayci’s appointment, announced soon after Tata Sons took over Air India in January, sparked hopes of fast recovery of the airline grappling with an ageing aircraft fleet, mounting debt and several legacy issues arising from its workers’ unions. But just a fortnight into his appointment, Ayci declined to take up the role on Tuesday. His decision may hurt Tata’s ambition to quickly turn around Air India’s fortunes and help the company regain the market share it ceded to rivals.

(Read here)   Brent crude broke above $110 a barrel on Wednesday and WTI surged more than 5% as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continued to fan fears over supplies of the crucial commodity from the resource-rich region. Brent climbed 4.88% to $110.09, while WTI was up 5.06% at 108.64. Both are at more than seven-year highs. Vladimir Putin's incursion into the neighbouring country has seen world powers impose strict, far-reaching sanctions on Moscow in retaliation, fuelling worries that exports from Russia will be cut off. Russia is the world's third-biggest oil producer. The conflict in eastern Europe came as prices were already soaring owing to tight supplies and a strong recovery in demand around the world as economies reopen from pandemic-induced lockdowns.   Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange were at 16,545.50, down 162.50 points, 0.97%, in early deals on Wednesday, signalling at a lower start for Indian benchmarks.   Most Asian stocks fell Wednesday as the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia stoke the cost of commodities including oil, hurting the outlook for economic growth and supporting demand for sovereign bonds. Shares retreated in Japan, China and Hong Kong, where a four-day lockdown looms amid a Covid testing blitz. U.S. contracts steadied after Wall Street shares retreated on the prospect of slowing growth alongside high inflation. Oil scaled $107 a barrel as steps to tap reserves failed to ease worries over supplies as penalties mount on resource-rich Russia for invading its neighbor. An index of commodities jumped the most since 2009 to a record. The conflict is a threat to flows of energy, crops and metals, which were already tight. Japan’s Topix index slid 1.6%, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.2%, South Korea’s Kospi index was flat, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 0.6%, and China’s Shanghai Composite index decreased 0.6%. Overnight on the Wall Street, stocks fell as soaring oil prices raised more concerns about how Russia's escalating war on Ukraine may impact the global economy. Nervous investors again poured money into ultra-safe U.S. government bonds.  The S&P 500 index fell 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.8% and the Nasdaq composite slid 1.6%. The declines add to the market's losses after a two-month skid to start the year.  "

Updated: 16 Feb 2022,Paint margins are peeling but price hikes may help,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/paint-companies-to-get-gloss-back-after-a-pallid-q3-11644947626181.html,"It has been a somewhat gloomy earnings season for paint manufacturers. Sky-high raw material prices have understandably taken the sheen off profit margins. Gross margins of top listed paint companies have contracted by 631-832 basis points (bps) for the December quarter (Q3FY22). One basis point is 0.01%. Needless to say, this has become a sore point for investors. Nevertheless, to combat cost pressures, all companies took price hikes, helping the margin outlook. “Top paint makers have taken aggregate price hikes of 21-24% in the decorative coating business during the year-to-date FY22. This is likely to improve gross margins by 80-100bps sequentially in Q4FY22,"" said Varun Singh, analyst at IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd.        "

Updated: 21 Jan 2022,"For Asian Paints, worst of inflation over but a worry is emerging elsewhere",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/for-asian-paints-worst-of-inflation-over-but-a-worry-is-emerging-elsewhere-11642753942098.html,"With steep price hikes, Asian Paints Ltd is gradually winning the cost inflation battle. In a conference call with analysts post the December quarter earnings, the management said, in nine months of FY22, the company took a cumulative price hike of around 22% in response to nearly 25% raw material inflation.  The management added that the decorative paints industry took two rounds of price increases post the festive season, with 9-10% blended price hike from 12 November, and 4-5% additional price increase from 5 December. On a consolidated basis, gross margins improved by 200 basis points (bps) sequentially in Q3FY22 to 36.8%, although compared to the same quarter last year, margins are down by 830bps. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.  The management expects the impact of price hikes to start reflecting on earnings from the March quarter, which is expected to translate into full recovery on gross margins on a sequential basis. So, analysts feel that worries on inflation may soon be a thing of the past for the company. “Asian Paints’ performance (including the ramp-up in adjacencies) remains the most impressive among the top-three players; the recent round of price hikes means the worst of margin pressure is likely over,"" analysts at HDFC Securities Ltd said in a report. Going ahead, the focus would shift back to demand growth. Asian Paints reported better-than-expected volume growth in the December quarter, in spite of the price increases. Its decorative paints business saw volumes rise 18% year-on-year (y-o-y). On a three-year and two-year CAGR basis, decorative paints volume growth was at 20% and 25%, respectively, the management said. CAGR is short for compounded annual growth rate. The company witnessed broad-based growth across markets with metros and tier-I and tier-II cities outperforming tier III and IV towns, the management said. Further, in Q3 the company did not witness any signs of weakness in rural demand, the management said. Even so, analysts say, investors should closely watch rural demand trajectory. ""Demand growth would be the key monitorable here. Given how the outlook on rural growth in consumer staples turned negative all of a sudden in recent months, we reckon the hyper-growth phase for Paints also isn’t going to last forever,"" analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said in a report.

Bajaj Auto Ltd will announce its December quarter (Q3FY22) results today. Last quarter, the company’s volumes shrank by nearly 10% year-on-year. This was primarily driven by a 12% fall in two-wheeler (2W) sales, which was partly offset by an 18% growth in total three-wheeler sales (3W). Even so, strong exports and price hikes are expected to support marginal year-on-year revenue growth in Q3. Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects Bajaj Auto’s Q3 revenues to rise by 1% year on year. However, the drop in sales volume and higher commodity costs have kept expectations low on the Ebitda margin front. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization; a key measure of profitability. Motilal Oswal estimates Bajaj Auto’s Ebitda margin to contract by 510 basis points (bps) year-on-year to 14.3%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened at 74.36 against the American currency and witnessed an intra-day low of 74.60 during the session. The rupee finally settled at 74.58, down 33 paise over its previous close of 74.25 against the greenback.   6 stocks to buy or sell today - 19th January.   Nervousness across globe triggers sharp profit booking Our markets started the session slightly in the green but right from the beginning the benchmark index looked a bit tentative. In the initial hour, Nifty tested sub-18200 levels from where the banking space took the charge and lifted markets higher to trim all losses. But market was not done with its action yet. As we stepped into the penultimate hour, the global markets became extremly nervous which resulted in a sharp decline to test 18100 at the close. Today for the major part of the session, Nifty remained under pressure but banking was on a roll; but eventually it succumbed to the last hour sell off. This weighed down heavily on the overall sentiments as some of the stocks tumbled like a bottomless pit. Index wise, we lost slightly over a percent but the velocity at which market came off, it was intimidating. Also in last 4 – 5 days, index had done nothing but stock specific movement was quite enough to keep the traders engrossed all the time. Today it was the individual stocks who went under a hammer and hence, was certainly not a pleasant day for traders. Despite today’s correction, we are not seeing any structural damage yet, rather it should be considered as a profit booking after recent relentless run. As far as levels are concerned, 18000 followed by 17900 to be treated as key supports and if today’s decline was merely a profit booking, market should attract some buying interest around mentioned supports. On the flipside since the volatility has increased a bit, the resistance remains slightly higher at 18250 – 18350.   Most Asian stocks fell Wednesday following a Wall Street selloff in the wake of a surge in Treasury yields, as the prospect of Federal Reserve monetary tightening to fight high inflation weighs on markets.

U.S. futures wavered after the S&P 500 suffered a broad drop and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 sank 2.6%. The slide in Treasuries is stirring expectations that the benchmark 10-year yield will top 2%.  "

The pre-budget move has started in many pockets and that is likely to continue in next week as well. Global markets are showing some volatility that will have some impact on our market as well. Covid cases are rising but the market is complacent about Covid cases as the hospitalization and mortality rate is low. The market is likely to remain volatile ahead of new all-time high amid Q3 earnings, global cues, and pre budget expectations. If we look at the trend of last three years then market starts to correct between 15-20th January then we see a big post-budget rally in the market. It will be interesting to see how the market will approach Budget 2022. If we look at the data then FIIs' long exposure in the index future stands at 66% while the put-call ratio is sitting at 1.25 level that is neutral to positive for the market.

Technically, the market is in strong bullish momentum where 18300-18350 is a minor resistance area; above this Nifty is likely to head towards a fresh all-time high. On the downside, 18050-17950 is an immediate demand zone while 17800/17650 is major support levels. Bank Nifty is facing some resistance at 61.8% retracement of the previous fall from the high of 41829 to the low of 34018 however overall structure is bullish and if it manages to take out 38900-39100 resistance zone then we can expect a rally towards 40000/40500 levels. On the downside, 38000 is an immediate support level while 37500/37000 is the next support levels. "

(PTI)   The market is showing a typical behavior which generally happens after a decent rally and if any major event is close by. Both these conditions meet here as we have seen a spectacular recovery of more than 1800 points in such a short span after making a low around 16400. And we are now approaching the mega event Budget, so we are seeing this range bound activity in the benchmark index. For the coming session, the next level to watch out for remains at 18350 and once its surpassed, there is no major level visible before 18600. As of now, we do not expect a runaway move in the forthcoming session and hence, traders are advised to keep focusing on individual stocks. Because we can clearly see some sector churning happening. Yesterday banking was sulking throughout the session and IT remained quiet. But Metals stocks had a fabulous comeback as they kept soaring throughout the session. One needs to keep concentrating on such potential movers in order to fetch decent gains. As far as supports are concerned, 18200 followed by 18100 should be considered as intraday levels and the base remains at 18000.

Financial Performance: Mindtree beat our estimates with revenue of ₹2,750 Cr for Q3FY22, reporting revenue growth of 35.9% YoY and 6.3% QoQ. The company posted operating profits of ₹592 Cr, registering a growth of 9.7% QoQ. Furthermore, its Operating Margins expanded by 100bps QoQ to 21.5%, mainly driven by the company’s superior execution and better service mix. Net profit for Q3FY22 stood at ₹438 Cr, registering an impressive growth of 34% YoY and 9.7% QoQ. Operating Performance: On the vertical front, the BFSI vertical grew by 4.2% QoQ and Retail Manufacturing and CPG grew by 0.1% QoQ. Travel & Hospitality reported growth of 7.4% QoQ while the majority of the remaining verticals witnessed a strong recovery during the quarter. Outlook & Valuation: We believe Mindtree enjoys a resilient business structure and has a proven track record of strong and efficient execution capabilities. With depreciation in INR, lower travel cost, and lower on-site expenses, EBITDA margins are likely to expand in the near term. We recommend a BUY on the stock and assign 40x P/E multiple to its FY24E earnings of ₹131.5/share to arrive at a, implying an upside potential of 12% from CMP.   We expect Pharma Universe could report high single digit growth (4.0% YoY), majorly driven by Injectables and Generic segment. India Pharma Market (IPM) grew by 5.8% that is driven by a volume bounce back and recovery in sales of non Covid-19 products. In the US, the generic market continues to be challenging, with mid-single-digit to low-double-digit price erosion across companies, owing to excess supplies in the market and limited one-time/off-contract sales currently. In overall, earnings for the Pharma Universe would moderate and come in flat YoY, after six quarters of healthy performance. Increased competitive pressure on the US base business – coupled with the reduced pace of launches and lower COVID-related off-take – is expected to drag down the overall sector performance in 3QFY22. Pharma Sector update: US market - The recent commentary from global generic players indicates that the US generic market continues to be challenging, with mid-single-digit to low-double-digit price erosion across companies, owing to excess supplies in the market and limited one-time/off-contract sales currently. It is expected that the next round of key US product launches for Indian generic companies is expected only in 2HFY22E that could improve sales going forward in 2HFY22E. We believe the narrative for the US-focussed generic companies would remain weak over the next 2-3 quarters, especially given the backdrop of input cost pressures and gradually-increasing intensity of facility inspections by the USFDA. Gland Pharma & Dr. Reddy are expected to do well in the US market due to speciality product portfolio and strong products pipeline. Domestic Market - The domestic Indian Pharma Market (IPM) market reported a growth of 8% in the last quarter which has recovered from the impact of Covid-19. We expect this growth could continue in upcoming quarters too. The segments like Gastro Intestinal, Respiratory, Pain, and Hormones have outpaced the industry growth. Abbott India, KIMS, and HCG are expected to do well in the domestic market. Covid-19 impact: Gland Pharma, Dr. Reddy (DRRD), and Cadila could benefit with the increase in Covid-19 cases (Omicron impact). DRRD and Cadila have tied up with foreign players to launch their products in the domestic market like Sputnik V, Remdesivir and Molnupiravir, etc. Gland Pharma has a dedicated manufacturing facility to increase the production of Covid-19 drugs. This could increase the revenue of the above companies on a temporary basis. Q3FY21 Performance: We expect EBITDA in 3QFY22 should be sequentially lower for the majority of Indian generic pharma companies. The factors behind it, lower gross margins due to increase in raw material costs; sustained price erosion in the US at approximate 10% YoY during the quarter. Sales growth trend in India is expected to be single high digits for most firms in the last quarter. Top Picks: Gland Pharma, KIMS, HCG.

Meanwhile, the small cap index is shying away from lifetime highs as it is merely 30 points away from its record high · The index continued to march upward after surpassing two months high of 18200. In the process, multi sector participation prevailed backed by improving market breadth that augurs well for the Nifty to head towards revised target to 18600 in the run up to Budget 2022. Key point to highlight is that past 10 sessions 1125 points rally hauled daily stochastic in overbought conditions (at 96). Hence, temporary breather at higher levels cannot be ruled out. However, such a breather should not be construed as negative. Instead dips should be capitalised on as fresh entry opportunity from medium term perspective.

For NBFCs/HFCs, the RBI’s notification relating to harmonisation of IRACP norms would likely result in an uptick in GNPAs. However, excess provisioning under ECL framework over IRACP norms is likely to limit rise in credit cost.
