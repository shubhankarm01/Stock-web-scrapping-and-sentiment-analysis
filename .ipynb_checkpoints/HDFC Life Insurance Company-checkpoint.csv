Updated: 09 Jun 2022,3 life insurance stocks to BUY as recommended by Sharekhan,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/3-life-insurance-stocks-to-buy-as-recommended-by-sharekhan-11654776908994.html,"Owing to the increase in new business premiums, brokerage company Sharekhan has given a bullish outlook on the life insurance sector. HDFC Life (Target price: ₹740), Max Financial Services (Target price: ₹1,100), and ICICI Prudential Life (Target Price: ₹660) are the brokerage's top recommendations with a buy rating. According to Sharekhan for May 2022, new business premium for the industry grew strongly by 89% y-o-y and 37% m-o-m on a lower base of May 2021, which saw muted growth on account of lockdowns. The growth in premium was primarily aided by private players whose NBP increased by 114% y-o-y in May 2022. Among the listed and other large players, SBI Life Insurance (SBI Life) reported the fastest new business premium growth in May 2022 (rose by ~136% y-o-y and 23% m-o-m). While LIC witnessed premium growth of 77% y-o-y and ~35% m-o-m. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance reported at par industry growth in premium (up ~87% y-o-y and 37% m-o-m). Max Life Insurance witnessed premium growth of 62% y-o-y and 32% m-o-m in May 2022. While HDFC Life Insurance reported premium growth of 62% y-o-y (4% m-o-m). Likewise, total annual premium equivalent (APE) for SBI Life Insurance saw strong growth of 182% y-o-y and 16% m-o-m. LIC saw its total APE growing by 79% y-o-y and 37% m-o-m. Total APE for Max Life Insurance rose by 73% y-o-y (39% m-o-m). For HDFC Life Insurance, APE grew by 54% y-o-y and 25% m-o-m in May 2022. For ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, APE grew by 40% y-o-y (flat m-o-m), Sharekhan has further said in a report. The brokerage has claimed in a note that “We believe that after witnessing muted growth in business premiums in January and February 2022, the life insurance industry is witnessing heathy recovery. The protection segment for life insurers is expected to continue to gain pace as supply-side issues subside and non-par and annuity segments are likely to witness strong growth. While ULIPs are expected to remain affected by volatility in capital markets. Further, after witnessing underperformance for the past two years, the insurance sector is poised to return to a healthy growth trajectory. Factors such as a large protection gap and expanding per capita income are key long-term growth drivers for the sector. In this backdrop, we believe strong players armed with the right mix of products, services, and distribution are likely to gain from this opportunity.""

Updated: 03 Sep 2021,Exide Industries shares zoom on insurance subsidiary sale. Should you buy?,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/exide-industries-shares-zoom-on-insurance-subsidiary-sale-should-you-buy-11630645172673.html,"Exide Industries share price today shot up to the tune of 14 per cent after the company's communication with Indian exchanges in regard to 100 per cent divestment in its insurance subsidiary Exide Life Insurance. According to stock market experts, it's good news for Exide Industries promoters as they have managed to crack a deal with HDFC Life Insurance Company, where they will get both cash and equity from HDFC Life. This will help Exide Industries to launch its most awaited lithium battery and hence the stock is expected to remain bullish from short-term to long-term. Speaking on the reason for Exide Industries share price rise; Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities said, ""HDFC Life Insurance is going to acquire Exide Life Insurance, a subsidiary of Exide Industries. In this deal, Exide Industries will not only get ₹726 crore cash, their promoters will be given 8,70,22,222 HDFC Life shares at an issue price of ₹685 per equity share. The company will be able to use this cash for reducing its debt and launching much awaited lithium battery. Apart from this, HDFC Life shares allotted to Exide Industries promoters will increase the investment value in company's financials. So, Exide Industries shares are expected to remain bullish from short-term to long-term."" Avinash Gorakshkar of Profitmart Securities said that Exide-HDFC Life deal is positive for both companies as Exide is getting both cash and shares from HDFC Life while HDFC Life will get the clientele of Exide Life Insurance for its future business. Advising Exide Industries share holders to hold the counter for further gains; Mudit Goel, Senior Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities said, ""One needs to avoid fresh buying at current levels but those who hold the counter should maintain their position with trailing stop loss at ₹184 per equity share. The stock may soon go up to ₹207."" He said that once the stock manages to break this ₹207 hurdle, it will become highly bullish and then fresh buying can be initiated. Exide Industries management informed about its 100 per cent equity sale in Exide Insurance to the Indian exchanges. The BSE informed about the communication citing, ""This is to inform that Board of Directors of Exide Industries Limited (Company) at its meeting held today, has considered and subject to the approval of its shareholders, approved the divestment of the Company's entire equity shareholding in Exide Life Insurance Company Limited, a material wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, by way of sale to HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited.""

Updated: 12 Aug 2021,Max Life’s Q1 metrics mixed but outlook keeps investors hooked,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/max-life-s-q1-metrics-mixed-but-outlook-keeps-investors-interested-11628746820636.html,"Shares of Max Financial Services Ltd have been on an upswing since April and have outperformed peers, such as HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd, and even the broad Nifty50 index. The June-quarter metrics of its subsidiary, Max Life Insurance, were mixed, but the outlook provided by the management seems to offer succour to investors. Max Life Insurance reported a 32% year-on-year (y-o-y) increase in business based on annualized premium equivalent (APE) as its partnership with Axis Bank ensured an increase in product sales. Axis Bank branches contributed 63% of the total business during the quarter, even as proprietary distribution channel suffered due to the regional lockdowns triggered by the second wave of covid-19. Indeed, the effect of the restrictions was visible on business growth, too. Max Life’s APE showed a 54% sequential drop, a fallout of the second wave and seasonality. Nevertheless, the life insurer managed to maintain the market share it had gained in the March quarter at 11%. The management has indicated that a surge in sales through online channels, focus on annuities and robust growth in individual protection plans should help growth. “Considering a gradual shift towards a more profitable product mix and relatively comfortable valuations, we continue to like Max Life,"" analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd said in a note. Another impact of the second wave was on the surge in claims, which were 1.3 times last year’s peak during the pandemic. The life insurer paid out a total of ₹236 crore as claims, which were four times the covid claims of FY21, said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd. But all life insurers have seen a surge in claims and Max Life is not an outlier. Moreover, the insurer has a reserve provision that adequately covers the rise in claims. While higher claims were offset by reserves, Max Life’s value of new business (VNB) growth missed market expectations. An increase in costs and change in product mix was behind this. VNB margin, too, slipped sequentially to 19.7%. The company management has sounded optimistic on margins, going ahead, and believes business growth will bounce back. Needless to say, Axis Bank continues to drive growth for the company. “We estimate a 21% APE CAGR (compound annual growth rate) over FY21-23, with the VNB margin remaining stable at 26% in FY23,"" analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said. With 25% gains since April, Max shares trade at roughly three times estimated embedded value for FY22. This is similar to peer HDFC Life Insurance, but higher than SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd, the largest private sector life insurer in the country."
Updated: 21 Jul 2021,Covid's toll begins to show on HDFC Life books,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/hdfc-life-sees-valuation-under-pressure-as-claims-surge-in-q1-11626755866914.html,"HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd’s June quarter (Q1FY22) showed the flip side of the pandemic on an insurance firm’s performance. A surge in claims prompted it to set aside more reserves towards them. The private sector life insurer paid off 70,000 claims in Q1 totalling ₹1,598 crore on a gross basis, and said that peak mortality claims were 3-4 times that of the corresponding quarter last year. It anticipates claims to stay elevated in Q2 and Q3 too with the threat of a third wave. Therefore, HDFC Life has set aside ₹700 crore as an excess mortality reserve towards these anticipated claims. Its peer ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd reported net claims of ₹500 crore, less than the ₹956 crore of HDFC Life.    "
Updated: 23 Jun 2021,HDFC Life declares a bonus of ₹2180 crore. Eligibility and other details here,https://www.livemint.com/insurance/news/hdfc-life-declares-a-bonus-of-rs-2180-crore-eligibility-and-other-details-here-11624428925670.html,"Mumbai: HDFC Life, one of India’s leading life insurers announced the bonus on its participating plans. The eligible ‘participating’ policyholders will get a share of the surplus generated in the participating fund and their benefit amount will increase with the declaration of bonuses every year. The bonus of ₹2180 crore was announced in the Company’s Board meeting held in April 2021. It exceeds the previous year’s bonus by 44 per cent. 15.49 lakh policyholders are eligible for this bonus. Out of the total amount of ₹2180 cr, Rs1,438 cr will be payable to policies in this financial year, as a bonus on maturing policies or as cash bonuses.

Updated: 26 May 2021,ICICI Prulife’s steady climb in valuations may sustain on growth efforts,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/icici-prulife-s-steady-climb-in-valuations-may-sustain-on-growth-efforts-11622010595264.html,"MUMBAI: Investors of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Ltd have had a lot to cheer for over the past few months and gains in the company's shares reflect this. As such, analysts have noted the modest valuations and held to their buy ratings on the stock. The insurance company added 110 new partners in the March quarter to boost business growth. Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd point out that the company may benefit immensely from its bancassurance partners. But there is another, albeit smaller, push that could benefit ICICI Prulife’s growth. Its banking partners have also grown their deposit base sharply. In fact, deposit growth for banks have been faster in the March quarter. With deposits coming in droves, banks have begun to cut deposit rates. Jefferies points out that this may redirect funds into traditional insurance plans. “Even as the cut in deposit rates primarily reflects the strengthening of their deposit franchise, we believe that it will have a positive rub-off for cross-sell of financial products, especially where returns are guaranteed (like non-par products and annuities) as well as other traditional products like PAR,"" said a note from the brokerage. ICICI Prulife’s bancassurance partners too have announced deposit rate cuts. Considering that they hawk the life insurer’s products, the drop in their deposit rates and the availability of insurance plans on the counter could direct flows into these plans easily. “We understand that these platforms collectively had originated about Rs6-7 billion ( ₹600-700 crore) of annualised new premiums over past year and targets would be to double this in the next 3 years or so, with ICICI Pru Life being a key beneficiary,"" the Jefferies note points out. The bancasurrance channel contributed 42% of the insurer’s annualised premium equivalent (APE) in FY21 and remains the strongest distribution channel. ICICI Prulife has had a tough two years when the company saw its business growth plummet. The pandemic had increased challenges with APE showing a contraction of 12% in FY21. However, the company’s efforts to regain growth has have been appreciated by investors. The fact that its shares trade at a far lower valuation multiple compared with its peers HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd and SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd also works in its favour. The stock trades at a multiple of 2.3 times its estimated embedded value for FY22, cheaper than the multiple of 4.3 for HDFC Life and 2.5 for SBI Life."
Updated: 15 May 2021,"For life insurers, taming of second wave is key to growth",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/beyond-base-effect-life-insurers-may-see-a-modest-fy22-11620709526412.html,"MUMBAI : Investors of India’s life insurance companies will need to look beyond the optically-pleasing growth metrics expected in FY22 to figure out the true performance of insurers. The first step towards this is to ignore the growth rates for April. Latest business data from the sector regulator shows that private life insurers saw their new business premium surge 90% year-on-year (y-o-y) in April while the largest, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), witnessed a 74% increase. But these high percentages are solely due to a low base as April and May last year saw a strict nationwide lockdown due to the pandemic. Growth metrics for the next few months also may reflect such a statistical low base effect. According to analysts, a better way to judge the performance of insurers is to look at a two-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). On a two-year CAGR basis, private life insurers reported 6.2% growth in new business premium, while LIC saw a contraction of 4.7%, point out analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a note. Among private life insurers, HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd trumped peers with a stellar 18% growth, while SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd maintained momentum, they added.       "

Track this space for latest stock market updates.  Indian equities ended higher for the second day in a row, led by gains in banks, financials, FMCG and metal stocks. At close, the Sensex was up 448.62 points or 1.12% at 40431.60, while the Nifty climbed 110.50 points or 0.94% to end at 11873. About 1,470 shares advanced, 1150 declined, and 148 were unchanged. ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Nestle, SBI and GAIL were among the top gainers on the Nifty, while Divis Labs, Eicher Motors, Hero MotoCorp, Cipla and Bajaj Auto dragged. Pharma, IT, media, and auto stocks were, however, under pressure. HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Bajaj Finance were the most traded on the BSE. BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices rose 0.5% each.   After opening with a gap, the Nifty did not do much thereafter. We moved in a 50-70 point range. We need to get past 12050 in order to witness a serious up move. The support lies at 11650. HDFC Limited, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Hindalco are interesting buy ideas traders can work with.   Equitas Small Finance Bank IPO is set to open on Tuesday and aims to raise ₹518 crore. Interestingly, the IPO was expected to be around ₹1,000 crore which was to be completed before September 2019 end as per RBI directives. Due to some technical issues, it could not get through Sebi nod, and hence it was rescheduled for March 2020. However, the Covid-19 derailed those plans again and now finally it is tapping the markets. 25% of the book comes from the highly risky microfinance sector. Considering the rise in NPA across the whole industry due to the fallout of Covid-19, we advise investors to be careful. The true picture of the loans will only be known by March 2021 and until then we advise to stick only to the strongly capitalized lenders. A few well-diversified banks are available below the book value and therefore it makes little to no sense to look at a smaller riskier lender. Therefore we have a avoid on the IPO.   Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said necessary changes are being made in every sector to ensure growth and to make this decade India's, the Press Trust of India reported. He also said that efforts are being made at all levels to make the country a global hub for higher education and its youth competitive.

""...A close below 11600 would apply brakes on the recent optimism and we may then see some extended correction in the market. Till then there is no reason to worry as we may see markets resuming the strength beyond 11850-11900 to surpass the 12000 mark convincingly. In the week gone by, we witnessed some sectoral shift in the market in the second half. The recent outperforming IT space had seen some decent profit booking along with Reliance; whereas on the other side, the banking which was considered to be a laggard has shown some serious strength to support the market. Hence going ahead, if Nifty has to resume the uptrend, the banking clearly plays a vital role in this.

The index has a good support at 11650 and until we do not break that, we are in positive territory. The resistance on the upside is at 12050. If we are unable to move past either levels convincingly, we would be range bound and trading in this zone should be avoided.

Updated: 10 Sep 2020,Investors choose HDFC Life over peers but valuations cause worry,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/why-investors-seem-to-prefer-hdfc-life-among-life-insurers-11599734518910.html,"Shares of HDFC Life Insurance Ltd have recovered smartly since the lockdown was lifted, and are now only 5% lower compared to the pre-covid highs. This compares with a 15-16% drop in shares of other private life insurers such as SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Ltd. What is behind the warmth of investors towards HDFC Life Insurance? To begin with, the private sector life insurer was on a strong footing even before the covid-19 pandemic hit in late March. The company’s FY20 performance was superior to its peers. Profitability indicators, such as value of new business growth and value of new business margin, trumped competitors consistently. For instance, HDFC Life’s value of new business margin was 25.9% for FY20 as against 18.7% for SBI Life and 21.7% for ICICI Prudential Life. Performance for the June quarter showed the impact of the lockdown. But HDFC Life managed to keep profitability metrics from eroding too much. Despite a 33% contraction in new business premium, the insurer kept its margins at 24.1%. Peers ICICI Prudential Life and SBI Life saw a sharper contraction in new business. To be sure, data from the sector regulator shows that HDFC Life has fared far better than peers in recovering from the pandemic’s blow.  The bounce back in new business premium in July and August has resulted in narrowing the decline in business for HDFC Life. On an annualized premium equivalent (APE) basis, the contraction in HDFC Life’s business was just 5% for the first five months of FY21. For SBI Life, the contraction was 19% and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance saw a decline of 40%. While it may seem to justify the valuations, some analysts said the shares may have turned pricey. Edelweiss Securities has kept its rating of reduce on the stock. “Valuations at 4.4 times price to embedded value for FY22 are due to a legacy of higher margin/growth compared to competition, along with brand benefits,"" wrote Edelweiss analysts in a note. A big concern for analysts is the potential moderation in the protection business, which has been a large contributor to margins for HDFC Life. Kotak Institutional Equities has said the increase in ratio of sum-assured to premium payout and the rise in average ticket size indicate that growth in simple term plans may be moderating, relative to that of other traditional products. This is a trend observed for most private sector insurers, but HDFC Life has been at the forefront of pushing protection plans. Besides, even those protection plans bundled with loans may see weak demand, analysts added. Since the protection plans are margin-friendly, this could weigh on them. Nevertheless, HDFC Life’s sustained recovery is its best ally in keeping investors interested. So far, the insurer has given little reason to doubt its revival trajectory."

Updated: 01 Feb 2020,Life insurance companies tumble 5-10% as Budget announces new income tax regime,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/life-insurance-companies-tumble-5-10-as-budget-announces-new-income-tax-regime-11580548258599.html,"New Delhi: Shares of life insurance companies were down 5-10% as finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the Union Budget on Saturday, offered a sharp reduction in tax rates for those who do not avail of any exemptions. While shares of HDFC Life Insurance Company were down 5%, those of ICICI Life Insurance Company and SBI Life Insurance Company slumped 10% lower each. The Nifty 50 was down 1.7% at 11836.25 points. “There is fear among investors that if a lot of people choose the new income tax regime, all these deductions will go. Many tax payers would use life insurance policies and ULIPS (unit-linked insurance plans) to fill their quota of deductions. This may not apply anymore,"" an official at a domestic brokerage house said, adding that even under the old tax regime, it seems about 70 deductions will no longer be allowed. Two other factors that could weigh on life insurance companies’ stocks could be a decline in the broader market and the proposal of Life Insurance Corporation of India’s initial public offering made today. Shares of general insurance companies, though weak, were in line with the decline in the benchmark index. Traders felt it was unlikely the government would do away with deductions for health insurance policies, while most general insurance policies are anyway not covered under these deductions, the official said.

Updated: 08 Sep 2018,"Axis Bank appoints Amitabh Chaudhry as MD, CEO",https://www.livemint.com/Industry/ZU8RLmQC2LATRpDnLeEx1I/Axis-Bank-appoints-Amitabh-Chaudhry-as-MD-CEO.html," Mumbai: Axis Bank on Saturday said it had received the Reserve Bank of India’s approval to appoint Amitabh Chaudhry as the managing director and chief executive officer for a period of three years. Chaudhry’s term will be effective from 1 January 2019 up to 31 December 2021. Chaudhry, who is currently the MD & CEO of HDFC Life insurance Company Ltd, will succeed current CEO Shikha Sharma. Also read: If RBI is right about Axis Bank, it’s not just the CEO that needs to go “Please note that a meeting of the Board will be convened in due course to inter alia, approve the appointment of Shri Amitabh Chaudhry as an additional director of the bank and as the managing director & CEO of the bank, in terms of the said RBI approval and subject to compliance with the prescribed formalities under extant law,"" according to a press statement released on Saturday. Prior to joining HDFC Life, Chaudhry was heading Infosys BPO. He was also the head of the independent validation and testing Unit of Infosys Technologies Ltd. Chaudhry started his career in corporate banking with Bank of America in 1987. He also worked in diverse roles ranging from country finance officer to managing director and technology officer, investment banking, Asia. “After an extensive search, my fellow directors and I are pleased to welcome Amitabh as the bank’s MD & CEO. Amitabh has a proven track record and is well-equipped to lead Axis Bank in pursuing its growth ambitions balanced with a strong emphasis on risk and compliance management,"" Axis Bank Chairman Sanjiv Misra said. The announcement comes after Sharma decided to leave on 31 December, cutting short her term of three years that began on 1 June. Sharma’s move comes at a time when Axis Bank had posted a sharp rise in bad loans.

In the quarters that followed, Axis Bank turned out to be among the banks worst hit by the AQR."
Updated: 26 Dec 2017,‘Most of the life insurance industry wanted status quo on surrender value’,https://www.livemint.com/Money/4wUoGxJCskf9nB3aecL0lM/Most-of-the-life-insurance-industry-wanted-status-quo-on-sur.html," One of the defining features of 2017 has been the public listing of five insurance companies, in life insurance and non-life insurance space. In the case of life insurance companies the markets responded positively and analysts worry that valuations are stretched largely due to market sentiments and the supply and demand gap. Amitabh Chaudhry, managing director and chief executive officer, HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd—the insurer got listed last month-- talks to Mint Money about the potential for the industry to generate value in the future that justifies the valuation. Also being the chairman of the product committee that was constituted by Irdai to look into product reforms, he takes us through some of the key takeaways from the report that was published by Irdai on 14th December. Edited excerpts:  In January, the insurance regulator set up a committee to review existing product regulations, but the report took a long time to come out. Can you tell us why it took so long?  The products committee comprises of leading names from the industry. Together, we have had discussions on different areas, taking into consideration the interest of consumers as well as insurers. The discussions have revolved around aspects such as product design, persistency, surrender value, distribution, file and use, investment and reinsurance. The report took time as there were multiple views to consider.   One of the topics before the committee was to look at surrender value in traditional plans. The report hasn’t given concrete steps on how to increase the surrender value, but it has presented two diverse views: one that asks for status quo and the other that recommends increasing the surrender value. And the report has given two ways to increase the surrender value but why not come with a concrete solution? Surrender value on conventional products was one aspect that was discussed in detail. Since the views were quite diverse, alternatives have been recommended in the report because the committee couldn’t agree on a solution and most of the industry wanted status quo.  Having said that, the report has recommended two methods and both these methods will lead to enhanced surrender values. These recommendations are slightly radical and will impact current product designs, pricing and business models of insurers. But, in the long run, both these approaches will help the industry provide better value to the customer, not just at maturity but during the entire lifecycle of the policy.   You have suggested three ways to improve persistency: by making commissions flexible, by treating regular premium policy as single premium, and by offering a secondary market. How will these improve persistency?  Making commissions flexible will help insurers drive the behaviour of distributors to improve persistency. For example, a distributor with lower persistency can be paid increasing renewal commission rather than high first-year commission. Similarly, linking benefits, surrender values and commissions to each single premium will automatically align the interests of the distributors and customers. As for secondary market, the concept is that even after the customer surrenders the policy, it continues, with one insurer paying premiums to the original insurer in return of the maturity benefit with cover continuance on the life of the customer. This ensures that the policy is persistent as the future premiums are paid to the original insurer according to the original insurance contract. The only difference is that the future premiums are paid by another insurer, instead of the customer (after surrender).  The committee in its report also focussed on disclosures and recommended several disclosures. However, in the case of traditional investment plans that guarantee returns upfront, there has been no recommendation to disclose the net return as was also proposed by the Sumit Bose Committee report. Why is that?  In case of par products, where a bonus is declared, the benefits are at the discretion of the company. While in case of non-par products, the benefits are clear and known to the customer at the outset. When it comes to surrender value of a traditional product, there are two aspects: a special surrender value and a guaranteed surrender value. The special surrender value is typically higher than the guaranteed surrender value and it can usually be changed only after regulatory approval.  The Committee has a view that the current disclosures for non-par products, especially the benefit illustration, adequately communicates the various benefits to the customer year on year during the policy term. This representation for the non-par savings products is the simplest as the benefits are known to the customer at the outset.   Coming to listing and valuations, many analysts hold the view that valuations are stretched largely due to market sentiments and huge demand and supply gap. And this becomes even more visible when you compare life insurance companies in India with their Asian peers. So what are the reasons for being so bullish?  The business is being valued by investors who are investing globally in the insurance industry. They are the same people who are investing in India as well. They are willing to pay for it because clearly they believe in the India growth story and see huge potential for the life insurance sector. The margins in other countries in the Asian market are quite high and the margins can only go down from here, whereas the margins in India, which are currently low, have the potential to go up. There is a huge protection gap in India and given that protection products have the highest margins, there is a large opportunity for the insurance industry. After demonetization we have seen a greater financialization of savings, which will add to the growth. I can safely say that the industry can continue to grow in the higher teens in the long term. Apart from the confidence that investors have in the growth story, it’s also important to understand that the industry has undergone major reforms and is now settling down, the models have matured and we have had consistent growth for the last 4 years if we include this year too.   So in your view demonetization has been a major contributor to financialization of assets? I think yes. The government is making a very clear statement: if you want to avoid tax or your sources of income, life can become very difficult for you. Now it’s just much simpler to pay taxes and be worry-free. This means more money is coming to the real economy because where else will the money go? People are looking for options beyond gold and real estate.  Coming back to margins, can you explain the contributing factors to your profit margins?  The first is that we have a well-balanced product mix across our distribution channels so that each channel is profitable.  Then, as a brand, HDFC Life is cost-conscious and that is reflected in how we spend and save money. The third is our high share of protection business. In protection there are two parts: One is retail, where we sell term plans and other pure protection plans like health, and then there is the group business. Retail protection is about 5% of our overall portfolio currently. But if you also include the group business, then the share of protection jumps to 11% on annual premium equivalent basis. We have about 125 relationships with different entities such as banks, NBFCs and financial institutions. I feel investors definitely see value in us because nobody has the size and spread of distribution like we do.   You said that given the low margins, it can only move up for life insurance companies in India. But can they beat their Asian peers that can be as high as 50%?  I am not talking about 50% margins but there is enough room to grow from the current levels. There are two to three ways in which you can improve margins. You sell products which are high-margin, or reduce the cost or increase productivity. Some insurers are trying to increase productivity by focussing on attaining scale. Costs come down with economies of scale. Our strategy is to look for pools of profitability.  Also, given our strengths, we are in a better spot to take bets on the future. For instance, we have said we want to get into reinsurance business through our subsidiary in Dubai. We took 2 years to set up this subsidiary and no other private company has it. Of course, it’s a 5-10 year bet, but if it works out, it can give us additional profitability; and remember, reinsurance is purely protection. We also took a bet on the pension sector and even after being a 4-year late entrant, we are among the top in this space.  One concern in the life insurance industry is very high expense ratios. Most companies including yours have their expense ratios in double digits which analysts believe to be very high.  I don’t think expense ratios tell you the full story. One company may want to invest in its distribution channels to attain productivity whereas others may have a different view. All the investments are seen as an expense item. People, technology, group partners, all of these factors make up for expenses. Over a period of time, it will reach a scale where it will start coming down. Now, of course, we are doing whatever we can to control our expenses. We are using technology in a big way thereby empowering partners and customers. In fact, for us and for the industry, you will notice that branch expansion has started coming down and insurers are leveraging their distribution relationships.  Having a dedicated bancassurance partner that is also a part of promoter-group company is seen as a success recipe for controlling expenses. Till recently, HDFC Bank was your tied corporate agent, but it also sells products of two other companies. How will this impact your costs, margins and business?  HDFC Bank contributes substantially to our business. The regulator has been nudging for an open architecture and even though it’s optional we know that directionally that’s where the industry is headed. So even though we have a greater reliance on HDFC Bank, open architecture also pushes us to cultivate more relationships. It’s important to face competition and hopefully we will continue to have a lion’s share of the bank’s third party business. As for its impact on our business and financials, that’s where the job of management kicks in."
