Updated: 02 Jun 2022,Duplicate shares: SEBI penalises Eicher Motors for flouting rules,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/duplicate-shares-sebi-penalises-eicher-motors-for-flouting-rules-11654127452944.html,"Eicher Motors has been fined ₹10 lakh by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on June 1 for failing to perform due diligence in a case involving the issue of duplicate shares or new certificates. According to an order issued by the capital markets regulator, the corporation must pay the penalties within 45 days. The order comes after the SEBI received a complaint from Adesh Kaur against Eicher, alleging that 903 shares of the company, which had been held in her name since 1994-95, had been fraudulently transferred to an account of an impersonator who had managed to forge her signature and change her address from Sangrur (her original address) to Mumbai, and then had duplicate share certificates issued in the fraudster's name in lieu of the 903 s. According to Kaur's complaint, Eicher and its Share Transfer Agent (STA) — MCS Limited — performed or processed the change of address from Sangrur to Mumbai and the issuance of duplicate certificates without following SEBI requirements or undertaking adequate due diligence. In its order, the SEBI noted that Kaur had mentioned to Eicher about the fraudulent transfer of 903 shares of the company from her folio in 2013, the value of which was approximately ₹17.52 lakh during the relevant time. Eicher took steps to compensate Kaur by rectifying its register of members and transferred shares of the company to her demat account in May 2021. It is noted that the compensation was made by Eicher only after a specific direction was issued by the Supreme Court in July 2018, directing Eicher to rectify its register insofar as the physical share certificates are concerned. Although the court's direction was issued in July 2018, Eicher compensated Kaur in 2021, almost after three years. By doing so, it violated the general norms for processing documents. ""The time limit as prescribed under...the Listing Agreement and...the LODR Regulations in the matter of issuance of duplicate shares or new certificates has not been adhered to by the noticee (Eicher),"" the SEBI said. Under the rules, a listed entity is required to issue new certificates in cases of loss or old decrepit or worn-out certificates within a period of 30 days from the date of such lodgment. ""The investor was put to loss as a result of the complete failure on the part of the noticee (Eicher) to exercise the expected level of due diligence and professionalism while processing the request for issuance of duplicate certificates from the impersonators,"" the SEBI said. ""By aimlessly shifting the responsibility on its agent for the lapses, the interest of the investor has suffered. Clearly, the noticee has failed in its obligation to exercise due diligence, skill and promptitude while handling the complaint or grievance of Adesh Kaur,"" it added. (With PTI inputs)"

While two-wheeler companies were hopeful of a sequential margin expansion in Q4 on the back of price hikes in January and expected stabilization in commodity costs, one variable is posing a problem now. Even as prices of steel are stabilizing, those of aluminum and precious metals are rising from November–December lows. Two-wheelers’ higher exposure to aluminum and precious metals is likely to dent margins. True, companies can resort to price hikes, but this would impact demand and affordability. “We estimate 2W (two-wheeler) original equipment manufacturers (OEM) would have to increase prices by 2.0-2.5% to fully pass on the recent impact and maintain gross margins at 3QFY22 levels"" said analysts at IIFL Securities in a report. As such, there is a slight relief as analysts believe that the demand is bottoming out now. Demand is set to rebound with the economy opening up and an expected healthy rabi crop season which will aid rural demand. The upcoming marriage season is also likely to help demand. The increased penetration of two-wheelers in Indian households over the years is proof that it is prime to India’s mobility. “The combined effect of big regulatory cost push, weak economy and Covid has resulted in 2W volume declining 34% over FY19-22E. We believe Indian 2W demand is ripe for recovery after the worst fall in five decades. We expect an urban-led revival to drive faster growth for scooters and premium motorcycles vs sub-125cc bikes"" said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd in a report Further, better growth in urban areas will favor the likes of Bajaj Auto Ltd and Eicher Motors Ltd owing to its meaningful presence in the premium segment. TVS Motor Co. Ltd is gaining an increased share in 2W exports. But concerns continue to persist for Hero MotoCorp Ltd as it primarily operates in the entry segment. Investors seemed to factored this going by the underperformance of Hero MotoCorp’s shares vis-à-vis its peers in the past one year. Besides that, Hero MotoCorp does not have a presence in the 3W segment like TVS and Bajaj and it also has a relatively lesser exposure in exports. Meanwhile, the electric vehicle (EV) segment is seeing an increase in new entrants reflecting that EV adoption is accelerating. Listed OEMs are also focusing on expanding their presence in this segment as the whole industry moves towards sustainable options. TVS Motor, Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp are either planning to launch a new electric vehicle in the coming years or expand their current offerings to more cities. “Share of EVs in 2Ws has risen from just 0.4% in FY21 to 3% (~9% of scooters) in Jan-Feb; we expect EVs to form 8% of 2Ws (25% of scooters) by FY25,"" added the Jefferies report"

Against this backdrop, shares of Eicher Motors Ltd rose more than 5%. Management commentary on the company’s outlook also helped sentiments. As such, December quarter (Q3FY22) results were a mixed bag. Eicher’s standalone revenue grew by 1% year-on-year (y-o-y) to ₹2,838 crore. The 15% y-o-y drop in Royal Enfield (RE) motorcycle sales volume was partially offset by the 19% y-o-y rise in net realization per vehicle on the back of price hikes. Still, net realization is 5% lower sequentially due to a fall in the share of export volumes as a percentage of total to 11% in Q3 from 14% in Q2. In general, exports command higher prices but the festive season in India meant the company fulfilled more domestic orders.    "

You become an owner. You may expect to call some of the shots now. But can you? Do you really become an owner in that sense? Do you have a say in big ticket decisions? Notably, do you now have a right to object? Such questions have grown more relevant. The issue was in the spotlight in September 2021, when Invesco as a 17.88% shareholder tried calling an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of Zee Entertainment Ltd. Zee objected to this. Similar cases of shareholder activism have been seen at Eicher Motors, Balaji Telefilms and others. Rarely have Indian citizens been so fascinated with stock markets. Individual investors rose by 14.2 million in 2020-21 alone. Under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, all listed companies must maintain a minimum public float of 25% of their equity. Yet, few Indian retail investors seem aware of shareholder rights. Let’s look at the general rights available under the Companies Act of 2013 (CA). It provides for the right to: 1) Receive information, at the very least by way of a copy of annual return extracts and audited financial statements along with an auditor’s report; 2) Get dividends in case a company announces payouts; 3) Attend and vote at general meetings, both annual and extraordinary; 4) Vote on changes to memoranda or articles of association at a general meeting; 5) Requisition and convene an EGM if shareholders holding at least 10% of the company’s paid-up capital request its board of directors; 6) Appoint and remove directors or auditors by voting in a general meeting; and 7) Vote by electronic means if the entity is a listed company or has at least 1,000 members.

Asian stocks were steady Wednesday as traders mulled another all-time high for US equities and a retreat in short-term sovereign yields ahead of the Federal Reserve policy decision. Shares in China and Hong Kong fluctuated. Japan is shut for a holiday. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were little changed following fresh peaks for U.S. shares. Wall Street has been buoyed by the resilience of company profits to rising input costs amid pandemic-related supply chain and labor disruptions. Among key companies, State Bank of India, Eicher Motors and Pfizer will release their September quarter results today. Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla is close to investing at least $150 million in Vodafone Idea Ltd in his personal capacity, as an immediate measure to keep the group’s cash-strapped telecom business afloat, according to a Mint exclusive. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday tweaked its prompt corrective action (PCA) framework to exclude the profitability parameter from its list of triggers.While capital, asset quality and profitability were the key areas for monitoring in 2017’s framework, this time round capital, asset quality and leverage will be key areas. That apart, RBI has also revised the level of shortfall in total capital adequacy ratio that would push the lender to “risk threshold three"" category. Lenders breaching this risk threshold have the most stringent restrictions placed under PCA. A gauge of the dollar held a climb. Cash Treasuries won’t trade in Asia because of the Japan holiday. US Treasury two-year yields overnight joined a global slide in short-term rates that was unleashed by the Australian central bank’s dovish stance. Australian sovereign yields declined. The gyrations in short-term yields extend a period of heightened bond-market volatility as investors try to anticipate how hawkish central banks might become to quell inflationary pressures. The Fed is expected to announce that it will start tapering its massive bond purchases, but economists are divided on whether a rate liftoff will be next year or in early 2023. Elsewhere, oil fell as the U.S. increased pressure on OPEC+ to boost supplies. (Bloomberg contributed to the story)"

Updated: 02 Nov 2021,"Despite major headwinds, only 2 Nifty Auto stocks gave negative returns in 1 yr",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/despite-major-headwinds-only-2-nifty-auto-stocks-have-given-negative-returns-in-the-last-1-year-11635854922631.html,"Despite a number of major headwinds, the auto sector has risen around 48 percent in the last 1 year. The sector underperformed benchmark Nifty by a small margin, which rose 54% in this period. The underperformance of the sector comes on the back of a steep fall in demand due to the COVID pandemic. Other recent hurdles including chip shortage and rise in raw material prices also impacted the performance of the sector. However, going ahead with the normalcy returning to the market and the demand slowly getting back to the pre-COVID, the sectors present a good investment opportunity for the medium to long term. Even as the performance of the sector has not been the best, only 2 stocks from the Nifty auto index - Hero Moto Corp and Amara Raja Batteries have given negative returns in the last 1 year, falling 8 and percent, respectively. Meanwhile, the remaining 13 constituents from the index under review generated positive returns for investors with Tata Motors surging over 250 percent and Tube Invest rallying over 130% in 1 year. Further, Balkrishna Industries, Ashok Leyland, Bharat Forge, Bosch, and TVS Motor Company advanced between 50% and 90% in this period. The remaining constituents M&M, Bajaj Auto, Eicher Motors, Maruti Suzuki, MRF, and Exide Industries also all gave double-digit returns. Tata Motors has been on the rise especially in the last few months despite weak quarterly earnings on the back of brokerage upgrades and electric vehicle plans. The brokerages remain bullish on the stock even after the loss widened in the September quarter. The company's loss widened to ₹4,442 in Q2FY22 against a loss of ₹314 crore reported in the same quarter a year ago. ""We maintain our positive stance on Tata Motors as (1) PV business to likely gain further market share based on its SUV focused approach, new product pipeline and EV focused approach (2) CV industry is benefitting from cyclical upturn and volumes will be driven by infra, agricultural and e-com segments (3) new refreshes in Land Rover and strong order book to benefit JLR and drive FCF generation,"" Prabhudas Lilladher noted. As for the Auto sector, experts believe that the worst of the chip shortages, which forced supply shortages and production cuts are behind and will improve by early next year. Also, with the economy reopening, there has been a recovery in demand and the sales as well as the booking have been rising in a steady fashion the last few months. However, the rising raw material prices may lead to automakers increasing costs in the near term. The aluminum prices have doubled since April last year. The usage of aluminum in vehicles has also increased in the near term to make the vehicles lighter and improve fuel efficiency. The jump in aluminum, as well as steel prices, can be a concern in the near term and decline bottom line for the automakers. However, as per experts, not considering the recent quarterly earnings and with a little stability in commodity prices, the auto space is expected to do much better from a 1-2 year perspective. Also, the government's big electric vehicle push will immensely benefit the sector."

Equities rose in Japan and China and fluctuated in Hong Kong. Traders digested reports of a video call between Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on economic issues.

Facebook Inc. was higher in late trading on strong user growth and a pledge to buy back as much as $50 billion more in stock. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield edged up and the dollar was steady. The debate over price pressures continues, with former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers saying officials are unlikely to deal with “inflation reality"" successfully until they fully recognize it. Back home, telecom operators, including Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, have asked the Department of Telecom to extend the 5G trial period by six months.

Some 81% of S&P 500 members have reported better-than-expected earnings so far. Traders are also monitoring escalating Covid-19 cases in China and other parts of the world. In China, Modern Land China Co. became the latest builder to miss a payment on a dollar bond, in a further sign of stress in the nation’s indebted real estate sector. Meanwhile, U.S. Democrats stepped closer to an agreement on Biden’s multi-trillion dollar economic agenda. That could allow the House this week to pass a $550 billion infrastructure bill. Crude oil was little changed around $84 a barrel as investors weighed the outlook for US stockpiles and prospects for talks that may eventually help to revive an Iranian nuclear accord, allowing a pickup in crude exports.

Updated: 23 Oct 2021,What if you bought Eicher Motors stock instead its Royal Enfield bike in 2001?,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/what-if-you-bought-eicher-motors-stock-instead-its-royal-enfield-bike-in-2001-11634963363018.html,"Multibagger stock: Rome was not built in a day and it takes time for a good thing to happen. This idiom stands appropriate for stock market investors as patience is one of the most important factors for equity investment. Sometimes perfect value picks may give unexpected return in the long-term and an investor starts thinking alas he had bought the stock instead of the product he or she bought at that time. Royal Enfield bullet of Eicher Motors is a glaring example for such stock market investors. In October 2001, Royal Enfield bike cost was around ₹60,000 and its producer company Eicher Motors share price was around ₹2 per share levels. Today Eicher Motors share price on NSE is around ₹2600. So, Eicher Motors share price has appreciated 1300 times in these two decades. That means, if a person had bought Eicher Motors shares instead of Royal Enfield bullet spending ₹60,000 in October 2001, and had remained invested in the stock throughout this period, its ₹60,000 would have turned to ₹7.80 crore. So, if an investor had bought multibagger stock Eicher Motors in October 2001 instead its Royal Enfield bik, its ₹60,000 would have grown up to ₹7.80 crore. This ₹7.80 crore would have been enough for him or her to buy Audi Q2, BMW bike and BMW car. Even after buying these vehicles, the investor would have been left with ₹5 crore in its bank account as ₹2.80 crore today is enough to buy Audi Q2 and BMW car anywhere in India. Eicher Motors share price history Post-subprime loan crisis in 2008, Eicher Motors shares gave sharp upside move in market rebound. In less than two years time, it hit triple digit in June 2010. It went up to ₹500 per share levels in next 4 years and went on to climb four digit figures in less than 6 months thereafter. So, this multibagger stock appreciated from two digits to four digit figure in around 4 years (in 2014). Eicher Motors share price hit ₹2,000 figure next year while in next two year (in 2017), it went on to climb 3,000 peak. Eicher Motors stock was under sell off pressure before the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic and post-pandemic; it further went down to around ₹1250 per share levels in April 2020. But, in market bounce back post-pandemic, this auto stock gained its lost ground reaching around ₹3,000 per share levels again."

Nifty 100 companies paid chief executives and managing directors an 11% raise in their median remuneration in 2020-21, even while other employees got almost flat pay raises, shows data from primeinfobase.com. To be sure, the coveted club of Nifty 100 directors earning over ₹1 crore in a year shrank as some took pay cuts in solidarity with staffers. But the decline, the first in years, was marginal: 293 directors earned ₹1 crore in 2020-21, down from 297, Mint calculations show. Some industry experts attribute the inequity partly to the extra responsibility the top bosses shouldered in steering their companies through the unprecedented crisis. But as recent face-offs at Eicher Motors and Balaji Telefilms show, shareholders are not too pleased, turning down several resolutions on board remuneration in recent months.               "

India’s largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp reported a 25.9% dip in total sales to 5,30,346 units in September. The company had sold 7,15,718 units in the same month of the previous year. In the domestic market, the company's wholesales dropped to 5,05,462 units last month from 6,97,293 units in September 2020.

Meanwhile, Eicher Motors’ subsidiary VE Commercial Vehicles (VECV) had sold 6,070 units of commercial vehicles in September 2021, registering a growth of 73.1% on a YoY basis. VECV, the unlisted subsidiary of Eicher Motors, had sold 3,506 units of commercial vehicles in September 2020. The commercial vehicles sales are higher by 26.6% as compared with 4,793 units sold in August 2021. Total exports rose 54.5% to 788 units in September 2021 over September 2020. Sales of Volvo trucks & buses remained flat at 56 units. Eicher Motors is the listed parent of Royal Enfield, the global leader in middleweight motorcycles. Eicher Motors share price has opened the day down by 0.5%. Speaking of Eicher Motors, note that Siddhartha Lal is credited with turning around Eicher Motors’ fortunes through his razor-sharp focus on building the Royal Enfield brand and striking a joint venture deal with Swedish truck and bus maker Volvo. When Siddhartha Lal entered the family business in the year 2000, Eicher's management was examining a sale or shutdown of the Royal Enfield business. This was because at that time, Royal Enfield's motorcycle sales totaled 2,000 units per month. From 2,000 units in the year 2000, Royal Enfield sells 70,000 units a month on an average at present. The sales for few months in the past year were impacted due to the impact of nationwide lockdown. Moving on to news from the IPO space, the primary market is set for a flurry of initial public offerings (IPOs) in the October-December period. As many as 35 companies are planning to raise a record ₹800 bn in the third quarter. In comparison, the previous record for a calendar year was in 2017 when 36 companies raised ₹671.5 bn. Paytm, Aadhar Housing Finance, Star Health & Allied Insurance, Policybazaar, Emcure Pharma, Adani Wilmar, and Nykaa are among the most awaited.4 Meanwhile, Paradeep Phosphates, Vedant Fashions, CMS Infosystems, and Northern Arc are also expected to tap the primary markets. Policybazaar and Nykaa are most likely expected to launch their IPOs this month. With equity markets trading at record-high levels, market experts suggest that the IPO euphoria is likely to continue in the coming months with ample liquidity. There’s also strong support from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). So far this year, 42 companies have hit the primary market, raising a record ₹696.8 bn. FPIs contributed to nearly 55% of the funds raised in the IPOs so far in 2021. How the IPO activity pans out amid renewed interest from investors, remains to be seen.

Passenger vehicle sales showed the chip shortage pain and two-wheelers unde-rwhelmed, but the bright spot was the decent growth in commercial vehicles (CVs). The disruption from chip shortage was visible in the volume growth of passenger vehicles for leading automakers. Excluding light commercial vehicles, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd reported a 9% year-on-year (y-o-y) decline in domestic sales volume for August, and has warned that production would drop 60% in September.

A global chip shortage is playing spoilsport with production ramp-ups, while higher raw material prices continue to remain a deterrent to margins. This means that investors should not get over-enthused just yet due to the coming festival season. Indeed, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) reported lower-than-expected Ebitda margins in the June quarter (Q1FY22). Much of the hit has been due to rising covid-19 costs, salary revisions and higher input costs. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. OEMs had to provide for covid-19 related staff expenses, including vaccination costs and higher insurance premiums. Analysts point out that much of this will persist in the coming quarters as well. Further, volume growth has been slow due to regional lockdowns.           "

Addressing shareholders in the company's annual general meeting held virtually, he also termed as ""a good development for the whole of industry"" recent shareholder actions that did not approve expenditures by management on themselves, without specifying details. In the wake of the pandemic, building internal resources has to become a priority of industry and companies. It requires companies to have a more frugal style of management, he said. ""Management themselves need, I think, to curtail the kind of expenditures on themselves personally. Recent shareholder action seems to suggest why a section of shareholders share this view and are voting on these lines and I think that's a good development for the whole of industry,"" Bhargava said without elaborating. Earlier this month Eicher Motors Ltd had failed to get approval of shareholders on a special resolution to re-appoint Siddhartha Lal as Managing Director with increased remuneration, with 73 per cent of them voting in favour and around 27 per cent against. As it was a special resolution, it needed support from 75 per cent of the votes cast to pass the proposal. On Monday the company's board decided to go back to the shareholders for approval of Lal's re-appointment as Managing Director with effect from May 1, 2021, with changes in his remuneration package. Commenting on the learnings from the pandemic, Bhargava said companies which had strong financial reserves, which were generating internal resources and kept reserves were the ones best able to tide over the difficulties created by COVID-19. ""They were able to look after their manpower and employees and to come back to the production required as quickly as possible,"" he said, adding companies have to have the resilience to face the kind of crisis which the pandemic brought. Bhargava, who had in the past stated that the high tax regime is slowing down car demand, reiterated the need to address the issue. ""I am quite clear that if a strong industrial base has to be built in India, the auto industry and the car industry has to reach double digit growths and at present the conditions do not permit that we have it,"" he said. The auto industry veteran cited examples of state governments replacing the annual taxation by one time taxation on automobiles ""in order to meet the immediate requirements of money"", which made the cost of acquisition for customers very high. ""It restricts the ability of people to buy cars and therefore, it restricts the industry,"" Bhargava said. However, he added, ""I am particularly grateful to the Revenue Secretary Union government (Tarun Bajaj) , who has recognised that there is a problem for the car industry. Once that recognition is there at that level of government, I'm sure appropriate solutions will be worked out."" Calling on the industry to partake in nation building, he said, ""The management of industries must all understand and work not only for building companies and meet their limited objectives but think what they need to do to ensure that the industry plays a role in the growth and strengthening of the economy of the country."" Industry has to understand that the purpose of an industry is not only to make the industry work in the interests of the promoter and the shareholders, but at the same time, they have a role to play in building a strong nation, he added. Bhargava further said recent events in the world and in the neighbourhood as well as COVID-19 have highlighted the need of an Indian economy to be much much stronger. ""A strong economy is one of the essentials of safeguarding, independence and our values getting respect in the world. A strong economy also provides the means to build infrastructure in all areas,"" he said, adding over the last 70 years India has not been able to build ""an economy as strong as many of our neighbours"". Bhargava further said, ""We found during the Covid epidemic that the health infrastructure was inadequate to meet much, much larger unexpected demands that were placed on it.""

Yesterday, shares of Zomato fell as much as 10% as the 30-day lock-in period for anchor investors in Zomato’s initial public offering (IPO) came to an end. With the restrictions on sale of shares that these institutions got in the issue, they are now free to sell their holdings in the open market. Zomato ended 8.8% lower at ₹127 on the BSE yesterday, its biggest single-day decline since listing a month ago. The company had raised ₹42 bn from 186 anchor investors ahead of the IPO opening on 14 July by allotting 552.2 m shares at ₹76 apiece. Market regulator’s rules say anchor investors, which are offered a portion of qualified institutional buyers’ segment shares a day prior to the opening of the IPO, can sell their shares only 30 days after the listing. In other news, in a very contrarian take on Zomato, brokerage firm ICICI Securities has initiated a bullish coverage on the company suggesting that the stock could see more upside from current levels. The brokerage firm said, Despite limited operational history and network effect, food-tech adoption at 16% in the Next-500 towns is encouraging. With supply interventions and stronger network effect, we see scope for further increase in adoption also given the lower restaurant density here. Note that Zomato has sparked a debate over its valuation after rising as much as 70% post its debut on the bourses last month. Zomato share price has opened the day down by 2.9%. Moving on to news from the automobile sector, the board of Eicher Motors has decided to reappoint Siddhartha Lal as Managing Director, with effect from 1 May 2021. The board will now go back to shareholders for approval through postal ballot. In an exchange filing, Eicher Motors said, Given the background of actual remuneration paid to the MD in preceding years, the board has now approved a revised remuneration structure for the post, with a maximum cap of 1.5% of profits as per Section 198 of the Companies Act. Last week on 17 August, the shareholders at the company's 39th Annual General Meeting (AGM) had rejected the proposal for re-appointment of Siddhartha Lal as MD. His reappointment as MD was voted down by the shareholders over a 10% hike in his salary proposed amid pandemic when the revenues and profits have been slow. Speaking about the outcome of the AGM and specifically on the remuneration issue, S Sandilya, Chairman of Eicher said, the primary concern with investors was not Siddhartha’s re-appointment as MD or the proposed compensation. Shareholder’s main concern was the lack of clarity regarding the enabling provision that potentially allowed payment of remuneration up to 3% of profits. Note that Siddhartha Lal is credited with turning around Eicher Motors’ fortunes through his razor-sharp focus on building the Royal Enfield brand and striking a joint venture deal with Swedish truck and bus maker Volvo. When Siddhartha Lal entered the family business in the year 2000, Eicher's management was examining a sale or shutdown of the Royal Enfield business. This was because at that time, Royal Enfield's motorcycle sales totaled 2,000 units per month. From 2,000 units in the year 2000, Royal Enfield sells 70,000 units a month on an average at present. The sales for few months in the past year were impacted due to the impact of nationwide lockdown. It remains to be seen whether shareholder approve the revised proposal as previously, they rejected salary hike proposals of Guenter Butschek, the former MD of Tata Motors, as well as Neeraj Kanwar, the MD of Apollo Tyres. Eicher Motors share price has opened the day up by 0.3%. This article is syndicated from Equitymaster.com"

The reappointment comes after a special resolution for approving the appointment of Siddhartha Lal as MD and increase in his remuneration could not get a thumbs up from majority shareholders during the annual general meeting last week.   “Given the background of actual remuneration paid to the managing director in preceding years, the Board has now approved a revised remuneration structure for the managing director, with a maximum cap of 1.5% of profits as per Section 198 of the Companies Act. Specific details of the remuneration are being shared via the postal ballot,"" the company said in a statement.   The minority shareholders especially the institutional shareholders were opposed to an increase in compensation since the company’s sales and operating performance remained subdued over the last two years due to economic slowdown, Covid-19 pandemic and other reasons.   “The primary concern with investors was not Siddhartha’s reappointment as managing director or the proposed compensation; it was the lack of clarity regarding the enabling provision that potentially allowed payment of remuneration upto 3% of profits,"" said S Sandilya, chairman, Eicher Motors.   He further added that over the last four years, the company has had the same limit of 3%, but in reality, paid only a fraction of the amount.

In FY 21, sales of Royal Enfield’s motorcycles dropped by 12% to 573438 units compared to 656651 units in FY 20, which was an 18.46% decline from FY 19. Wholesales took a hit sequentially in the first quarter of FY 22 due to the explosive growth in cases of Covid-19.

Due to softening of sales and increase in input costs, Eicher’s operating performance has also taking a beating in past few quarters.  In 2018, Onkar S Kanwar and Neeraj Kanwar, promoters of Apollo Tyres Ltd, were forced to take a salary cut of around 30% after minority shareholders rejected appointment of Neeraj Kanwar as the managing director of the company, as a result of a subdued financial performance of the company.  According to Manvi Sinha, independent director, Eicher Motors, the increase in remuneration in FY2021 is in line with the average 9.7% increment given to all company employees for the year.    “The median, which is a measure of central tendency, is impacted by entry and exits of employees. During FY 2021, 267 employees joined the company, out of which 77% were hired at below the median salary and 284 employees exited the company out of which 66% were drawing higher than the median salary.

While 73 per cent of the votes favoured the re-appointment, the rest 27 per cent were against it. As a special resolution, it needed support from 75 per cent of the votes cast to pass the proposal. Royal Enfield, a part of Eicher Motors, is a leading player in the mid-sized motorcycle segment with presence across domestic as well as international markets. Making specific note of Siddhartha’s contribution to the growth of the company, Sandilya said, “Siddhartha has been the architect of Eicher Motors’ growth story over the last two decades. When he took over as CEO of Royal Enfield in 2000, the division was making large losses and was slated for closure. Siddhartha has transformed Royal Enfield into a formidable premium motorcycling brand in India, pioneering the leisure riding segment. Royal Enfield grew the premium >250cc market in India exponentially, and has maintained a >90% market share in it for the last decade, resulting in EBITDA margins for EML at over 30% during the pre-pandemic peak. Subsequently Siddhartha moved to the UK in 2015 to personally drive the company’s ambition of becoming the first global premium consumer brand to emerge from India; there he was directly overseeing the product development and international expansion"" In addition to motorcycles, Eicher motors has a joint venture with Sweden's AB Volvo — VE Commercial Vehicles Limited (VECV)."

The resolution was rejected on the grounds of a proposed increase in remuneration at a time when sales of the company’s products and overall operational performance have remained subdued. According to regulatory filings, 26.9% of the shareholders voted against the proposal to appoint Lal as the managing director for five years. To pass a special resolution a company needs to garner support of atleast 75% of the shareholders. Another general resolution to appoint Siddhartha Lal as the director to the board of Eicher Motors was passed by 86.12% of the shareholders during the meeting. Sales of Eicher Motors’ Royal Enfield motorcycles have remained subdued in the last three fiscal years due to factors like economic slowdown, increased prices of products, competition and covid. The second wave and shortage of semi-conductors will impact production and sales in FY22 as well. Hence, shareholders have been mindful of approving a raise in the remuneration of the managing director. According to an analyst from foreign brokerage firm, in the last few years, shareholders have been quite vocal about remunerations of the senior management, especially if the company is going through a tough time. “Eicher might call another shareholder meeting to get the appointment of Siddhartha Lal approved. They might decide to drop the increase in salary bit to get the resolution passed. It’s bit of an embarrassment for the management. Eicher’s vehicle sales and operating performance have dropped in the last couple of years due to various factors. Hence, shareholders have not approved of the board decision,"" added the analyst. Siddhartha Lal has been credited with turning around the fortunes of Eicher Motors by revamping the Royal Enfield brand and overall operations. The joint venture with Sweden’s Volvo AG for manufacturing commercial vehicles has also been positive for the company.

Recently, the Finance Minister said the government is ready to do everything required to revive and support economic growth hit by the pandemic.

PSU bank stocks have opened on a negative note today with Bank of Maharashtra and Central Bank leading the losses. We will keep you updated on what discussions happen in the meeting. Stay tuned. Moving on to stock specific news… Eicher Motors is among the top buzzing stocks today. Royal Enfield wouldn’t be entering the electric vehicles (EV) anytime in the near future, said Siddhartha Lal, managing director at the Bullet motorcycle maker’s parent Eicher Motors. This is because Lal does not see any customer economics at all for that in the premium end of the two-wheeler market. On Royal Enfield’s approach to EVs, Lal said the company is playing a very long-term game on EVs. There are people getting in, it is certainly a less than one percent game, Lal said during Eicher Motors’ earnings call last week. Note that his comments come at a time when the rush for the electric two-wheelers is gathering momentum. Royal Enfield too has formed a team consisting of Allabaksh Nekodi and Satheesh Rajagopal as key executives to define its EV approach, reporting to executive director Govind Rajan. Also, R&D work has begun at its technical centers both in India as well as the UK. But it may take more than four to five years for a Royal Enfield EV to hit the road, as per the current plans. Already mainstream two-wheeler makers in India have started work on a range of EV products. Royal Enfield’s global rivals Norton, Triumph, BSA and Harley-Davidson have all given strong indications on their intention of participating in the EV market. Eicher Motors share price has opened the day up by 0.1%. Here’s an interesting data on Royal Enfield…when Siddhartha Lal entered the family business in the year 2000, Eicher's management was examining a sale or shutdown of the Royal Enfield business. This was because, at that time, Royal Enfield's motorcycle sales totaled 2,000 units per month. From 2,000 units in the year 2000, Royal Enfield sells 70,000 units a month on an average at present. The sales for few months in the past year were impacted due to the impact of nationwide lockdown. This article is syndicated from Equitymaster.com  "
Updated: 13 Aug 2021,Eicher Motors’ earning meets estimate; stock under pressure amid CEO exit,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/eicher-motors-earning-meets-estimate-stock-under-pressure-amid-ceo-exit-11628852197796.html,"On Thursday, Eicher Motors reported a consolidated net profit of ₹2,371 m for the quarter ended June 2021. This compared with a net loss of ₹552 m in the year-ago quarter. The reported bottomline was in line with estimates. Revenue from operations came higher than estimates at ₹19,743 m, surging 141% year on year (YoY). The spike in revenues is largely on account of a low base in the year-ago quarter, as is the case for most of the companies. Compared on a sequential basis, the company’s performance was affected by the second wave. Revenue declined 33% on a sequential basis as demand was hit because of localised lockdowns. EBITDA came in at ₹3,630 m against ₹40 m in the same quarter a year ago. Here’s a table comparing Eicher Motors’ results on key parameters.  Royal Enfield and Volvo’s performance Royal Enfield ended the June quarter with robust performance in international markets with total exports at 17,493 units. This was a 4x rise over the last year, which boosted revenues. Royal Enfield continues to enjoy the premium motorcycle brand name with a 25.9% market share as of fiscal 2021. Have a look at the graph below which shows Royal Enfield's market share in above 125cc segment. Volvo also had a strong quarter as its revenues jumped 156% YoY to ₹16,390 m. Despite strong topline, Volvo reported a net loss of ₹720 m. In the year-ago quarter, it had reported a net loss of ₹1,200 m. During the quarter, VE Commercial Vehicles (VECV), a joint venture between Volvo Group and Eicher Motors, sold 5,806 trucks and buses. This was an increase of 173%, from 2,129 trucks and buses sold over last year. Commenting on the performance, MD Siddhartha Lal said, We continue to believe in our strong business fundamentals and are positive about the long-term prospects and performance of both Royal Enfield and Volvo Eicher. Adding to some worries, Lal warned that the shortage of semiconductors will weigh on production in the upcoming quarter and for the rest of 2021-22. Change in senior leadership The CEO of Royal Enfield, Vinod K Dasari, has stepped down. He also resigned from his role as a director in the parent company Eicher Motors. This comes at a time when there’s a global chip shortage, lack of new models, and rising competition for the company. There are also concerns about the company’s delayed product launches. Vinod Dasari has been the face of Royal Enfield business over the last two years, coming up with various initiatives. Capex plan and the year ahead As demand is rising, the company expects to see an uptick in supply and production in the upcoming quarters. Eicher Motors has lined up a capital expenditure (capex) plan of around ₹5,000 m. This is similar to the previous financial year. During the quarter, Royal Enfield expanded its presence in international markets and commenced operations in Singapore and the Netherlands with the launch of standalone flagship stores. The company also announced the commencement of local assembly of motorcycles in Colombia, the third-biggest motorcycle market in Latin America, in partnership with its local distributor. Journey of Eicher Motors When Siddhartha Lal entered the family business in the year 2000, Eicher's management was examining a sale or shutdown of the Royal Enfield business. This was because at that time, Royal Enfield's motorcycle sales totaled 2,000 units per month. Siddhartha asked for time to give this business a shot as he felt it had immense potential. When he joined, Eicher Motors was dabbling in 15 different businesses, ranging from motorbikes, trucks, tractors, to garments, footwear to name a few. But the crucial part? It was the market leader in none of them. Being an avid and passionate biker himself, Siddhartha Lal took the tough call of retaining only two of the family businesses - motorcycles and trucks. He decided to sell the rest. From 2,000 units in the year 2000, Royal Enfield sells 70,000 units a month on an average at present. The sales for few months in the past year were impacted due to the impact of nationwide lockdown. How the stock markets reacted to Eicher Motors’ earnings Ahead of its earnings yesterday, Eicher Motors share price ended 4% lower at ₹2,615.45 on the BSE. Today, the stock declined as much as 3.5% in early trade to ₹2,524. The change in senior management has led to many brokerages turning cautious on the stock, hence the decline of 8% in the past two days. Eicher Motors share has a 52-week high of ₹3,035.50 touched on 22 January 2021. It has a 52-week low quote of ₹2,007 touched on 14 August 2020.

Updated: 12 Aug 2021,"Markets may remain volatile; Tata Steel, Eicher Motors, Hero Moto in focus",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/markets-may-remain-volatile-tata-steel-eicher-motors-hero-moto-in-focus-11628735893275.html,"MUMBAI: Markets are likely to see continuation of volatility while trends in SGX Nifty indicate a flat opening of Indian benchmark indices on Thursday. On Wednesday, the BSE Sensex closed at 54,525.93, down 28.73 points or 0.05% and the Nifty ended at 16,282.25, up 2.15 points or 0.01%. Asian shares failed to follow a strong close on Wall Street with fears about the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus weighing on sentiment even as tame US inflation eased fears the Federal Reserve would rush to reduce its economic support. That data also caused dollar to retreat against most major currencies and US Treasury yields to edge down overnight though both were steadier in Asian hours. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.25% in early trading, dragged by a 0.24% decline in Chinese bluchips. The Hong Kong benchmark fell 0.2% while Australian shares were largely flat and Japan's Nikkei rose 0.35%. The weaker performance by Asian benchmarks contrasts with the situation elsewhere in the world. On Wednesday the MSCI all-country index, a gauge of stocks across the globe, hit a record high. In comparison the Asian benchmark is down over 10% from its February peak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closed at record levels on Wednesday, after the US Labor Department reported the largest drop in month-to-month inflation in 15 months, easing concerns about the potential for runaway inflation. Among key companies Tata Steel, Bharat Petroleum, Eicher Motors, Hero Motocorp, NMDC, Aurobindo Pharma, IRCTC, Ashok Leyland, Page Industries, Bharat Forge, Oil India and GR Infraproject will announce June quarter earnings today. PNB Housing Finance is now looking to raise ₹35,000 crore debt, after facing legal hurdles in the Carlyle group deal, days after SAT gave a split verdict in the matter. The company will seek shareholders'' nod in its annual general meeting (AGM) on September 3, 2021, PNB Housing Finance said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. Cigarettes-to-hotels conglomerate ITC Ltd has undertaken an “extensive strategy reset"" that will power the company’s next phase of growth as it taps into newer opportunities across businesses with a strong focus on digital and sustainability, chairman Sanjiv Puri said at the company’s 110th AGM on Wednesday. US policymakers are publicly discussing how and when they should begin to trim the massive asset purchases launched by the Fed last year to stabilise financial markets and support the economy through the coronavirus pandemic. The easing of fears about inflation reduces the pressure to taper those asset purchases soon rather than later in the year, after strong employment figures last week had given ammunition to those with a more hawkish tilt. As a result, U.S. Treasury yields fell on Wednesday across most maturities, though trading was choppy. Moves were more muted in Asian hours. Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was last 1.3455% compared with its U.S. close of 1.359%. The dollar hovered below a four-month peak against major peers on Thursday, after retreating overnight as yields dropped. Oil largely held onto gains from earlier in the week, U.S. crude dipped 0.03% to $69.23 a barrel. Brent crude was flat at $71.43 per barrel. Gold also held on to overnight gains on Thursday, with the spot price down 0.1% having risen 1.3% in the previous session. Easing of fears about higher interest rates would typically help the non-interest bearing asset. (Reuters contributed to the story)"
Updated: 23 Jul 2021,Zomato shares deliver stellar returns on Day 1,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/zomato-makes-stellar-debut-mcap-hits-over-rs-1-trillion-on-day-one-11627048986809.html,"Mumbai: Zomato Ltd delivered sterling returns for investors, surging 65% in its stock market debut on Friday and turned its founder, Deepinder Goyal, into a billionaire. The 13-year-old food delivery company ended trading at ₹125.85 on BSE, valuing the company at $13.3 billion. But, soon after its trading debut, Zomato’s market value soared past the ₹1 trillion mark, catapulting it to one of the 50 most valuable publicly traded firms in India, beating storied companies such as Mahindra and Mahindra, Tata Motors and Coal India Ltd. The company’s shares opened trading at ₹116 on NSE, a 53% premium over the IPO price of ₹76, and then hit an intraday high of ₹138.90. Zomato became the first major new-age Internet firm in India to trade publicly. A raft of Internet firms—many of them loss-making like Zomato—is set to go public soon as the disruptions caused by the pandemic prompted an unprecedented surge of people ordering food, buying groceries and making payments through apps. At the close of trading, founder Goyal’s stake in the food delivery company was worth around ₹4,650 crore. Goyal holds 5.5% or 369.47 million shares in Zomato. He was also allotted 368.5 million options in April. If Goyal exercises the options, which vest over the next six years, his net worth will be worth $1.25 billion at Friday’s prices. In a blog post, Goyal thanked staff, investors and rival companies for contributing to Zomato’s success. “The tremendous response to our IPO gives us the confidence that the world is full of investors who appreciate the magnitude of investments we are making and take a long-term view of our business,"" Goyal wrote in a blog post on Friday. “I don’t know whether we will succeed or fail—we will surely, like always, give it our best,"" he said. The Zomato IPO was subscribed about 40 times last week. It received bids for 29.04 billion equity shares against an IPO size of 719.23 million equity shares. The IPO aimed to raise ₹9,375 crore. “Zomato listing signifies a strong risk appetite for the new and next-generation business models. Today’s listing performance will provide a positive signal to the Indian startup ecosystem. We could see this trend continue in the upcoming IPOs, as the present market conditions are conducive for the primary market,"" said Naveen Kulkarni, chief investment officer, Axis Securities. Others concur. Though the listing is much above expectations, current investors can hold on to their shares as this new business is forecast to grow at the high digit in the early stage of the cycle, said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services. “New and existing investors can accumulate on a short- to medium-term basis, as the trend of stock price stabilizes. A key factor for the stock price to sustain this euphoria is demonstrating improvement in profitability in the coming quarters. The company is expected to turn a profit soon; else, the stock performance will be impacted,"" Nair said. Ahead of Zomato’s IPO, analysts were optimistic about listing gains but were cautious about the company’s long-term risks. The expensive valuation demanded at a time the food delivery service is still making losses and upcoming competition with Amazon’s entry into the segment are making analysts wary. Zomato operates in a duopoly—the other player being Swiggy—and has created strong entry barriers with a widespread network. It operates in a highly under-penetrated market where of the total food consumption in India, only 8-9% is from restaurants, of which only 8% is online food delivery. “With growing internet penetration and the number of smartphone user base increasing month after month, the entire private digital ecosystem will enable wealth creation and further deepen our capital market,"" said S. Ramesh, managing director and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Capital Co. Zomato is yet to turn profitable. Over FY18-21, the company grew its revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 62%. While business is at a nascent stage and began gaining traction since FY18, Ebitda losses have narrowed significantly."

According to analysts of Motilal Oswal Institutional Equities, demand for Royal Enfield motorcycles was back at pre-covid levels in the fourth quarter and is expected to improve going forward on the back of new launches and expansion to international markets. “After witnessing severe headwinds over the last 18 months, we expect volumes to grow hereafter. The company continues to expand its addressable market through distribution expansion (through smaller format stores), price laddering (by offering multiple 'trim' levels), new product launches (Meteor and more in the pipeline), and mass personalization through the ‘Make it Yours’ platform,"" analysts of Motilal Oswal Institutional Equities said in a note. Eicher Motors on Thursday reported a 73% year-on-year jump in its net profit to Rs526 crore for the March quarter as demand for its middle-weight motorcycles recovered on the back of gradual improvement in economic output. Revenue from operations increased 33% y-o-y to Rs2,940 crore as a result of a 25% increase in sales of its motorcycles to 203,343 units. Operating profit also jumped substantially to Rs634 crore compared from Rs47 crore in the corresponding period due to higher sales, prices increases and cost cutting measures. Its commercial vehicle manufacturing venture, Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicle Ltd (VECV ), also reported a net profit of Rs127 crore compared to a loss of Rs27 crore as sales of heavy and medium commercial vehicle showed signs of recovery. Revenue for the quarter rose 71.4% to Rs3,602 crore. According to analysts of ICICI Securities, Eicher Motors is likely to witness a growth tailwind in FY22 and FY23 as both underlying market rebound, and new product launches stimulate demand. However, higher input costs and new platform costs stabilization could hinder pace of margin recovery. “We believe, in the near term covid is likely to dampen demand, however, new product success coupled with improved customer life-cycle experience are likely drivers for potentially a strong rebound in second half. Valuations remain fair,"" they added."
