05:53 AM IST,TCS Q1 profit misses estimates on costs,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/tcs-q1-profit-misses-estimates-on-costs-11657301814159.html,"Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) reported a 5.2% rise in quarterly profit from a year earlier, missing analysts’ estimate, as rising employee costs squeezed earnings even as demand remained robust. The Mumbai-based company’s net profit rose to ₹9,478 crore in the quarter ended 30 June from ₹9,008 crore in the year ago. However, that trailed the ₹9,907 crore consensus profit estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Revenue for the June quarter grew 16.2% from a year ago to ₹52,758 crore on the back of broad-based growth, in line with the consensus Bloomberg estimate of ₹52,491 crore. “We are starting the new fiscal on a strong note, with all-round growth and strong deal wins across all our segments. Pipeline velocity and deal closures continue to be strong, but we remain vigilant given the macro-level uncertainties. Looking ahead, we remain confident in the resilience of technology spending and the secular tailwinds driving our growth,"" said Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive officer and managing director of TCS. The macro-level uncertainties that Gopinathan refers to relate to possible recessions in the US and Europe, where central banks are raising interest rates aggressively to tame red-hot inflation. Indian software services companies, which generate more than 90% of their revenues from these regions, may see sharp cuts in IT spending by clients located in these nations if the rate hikes tips their economies into a recession. If clients indeed scale back spending, it will come after two pandemic years of robust demand for digital and cloud computing services as companies scrambled to digitize their operations. Some analysts fear peak revenue growth for IT services companies is likely behind them, and the momentum is expected to start softening from the second half of the fiscal year because of fewer large deals and clients postponing spending. In addition, margins are under pressure due to wage hikes, higher hiring costs, and increased travel, visa, and other discretionary expenses. However, researcher Gartner expects IT spending to remain strong in the second half of the calendar year. “Gartner projects that overall IT services spending will grow at 6.2% in 2022. Despite the macroeconomic uncertainties, Gartner believes that overall IT demand will remain robust for the second half of 2022,"" said Naveen Mishra, senior director analyst at Gartner. TCS’s operating margin contracted to 23.1% from 25.5% in the year-ago period due to “annual salary increase, the elevated cost of managing the talent churn, and gradually normalizing travel expenses,"" said Samir Seksaria, chief financial officer, TCS. He told reporters that TCS would use better workforce utilization, growth, and other operational efficiencies to get back to the optimum level of margins. The dollar revenue for the June quarter grew 15.5% in constant currency terms from a year earlier to $6.8 billion amid an order book worth $8.2 billion. In terms of industries, growth was led by retail and consumer packaged goods (25.1%), followed by communications and media (19.6%), manufacturing (16.4%), and technology and services (16.4%). The banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector, the largest vertical for TCS, grew 13.9%, while life sciences and healthcare grew 11.9%. Analysts believe TCS is likely to be one of the key beneficiaries of the medium-term uptrend in technology spending. “We expect TCS to gain market share on the back of vendor consolidation and captive monetization efforts. However, moderation in Ebit margin and lower order book would reduce the pace of earnings growth going ahead and may lead to a downward revision to valuation multiple,"" said Mitul Shah, head of research at Reliance Securities. On a trailing 12-month basis, the attrition rate increased to 19.7% in the June quarter from 8.6% in the year-ago period, indicating a growing demand for tech talent in the industry, especially in digital skills. The company added 14,136 employees during the quarter, taking the total headcount to 606,331. TCS declared its earnings after the end of trading on Friday. Ahead of its results, the shares fell 0.67% to ₹3,264.85 on BSE."

Updated: 24 Jun 2022,"Top largecap, midcap, smallcap Indian IT stock picks as suggested by brokerages",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/stocks-to-buy-here-are-top-largecap-midcap-smallcap-indian-it-stock-picks-recommended-by-brokerages-11656063308791.html,"Indian IT stocks have recently been under pressure amid the current market selloff. Recession fears leading to possible reductions in IT spending by clients has also dampened the sentiment of the investors. Recently, various global brokerage and research firms have downgraded Indian IT sector, and also trimmed earnings estimates for FY23. Domestic brokerage and research firm Edelweiss in its latest report on IT said that it prefers HCL Tech, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) among the large-caps and Coforge, LTI and Mindtree among midcap IT stocks. Among small caps, it prefers Zensar Tech, Birlasoft and Firstsource Solutions. Accenture’s strong performance and solid commentary supports brokerage Edelweiss' thesis of a robust tech upcycle. “Its outsourcing growth remains high and bookings also remain strong, which bodes well for Indian IT services companies,"" it said in a note. Analysts at brokerage JM Financial said that Accenture’s results confirm the ‘All’s well for now’ thesis for Indian techs despite increasing concerns of hit on IT spending given a weak macro set up. “Our channel checks also suggest that demand is holding up well for Indian techs for now with the likely macro set up expected to benefit offshore techs, albeit with a lag."" Infosys and HCL Tech are the brokerage's top stock picks amongst Tier I techs, while Mphasis, Persistent Systems amongst Tier II ‘s and Zen Tech and Firstsource amongst small caps. “While supply-side challenges remain a point of concern, with elevated attrition and lower headcount addition, Accenture's margin guidance implies a stable margin performance in FY23. While strong revenue growth and commentary on the pipeline is positive for the IT Services sector, weak employee addition (lowest in the last six quarters) and moderation in deal bookings (-13% QoQ) should dampen the demand outlook,"" said another brokerage Motilal Oswal. The brokerage has maintained its positive stance on the IT sector as it expects sustained growth with stable margin. Infosys, HCL Tech, and TCS remain its preferred stock picks within the Tier I IT space. The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint."
Updated: 20 Jun 2022,Fired TCS employee gets back his job after 7-year battle,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/fired-tcs-thirumalai-selvan-gets-back-his-job-after-7-year-battle-read-his-story-here-11655717066600.html,"Sacked in 2015, did freelance work as software consultant and a real estate broker, fought  a court case and now 48 year old Thirumalai Selvan can sigh a heave of relief when a Chennai court has ruled that Tata Consultancy Services should pay him his salary and benefits of seven years in full. That's right, the Chennai court ordered TCS to pay Selvan his complete salary for the past seven years and reinstate him into the company.  Read the story here. Thirumalai Selvan had worked for TCS, an information technology company for eight years before he became a victim of the mass layoffs in 2015.  Selvan was asked to leave citing poor performance, wherein the information Technology company said his performance was not up to its expectations. Selvan then approached the court seeking continuity of service. Selvan served on a managerial position in the company. After the layoff, he was forced to look for freelance jobs. As a software consultant and a real estate broker, Selvan managed to earn ₹10,000th per month. His family depended on savings and his wife’s salary. TCS in their argument stated that Selvan was working in a managerial cadre and would not come under the category of ‘workman’. However, C Kumarappan, Principal Labour Court’s presiding officer said, “The reason for not mentioning the petitioner’s other duties is nothing but a subterfuge, to camouflage his principal nature of duty"". The court observed that Selvan’s primary role was that of a skilled worker. Adding to Selvan’s financial troubles were legal hassles. “I would have travelled to the court more than 150 times in the last seven years,"" he told DT Next. After spending seven years, the Chennai court ruled in his favour. It refuted TCS’ argument that Selvan belonged to the managerial cadre and was not a workman -- someone with a specified skill. The Forum for IT Employees (FITE), that helped Selvan in his court case, celebrated the judgement. “Justice anywhere is hope everywhere and a reminder to all who are forcing employees to resign,"" the group was quoted as saying by the Federal website. “Great work done by Team FITE Chennai and salute to the TCS employee who fought for justice."" A mechanical engineer by graduation, Selvan worked in his core sector for four years before switching to the software lane in 2001. He became a part of TCS as an assistant systems engineer in 2006. Meanwhile, share of the top Indian IT company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) have fallen sharply amid the current market volatility and the IT stocks are trading near their respective 52-week low levels. TCS shares are down about 18% in 2022 so far whereas that of Infosys have fallen more than 25% during the same period.  "

Updated: 09 Jun 2022,Telcos and tech cos at loggerheads on 5G private networks,https://www.livemint.com/industry/telecom/telcos-and-tech-cos-at-loggerheads-on-5g-private-networks-11654767817399.html,"NEW DELHI: Indian telecom operators and the Broadband India Forum (BIF) are at loggerheads over the issue of private entities being allowed to set up captive networks with direct allotment of 5G spectrum. The Forum, comprising members such as Tata Consultancy Services, Amazon, and Meta, among others, has said that private networks are revenue generators for the government and giving out 5G spectrum to set up private networks does not pose a security threat as the networks are closed and disconnected from public telecom networks. In a position paper, Broadband India Forum has emphasised that the government should have a forward-looking approach towards use and advancement of technology, while asking the Centre to earmark certain amount of exclusive spectrum for private 5G networks in each type of spectrum band. “Allow direct allocation of spectrum to enterprises/organisations at nominal administrative fee, as per global best practices,"" it said. “Facilitate a light-touch online portal based paperless regime for acquiring permission/license for ‘Captive Wireless Private Network (CWPN)’ within 30 days of application, (as recommended by Trai) to enable ease of doing business,"" the body led by technology companies has said. It has argued that private 5G networks were best set up by enterprises since public networks cannot deliver the levels of efficiencies required. It added that such networks would make for additional revenue streams for telcos and the government, since they will purchase the spectrum at a price fixed by the government and allocated administratively. The Forum noted that the perception that spectrum can be assigned only through auction is grossly inaccurate and misleading, referring to the Supreme Court guidelines on spectrum allocation issued in 2012. It also said that private 5G networks were not allowed for external communications and the need for lawful monitoring, interceptions and the possibility of threats to national security do not arise at all. Indian telcos, on the other hand, have written to the government against direct allocation of 5G airwaves to private companies as it will adversely impact the enterprise businesses of telecom companies and will leave no business case for the carriers to roll out 5G services. In a communication to telecom minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) which represents Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, has sought the government’s “urgent intervention"" to protect the interest of telcos. The association said giving away dedicated spectrum for private captive networks will hurt the financial health of the industry which is on the path of revival after the government’s relief package last year. “We request your urgent kind intervention in the matter so as to ensure that the interest of the TSPs as well the enterprise segment is efficiently catered to,"" the association said in a letter to the minister on Thursday. This comes in response to private companies such as Tata Consultancy Services seeking direct allocation of 5G spectrum, following recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) that had left it to the government to either license out the airwaves directly or through a leasing model via existing telcos. The telecom department has taken an internal view that telcos were best suited to provide the services to private companies, however a final decision on the matter is yet to be taken. The association had on Wednesday said in a position paper that there was no justification for allocating radiowaves directly to enterprises for operating private captive networks, and that licensed telecom companies are fully capable of providing all customised solutions in the most competitive and economic manner. “If independent entities set up private captive networks with direct 5G spectrum allotment by DoT, the business case of TSPs (telecom service providers) will get severely degraded... This will diminish the revenue so much that there will be no viable business case left for the TSPs and there will not remain any need for 5G Networks rollout by TSPs,"" the association said in the letter to the ministry sent on Thursday. “If private captive networks for enterprises are set up independently by other entities then this would mean dramatically altering the industry dynamics and hurting the financial health of the industry and will strike at the very heart of the business case,"" it further stated. The association has said that worldwide, statistically, wherever 5G has been rolled out, any consequent revenue increment has not come from the retail segment but rather only from the enterprise segment. It also argued that revenues of telcos are not going to increase from the retail segment despite very heavy capital investments for rollout of 5G networks, which will get accentuated further because of the high price-sensitivity of the market. “The new segment that would be benefitted by 5G services of the TSPs is the enterprise segment including manufacturing, logistics, education, hospitals, campuses, factories, etc. Our TSP members have also conducted successful 5G trials for many of these use cases in the last one year,"" the association said, noting that with 5G auctions, telcos were targeting the enterprise segment for revenue enhancement."

Updated: 19 May 2022,No-code bot platform E42 launches marketplace for businesses to hire AI employee,https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/nocode-bot-platform-e42-launches-marketplace-for-businesses-to-hire-ai-employee-11652957618284.html," New Delhi: Indian artificial intelligence (AI) bot platform, E42, which specializes in developing no-code, automated AI bots for various services, has launched a marketplace to help businesses hire such bots. The marketplace will be a store for E42’s own clients to put up their own AI bots, which can then be licensed or hired by other businesses to deploy on their own services. Animesh Samuel, co-founder and chief executive of E42, told Mint that the platform’s bots, which he refers to as “AI workers"", are more developed and complicated than just chatbots. The latter are services deployed across various websites to automate customer queries, in a bid to augment human-driven customer services. Samuel said that while E42’s AI workers include chatbots, they are more advanced in terms of the tasks that they can execute. These “complicated"" tasks include AI bots that can automate the workflow of a company’s human resources and accounts departments – and also work as an analyst by processing data. E42 so far has about 20 clients, which include the likes of Tata Consultancy Services, Hindalco and Mahindra & Mahindra. Samuel said these clients, which have used E42’s AI platform to build their bots, can now offer the application programming interfaces (APIs) of the developed bots through the newly launched marketplace – from where third party companies can “hire"" them for a fee. The process, according to Samuel, eliminates the need for smaller companies with limited resources to go through the process of developing and deploying their own automated bots – which could be complicated for those without access to ample data to train these services. To be sure, the E42 marketplace is not the only click-to-deploy AI bot marketplace in India. American software firm Automation Anywhere already has a similar AI bot store, which offers automation packages developed by the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Microsoft, Google and others. Big tech firms have their own AI automation marketplaces as well. For instance, Amazon has its Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace, which offers services such as Accenture’s Conversational AI Platform as click-to-deploy tools for business. Microsoft, similarly, also has its Azure Marketplace offering similar services. E42’s Samuel added that the question of such AI “workers"" replacing humans in existing jobs is not out of the question. “This moment would be similar to the advent of the personal computer, which replaced a lot of human work such as physical book-keeping in accounts. While some jobs will become obsolete, this will make way for humans to take on more advanced roles, and upskill their profiles,"" he added."
