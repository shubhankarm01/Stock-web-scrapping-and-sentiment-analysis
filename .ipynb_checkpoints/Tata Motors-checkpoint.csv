Updated: 01 Jul 2022,Tatas just came a bit closer to becoming India’s first semiconductor powerhouse,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/tatas-just-came-a-bit-closer-to-becoming-india-s-first-semiconductor-powerhouse-11656672417367.html,"India’s largest electric carmaker, Tata Motors, and Japanese chip manufacturer, Renesas Electronics, are partnering to design and develop semiconductors. The tie-up will help Tata Motors tide over the global auto chips crunch that has affected its earnings and resulted in production cuts and even temporary plant shutdowns. Designing chips in collaboration with Renesas will come in handy for the current and newer electric cars to be made by Jaguar Land Rover. Electric cars are the future of the auto industry. Tata Motors, which sold 19,105 electric cars last year, a more than a four-fold jump from the 4,218 in the year ended March 2021, has doubled down on its investments in the segment. Tata Motors had a market cap of $17.5 billion as of 29 June; the electric car division managed to raise $1 billion from TPG, the private equity group, at a $9.1 billion valuation in October last year. As car makers across the world look to make electric cars, computing power has emerged as the new horsepower. More microchips, such as the ones Renesas makes, are getting embedded in cars. These microcomputers control varied functions from fuel injections to running infotainment systems and acting as the car’s brain for cruise control.        "

The partnership of almost two years stands out, as tie-ups between auto companies invariably end up on the chopping board. Cracks start to appear within two or three years. The sector has a history of divorces following short honeymoons: Ford-Mahindra; Tata Motors-Volkswagen (the joint venture stalled and was called off before take-off); Mahindra-Renault and so on. In Toyota-Suzuki’s case, however, the relationship has been growing stronger and deeper in defiance of the history of car-makers’ demonstrated record of finding it hard to blend cultures of manufacturing and business alliances over the long term. The net outcome of the marriage between Toyota and Suzuki could prove to be an automotive landmark. What’s different about the Toyota-Suzuki dalliance? For one, there’s a crystal-clear business case for who brings what to the table. Suzuki (Maruti) is the undisputed market champ in India in terms of revenue, with proven expertise in two distinct domains: lightweight manufacturing and small cars. Toyota, on the other hand, is revered in Japan, where it is the number one maker of cars, and an established leader in hybrid and electric automotive technology; its hybrid car, Prius, has been around for 25 years.
