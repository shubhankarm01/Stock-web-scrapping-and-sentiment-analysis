The Indian rupee fell 19 paise to close at all-time low of 79.04 (provisional) against US dollar. The surge in the dollar has set Asian currencies on course for their worst quarter since 1997 and created a dilemma for central bankers. Shares slipped on Wednesday in Europe and Asia ahead of the latest update on US economic growth, while oil prices were lower. A weaker-than-expected US consumer confidence reading highlighted worsening consumer expectations due to persistently high inflation. Shares fell in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and South Korea.  Indian indices snapped their four-day gain on Wednesday amid weak global market trends and inflation concerns.

India's biggest cement producer, UltraTech Cement, is importing a cargo of Russian coal and paying using Chinese yuan, according to an Indian customs document reviewed by Reuters, a rare payment method that traders say could become more common. UltraTech is bringing in 157,000 tonnes of coal from Russian producer SUEK that loaded on the bulk carrier MV Mangas from the Russian Far East port of Vanino, the document showed. It cites an invoice dated June 5 that values the cargo at 172,652,900 yuan ($25.81 million). Two trade sources familiar with the matter said the cargo's sale was arranged by SUEK's Dubai-based unit, adding that other companies have also placed orders for Russian coal using yuan payments.

The share price of India's top valued company has given fresh breakout and is poised for more upside, as per analysts.   While steel prices in India have corrected sharply to ₹60- ₹61k/t, domestic demand has also recovered sharply as consumer de-stocking is behind us. Analysts at JPMorgan do not see further declines in the domestic steel market.   Shares skidded in Asia on Wednesday after another broad decline on Wall Street as markets remain gripped by uncertainty over inflation, rising interest rates and the potential for a recession. US futures edged higher while oil prices fell back. A weaker-than-expected US consumer confidence reading highlighted worsening consumer expectations due to persistently high inflation. That “dragged equities lower as sentiment soured for risky assets,"" Anderson Alves of ActivTrades, said in a commentary. Investors are awaiting comments later in the day by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and other top central bankers, he said.

On the first day, the 47th GST Council chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and comprising state counterparts, decided to tweak tax rates of some goods and services, including bringing pre-packed and labelled food items under the tax net to check evasion.

Sandeep Kumar Gupta, Director for Finance at Indian Oil Corporation, has been picked to head India's largest gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd, the government headhunter said. The Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) selected Gupta, 56, for the post of chairman and managing director of GAIL after interviewing 10 candidates, it said in a post-interview notice. He will replace Manoj Jain, who is scheduled to retire on August 31.   Last year, government has issued a notification regarding Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021, in which single use plastic will be banned from 1st July 2022. Given, the rising concern over climatic change and environmental pollution, the extension of this deadline is very unlikely. The ban is on rigid plastic items such as plates, cups, glasses, cutlery, wrapping or packaging films, PVC banners less than 100 micron, straws and stirrers. The industry size of single-use plastics is estimated to be ₹10,000 crore. This has been positive news for paper industry as the opportunity to replace the single use plastic with paper has been huge. However, currently, India lag on require infrastructure to entirely replace the single use plastic. For example, India consume about 6 billion of plastic straws every year which need to replace with paper straw and currently, India does not have domestic manufacturing capacity for this.   Oil prices fell on Wednesday, taking a break after gaining for three sessions, as concerns about the global economy weighed while tight supply curbed losses.

The August contract will expire on Thursday and the more-active September contract was at $113.03, down 77 cents, or 0.7%. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures slid 62 cents, or 0.6%, to $111.14 a barrel. Both contracts rose more than 2% on Tuesday as concerns over tight supplies due to Western sanctions on Russia outweighed fears of that demand may slow in a potential future recession.   Copper prices slipped on Wednesday, as downbeat U.S. consumer confidence data and prospects of rapid rate hikes to control a surge in inflation fanned fears of a global economic slowdown, impacting metals demand. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was down 0.6% at $8,314 a tonne, as of 0702 GMT. Prices of the metal, which is used as a gauge of economic health by investors, has fallen 23% since scaling a peak of $10,845 in March. The most-traded August copper contract in Shanghai ended daytime trading down 0.9% to 63,470 yuan ($9,466.07) a tonne. LME aluminium fell 0.7% to $2,474 a tonne, zinc gained 0.2% to $3,340, lead dipped 0.7% to $1,956.50, nickel shed 1.6% to $22,800, and tin dropped 7.1% to $24,900.   Stocks dropped Wednesday on renewed worries about economic growth as monetary policy tightens in much of the world to fight inflation. European equities fell for the first time in four days with sentiment also hurt by China remaining committed to its zero-Covid approach. US contracts steadied after a tech-led slide hurt the S&P 500 Tuesday. An Asian equity index snapped a four-day climb, losing more than 1%.   Enterprise communications service provider Route Mobile's board has approved the buyback by the company of its fully paid-up equity shares at a price not exceeding ₹1,700 per equity share (Maximum Buyback Price) and for an aggregate amount not exceeding ₹120 crore (maximum buyback size), from the shareholders of the company, excluding promoters, promoter group and persons who are in control of the company.   Although global growth expectations have moderated recently, the structural demand drivers for commodities like steel remain intact, said Sajjan Jindal, chairman and managing director of JSW Steel Ltd in a message to shareholders in the company’s annual report.   We tweak our FY23/24E earnings lower by ~1%. IGL reported strong results with EBIDTA/PAT of Rs5.0bn (6%Q/Q; PLe Rs3.9bn) and Rs3.6bn (16%Q/Q; PLe Rs2.7bn), due to higher margins given lower spot purchase. Volumes were lower QoQ partly due to pandemic restrictions in January and were at 7.7mscmd (-1%Q/Q). For FY22, EBIDTA/PAT was at Rs18.8bn (+11% 2yr CAGR) and Rs13.1bn (2yr CAGR 7.7%). We believe pick-up in economic activity will drive growth in coming quarters. IGL remains an enviable business model with high volume growth due to geographical expansion and addition of new buses and taxis. Also, fuel economics, shift to private vehicle ownership post pandemic will drive CNG volumes despite excise duty cuts, in our view. Reiterate “BUY"" with DCF-based PT of Rs589 (Rs662) as we raise the WACC to 10.3% from 9.7%.   “NYMEX crude trades marginally lower near $111/bbl after recovering nearly 10% from recent lows. Crude oil rose in last few days on supply concerns as G7 members worked on ways to cap Russian crude prices, Libya and Ecuador faced supply disruptions due to political issues and as some major producers like UAE indicated that they were producing near capacity. The momentum is crude oil however came to a halt as disappointing US economic data rekindled demand concerns and as market players positioned for weekly inventory report. Crude may remain choppy ahead of inventory report however lack of any positive surprise may result in some profit taking.""   “COMEX gold trades in a range near $1820/oz as support from disappointing US economic data, ban on Russian gold imports by some G7 countries, sharp rebound in crude oil price and improving outlook for Chinese economy is countered by rebound in US dollar index, attempts at recovery by equity markets, continuing ETF outflows and monetary tightening stance of major central banks. Gold remains stuck in the $1800-1850/oz and this may continue amid lack of fresh triggers however with Fed’s emphasis on aggressive tightening, the US dollar may remain supported keeping pressure on gold prices..""   We downgrade MM to HOLD with revised DCF-based target price of Rs1,150 (earlier: Rs1,065), implying 15x FY24E core earnings and discounted value of stake in various listed entities. Under present business visibility, we see limited scope for further earnings upgrades, resulting in limited upside on present valuation levels, post MM having given ~60% return in past three months.   IRCTC share price: Shares of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation rally took a pause today after surging on last three successive sessions. IRCTC share price today opened downside and went to hit intraday low of ₹609.30 per share mark on NSE in early morning deals, logging around 1.50 per cent dip from its Tuesday close of ₹620 per share levels.   Asian stock markets fell on Wednesday, extending Wall Street's overnight losses amid concerns over inflation and the possibility of recession, which also boosted the safe-haven dollar. Japan's Nikkei index fell 0.98%, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.37%, dragged lower by Australian shares, off 0.81%, and Korea's KOSPI, down 1.54%. Asian shares had ended the Tuesday session on an upward trajectory after China announced an easing of its quarantine requirements for inbound passengers, in what some observers saw as the biggest relaxation so far of its ""zero COVID"" strategy. But the positive impact had petered out on Wednesday. ""Inevitably, markets tend to overreact to these sorts of news,"" said Carlos Casanova, senior economist at UBP in Hong Kong. ""In order for that to be sustainable, we really want to see these measures materialise into actual reopening."" Chinese blue chips, which hit a four month high the day before, lost 1.16% while the Hong Kong benchmark fell 1.83%.  EUROSTOXX 50 futures were down 0.57% and FTSE futures lost 0.68% before European markets opened. The losses in Asia followed a turbulent day on US markets, with the S&P 500 index down more than 2% after data showed US consumer confidence dropped to a 16-month low in June due to fears high inflation could cause the economy to slow significantly in the second half of the year.   Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani stepped down on Tuesday from the role of director of the telecoms arm of Reliance Industries in favour of his son Akash, setting the stage for a leadership transition at his energy-to-retail conglomerate. The change was disclosed in a regulatory filing by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which said Mukesh's 30-year-old son and non-executive director Akash was being appointed chairman of the board. The move comes after Ambani, who ranks among the world's top 10 billionaires, first signaled last year that his children would have significant roles in the family's business empire. Reliance is ""in the process of effecting a momentous leadership transition,"" he said at an event in December. Akash's twin sister Isha is a director on the boards of Jio as well as Reliance Retail, which houses the conglomerate's ambitious bets in India's brick-and-mortar space. The youngest of the siblings, Anant, sits on the board of renewable energy and oil and chemical units of Reliance as a director.   We re-iterate BUY on Century Plyboards (CPBI) as demand continues to remain healthy for wood panel products. Our recent interaction with dealers and the management of Century Plyboards (CPBI) indicates that in the currently ongoing Q1FY23, demand trends are steady across segments like plywood, laminates and MDF on continued pick-up in residential market and higher spend on home improvement post the pandemic. CPBI has taken price increase of ~2-4% in plywood segment and ~3-4% in laminates during Q1FY23, which should enable it to mitigate the raw material price pressures and thus, enable margin to remain steady going ahead. CPBI management had earlier guided for 15-25% revenue growth across segments in FY23. We maintain estimates and our BUY rating on the stock with an unchanged Mar’23E target price of Rs747.   We reiterate our BUY ratings on Indian Hotels Co. Ltd. (IHCL) and Lemon Tree Hotels (LTH). For IHCL, we have a target price of Rs284/share, valuing the stock at 22x Jun’24E EV/EBITDA. For LTH, we have a target price of Rs84/share, valuing the stock at 20x Mar’24E EV/EBITDA.   Shares of Century Plyboards India Ltd have been under pressure recently, after scaling a new 52-week high of ₹749 in March. Concerns about persistent high raw material inflation have weighed on investor sentiment for the stock. So far in this calendar year, the stock has corrected by around 15% on the National Stock Exchange.   After the G-7 leaders agreed to curb Russian oil imports to limit the energy proceeds that Kremlin uses to finance its war machines in Ukraine the country's fuel prices have gone up due to strong demand from Asia. But should India be worried?   Domestic brokerage and research firm IIFL has retained its positive stance on Deepak Fertilisers shares, as at 10x FY23ii P/E, it continues to find valuations attractive. While nitric-acid realisations and spreads are expected to sustain in FY23, TAN spreads may soften. Thus, EPS growth in FY23 is expected to be muted, the brokerage highlighted in a note.   Traders in India’s foreign-exchange market are bracing for more instances of dollar shortages, as record outflows from the nation’s equities and deteriorating external finances bite. Some Mumbai-based banks saw a dollar crunch last week, as outflows from Indian assets add to the pressure, according to Mizuho Bank Ltd. and IFA Global. The rupee dropped to a record low against the greenback on Wednesday. Foreign investors have pulled $28 billion from Indian equities this year, while higher oil import costs and a widening current account deficit mean that everybody from investors to companies are demanding dollar for their rupee at the same time. The Reserve Bank of India said last Friday it’s trying to meet the demand through its reserves.   Rakesh Jhunjhunwala portfolio: After climbing to life-time high of ₹268.95 on NSE in April 2022, Indian Hotels Company shares are under base building phase. However, the stock has a history of giving strong return to its shareholders in long term. In last 20 years, this Rakesh Jhunjhunwala stock has ascended from ₹13.85 to ₹228.10 apiece levels, giving compound annual growth rate or CAGR of near 15 per cent over this period of two decades.   Isha Ambani is set to be named chairman of the Reliance conglomerate’s retail unit in another sign that her father, Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, is pushing ahead with a plan for succession in one of Asia’s richest families.   Stock market of India has been under sell-off heat after the outbreak of Russia-Ukraine war. In YTD time, both Nifty and Sensex have corrected more than 10 per cent whereas small-cap index has corrected over 16 per cent in 2022. So, positional investors looking for value picks available at discounted price may get lured towards small-cap stocks for higher returns when the market rebounds.   Domestic equity indices declined substantially in the opening session of Wednesday due to consistent depreciation of rupee, foreign fund outflows, prevailing inflation concerns, among others. Indian currency rupee has been consistently hitting fresh all-time lows. The renewed rise in global crude oil prices too have a negative bearing on the market sentiments, said analysts. On Tuesday, the indices closed steady, while they have declined during the majority of the sessions so far in June. At 10.00 a.m on Wednesday, Sensex was at 52,844.78 points, down 332.67 points or 0.63%, whereas Nifty at 15,749.35 points, down 100.85 points or 0.64%.   The Indian rupee weakened further on Wednesday, touching record lows against the U.S. dollar as losses in domestic shares and other Asian currencies weighed on sentiment. The partially convertible rupee was trading at 78.94/95 per dollar by 0409 GMT, after touching a lifetime low of 78.95. The currency closed at 78.77 on Tuesday. Traders said the rupee could weaken towards 79 per dollar during the session, but the central bank is expected to intervene to slow the slide in the currency.   2Wheeler stocks have outperformed Nifty by 11-33% since Feb 2022 . However, stocks have still lagged Nifty by 33-77% since Jan 2018 due to demand downturn and EV concern. While the latter concern will continue until clarity on EV market shares emerges, Jefferies believes stocks are attractive for the impending demand recovery.   Stocks dropped in Asia on Wednesday on renewed worries about a gloomy economic outlook as monetary policy tightens in much of the world to fight high inflation. An Asian equity index snapped a four-day climb, shedding more than 1%. US futures steadied after a tech-led tumble in the S&P 500 on Tuesday. Institutional portfolio rebalancing may be impacting trading. China’s bourses were in the red too but the losses were relatively modest. In a surprise move, the nation Tuesday reduced quarantine times for inbound travelers. That hinted at an eventual shift away from a strategy of stamping out Covid that involves great economic cost via lockdowns and travel curbs.   A total of two stocks have been put under the ban for trade on Wednesday, June 29, 2022 under the futures and options (F&O) segment by the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The securities have been put on ban under the F&O segment as they have crossed 95% of the market-wide position limit (MWPL), as per the NSE.   Adani Power shares are one of the multibagger stocks in 2022 that Indian stock market has produced despite global economy reeling under the pressure of inflation and gloomy economy outlook. In YTD time, Adani Power share price has surged from around ₹101 to ₹270 apiece levels on NSE, recording around 165 per cent rise in 2022. However, this multibagger Adani stock has a history of delivering staggering return to its shareholders.

Shares of the firm slumped 11% to $55.96 on Monday, extending their decline this year to 78% as Bitcoin trades at less than half its value from just six months ago. Goldman analyst William Nance cited the “continued downdraft in crypto prices"" and the broader drop in activity levels across the industry. Coinbase had fallen 75% this year prior to the downgrade.   The rupee plunged by 48 paise to close at record low of 78.85 (provisional) against the US dollar on Tuesday, weighed down by persistent foreign capital outflows and a surge in crude oil prices. At the interbank foreign exchange market, the rupee opened lower at 78.53 against the greenback and finally settled at 78.85, down 48 paise over its previous close. During the session, the rupee touched an all-time low of 78.8550 against the American currency.   The dollar climbed on Tuesday while the euro faltered after European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde offered no fresh insight into the central bank's policy outlook. The ECB is widely expected to follow its global peers by raising interest rates in July to try to check soaring inflation though economists are divided on the magnitude of any rate hike. The euro held below $1.06 after Lagarde said the central bank would move gradually but with the option to act decisively on any deterioration in medium-term inflation, especially if there were signs of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations.   Gold inched down on Wednesday in range-bound trading, as sustained strength in the dollar kept investors away from greenback-priced bullion.

Oil prices fell on Wednesday after rising in the previous three sessions but losses were limited on the view that global supply tightness will continue as there is limited room for major producers such as Saudi Arabia to boost production.

The business research group’s expectations index, based on consumers’ six-month outlook for income, business and labour market conditions, tumbled in June to 66.4 — its lowest level since 2013.

Equities fell in Japan, Australia and South Korea. US futures steadied after the S&P 500 sank and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 shed over 3%. Monthly and quarterly institutional portfolio rebalancing may be impacting trading. The dollar held gains after rising the most in more than a week in the Wall Street session amid disquiet over evaporating US consumer confidence. Treasuries were steady, leaving the 10-year yield at 3.18%. The risk of an American recession overshadowed China’s surprise move Tuesday to reduce quarantine times for inbound travelers. The step had lifted markets on hopes of a shift away from a strategy of stamping out Covid that comes with great economic cost via repeated lockdowns. Oil pushed past $112 a barrel on supply risks. In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin wallowed around $20,000 amid generally poor sentiment.   Tokyo stocks opened lower on Wednesday, extending falls on Wall Street as a gloomy US consumer confidence report offset positive news about China's move to scale back Covid-19 restrictions. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was down 0.67 percent, or 235.88 points, at 26,813.59 in early trade, while the broader Topix index slipped 0.79 percent, or 14.98 points, to 1,892.40.

That dragged the S&P/ASX 200 index down 1.2% to 6,681.1 by 0053 GMT, and putting it on track to snap a four-day winning streak. The benchmark had added 0.9% in the previous session.   Hong Kong stocks tumbled more than one percent in the opening minutes of trade Wednesday following a sharp sell-off on Wall Street fuelled by concerns about the impact of runaway inflation on the economy. The Hang Seng Index sank 1.31 percent, or 293.36 points, to 22,125.61. The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.28 percent, or 9.53 points, to 3,399.68, while the Shenzhen Composite Index on China's second exchange also fell 0.28 percent, or 6.38 points, to 2,237.54.   Wall Street closed sharply lower in a broad sell-off on Tuesday as dire consumer confidence data dampened investor optimism and fueled worries over recession and the looming earnings season. The S&P and the Nasdaq fell about 2% and 3% respectively, with Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com weighing the heaviest. The blue-chip Dow shed about 1.6%. ""Markets were fine today until the consumer confidence number came out,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""It was weak and markets immediately began selling off."" With the end of the month and the second quarter two days away, the benchmark S&P 500 is on track for its biggest first-half percentage drop since 1970. All three indexes are on course to notch two straight quarterly declines for the first time since 2015.

Asian stock markets were mixed while Europe opened higher ahead of a Federal Reserve decision on how sharply to raise interest rates to cool U.S. inflation. London, Frankfurt and Shanghai advanced. Tokyo and Sydney declined. Oil prices edged lower. Wall Street futures were higher after the benchmark S&P 500 index lost 0.4% on Tuesday.  India’s benchmark indices ended lower for the fourth straight day on Wednesday, having swung between gains and losses through the session. Investors were largely focussed on the US Federal Reserve’s policy announcement, due later today. Traders expect the Fed rate hike to be three-quarters of a percentage point, or triple the usual margin. They worry aggressive action to cool inflation that is running at a four-decade high might tip the  world's largest economy into recession. US index futures gained along with stocks in Europe as policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic grapple with soaring inflation, slowing economic growth and volatile markets. Back home, Sensex fell 152.18 points to end the day at 52,541.39, while the broader Nifty shed 39.95 points to close at 15,692.15.

Global oil demand will return to pre-pandemic levels next year as China's consumption recovers from Covid lockdowns, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday. Soaring oil prices and weaker economic growth will temper the growth of demand in the second half of this year, said the Paris-based agency. But ""resurgent Chinese oil consumption will more than compensate for a slowdown"" in oil demand among the 38-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that gathers mostly developed countries, the IEA said. China has enforced a zero-Covid policy that has led to lockdowns in Shanghai, its economic hub. The IEA expects global oil demand to grow to 99.4 million barrels per day in 2022 -- higher than its previous estimates but still one million barrels lower than in 2019. Demand is set to grow to 101.6 million barrels per day in 2023, according to the IEA, which advises developed countries on energy policy.   Nifty June series continues to trade with a negative bias – no strong reversal confirmation seen yet. Short term momentum parameters also suggest possibility of high volatility in the near term coinciding with the Fed decision on interest rates. Critical medium term trend support is seen at 15500 below which trend gets challenged. Advice being extremely selective for the near term.   DMRC has invited bids from 18 banks to raise loan to the tune of ₹2,700 cr for ""purchase of Airport Line assets,"" according to letters sent to these banks by the urban transporter.

Shares of Tata Communications Ltd. slid to a new 52-week low of Rs856.25 on the NSE, on Wednesday after the company’s growth plans failed to enthuse its investors.

The company has maintained its medium-term RoCE (return on capital employed) and operating margin guidance at 25-30% and 23-25%, respectively. However, no timeline was shared on its revenue growth target, which was a key disappointment. (Read here)   US index futures gained before a crucial Federal Reserve policy decision later Wednesday, with markets pricing in the biggest rate hike since 1994. Treasury yields dipped and the dollar retreated from a two-year high.  Stocks in Europe climbed, the euro strengthened and the region’s bonds advanced after the European Central Bank said it’s planning an unscheduled meeting Wednesday to tackle volatile market conditions. Officials will sign off on the reinvestment of bond purchases conducted under the now-halted pandemic emergency program.   As India faces a crippling surge in food and fuel prices, its policymakers will be counting mostly on this year's monsoon rains, not just interest rate hikes, to take inflationary pressure off the country's households and businesses.  Like its international peers, the Reserve Bank of India is expected to raise rates aggressively over the next year to take some of the heat out of prices, but the global drivers of the country's inflation mean there are limits to what domestic monetary policy can achieve, analysts say.  With 75% of India's price acceleration expected to come from food items, the focus for central bankers will be on the success of monsoon rains to boost production and replenish stockpiles, which would ease supply constraints and anchor price expectations. (Read here)   The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has ordered a four-month suspension in exports and re-exports of wheat and wheat flour originating from India, the world's second biggest producer of the grain, state news agency WAM said on Wednesday.

India's merchandise exports in May rose by 20.55% to $38.94 billion, while trade deficit ballooned to a record $24.29 billion, according to the government data. Imports during May 2022 grew 62.83% on year to $63.22 billion, as per the data. Trade deficit stood at $6.53 billion in the same month last year. Cumulative exports in April-May rose about 25% to $78.72 billion, while imports during the period increased 45.4% to $123.41 billion.   Fitch Ratings expects India’s cement demand to rise by mid-to-high single digits over the medium term. This is after an estimated mid-teen rebound in the financial year ended March 2022 (FY22) from FY21 when demand declined by mid-single digits amid the Covid-19 pandemic.  We believe sustained GDP growth after the 8.7% recovery in FY22 will underpin growth across various construction end-markets. We expect cement demand from infrastructure and affordable housing markets to increase by low double digits, largely on the government’s growing impetus, evident from rising public spending and a significant project pipeline.  The rebound in urban housing activity in the last few quarters from multi-year cyclical lows will be sustained, in our view, leading to mid-to-high single-digit cement sales growth from the end-market. Similarly, a revival in corporate capex after a focus on cash conservation during 2020-2021 will support growth in industrial construction.  The impact of inflationary pressure on cement demand from the Russia-Ukraine war has been limited so far, but downside risks to our estimates will rise if macroeconomic conditions deteriorate significantly. We estimate the price hikes by cement producers will not fully counter the spike in energy prices since the start of the war. This will lead to markedly lower profitability in the April-June 2022 quarter.   GR Infraprojects has built an efficient business model powered by robust execution skills and delivered strong revenue growth with elevated margins.

Apollo Hospitals consolidated EBIDTA grew by 11% to Rs4.1bn, below our estimate of Rs4.9bn, impacted by lower profitability in hospital segment and higher losses from 24x7. We expect hospital profitability to normalize from Q1FY23 while losses from 24x7 likely to remain at elevated levels in FY23.  We estimate 20% EBITDA CAGR over FY22-24E. Our FY23E & FY24E EBIDTA stands reduced by 11% and 7% as we factor in higher losses from 24x7. We value APHS on an SOTP basis. We ascribe 22x EV/EBITDA multiple to the hospital segment, 30x EV/EBITDA to offline pharmacy and 20x EV/EBITDA to AHLL. We ascribe zero value to the 24/7 business and arrive at a price target of Rs5,000 (Rs5,772 earlier). Recommend BUY rating.   The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday approved a proposal of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to conduct spectrum auction through which spectrum will be assigned to successful bidders for providing 5G services to public and enterprises. Digital connectivity has been an important part of policy initiatives of Government through its flagship programs such as Digital India, Start-up India, Make in India etc. A total of 72097.85 MHz of spectrum with a validity period of 20 years will be put to auction to be held by the end of July 2022. The auction will be held for spectrum in various Low (600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz), Mid (3300 MHz) and High (26 GHz) frequency bands. It is expected that the mid- and high-band spectrum will be utilised by telecom service providers to rollout 5G technology-based services capable of providing speed and capacities which would be about 10 times higher than what is possible through the current 4G services. There will no mandatory requirement to make upfront payment by successful bidders. Payments for spectrum can be made in 20 equal annual instalments to be paid in advance at the beginning of each year. This is expected to significantly ease cash flow requirements and lower the cost of doing business in this sector.

The NCLAT said ""the appellant Amazon has not made full, whole, forthright and frank disclosures of relevant materials. It had furnished only limited disclosures pertaining to acquiring its strategic rights and interest in FRL (Future Retail Ltd)"" and executing the commercial contract. In December, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had suspended the approval given by it in 2019, for Amazon's deal to acquire a 49% in Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL). The regulator had said Amazon suppressed information while seeking clearances for the transaction back then and also slapped a fine of ₹202 crore on the company.

We model Voltas to report revenue and PAT CAGRs of 15.3% and 24.2% over FY22- FY24E, driven by: (1) high single-digit price hikes, and (2) likely market share recovery.  At current valuations, we believe stock price upside is capped. Hence, we maintain HOLD rating with a DCF-based target price of Rs1,033 (implied P/E 44x FY24E).   Weakness was seen in the equity market across the globe, led by higher-than-expected inflation data in the US market, leading to a rise in the bond yields. US bond yields are now trading above 3.15% levels, indicating the aggressive rate hike expectation by the US FED in the upcoming FOMC meeting, scheduled this week. The market is now eyeing the outcome of the FED meeting, and how the central bank influences the path of interest rates trajectory to maintain growth and inflation dynamics. In the domestic market, India's VIX rose by 11% led by weaker global cues, a stronger dollar, and the expectation of Hawkish commentary by the US FED. FII behaviour is likely to be volatile this week, and a clear trend is likely to emerge only after the volatility settles at a lower level for a longer time. Investors should focus on the asset allocation and use this volatility in a calibrated manner to build long-term positions in quality companies, where the earnings visibility is high.   Mumbai-based Keystone Realtors Ltd, which operates under the ‘Rustomjee’ brand, has filed a draft red herring prospectus with Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to raise up to ₹850 crore via an initial public offering (IPO). The initial share sale comprises a fresh issue of ₹700 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of up to ₹150 crore by its existing shareholders and promoters. The OFS consists of up to ₹75 crore worth share sale by chairman and managing director Boman Rustom Irani, up to ₹37.50 crore by Percy Soraji Chowdhry, and up to ₹37.50 crore by Chandresh Dinesh Mehta.   Of the nearly 81 World Trade Organization member countries, led by Singapore, seeking a ban on export restrictions for the World Food Programme at the ongoing ministerial underway in Geneva, most have not contributed to the United Nation’s programme, as per data. Although India has been opposing such a move to restrict its policy space to ensure domestic food security, it contributes to the WFP, and in fact was the highest contributor in 2015.

The company boasts of several popular brands including Relaxo, Sparx, Flite, and the Bahamas which stand as leaders in their respective domains. Its product mix comprises Hawai and Bahamas which account for ~25% of total sales value (60% shoes & 40% sandals) while Flite and Sparks account for ~37% of total sales each.  · Open footwear on a recovery track: The company’s Q4FY22 performance stood tepid, especially for the open footwear category (~75-80% of Relaxo’s sales). On a positive note, its closed footwear reported robust recovery on account of the opening of schools, colleges, and work offices. We believe a significant pent up demand will be released as the rural economy revives, thereby benefiting the company’s operating performance moving forward.  · Key catalyst: Normal Monsoon, Higher MSP: Normal monsoon forecast, the recent announcement of a hike in MSP, and higher remittances will be key catalysts aiding in the revival of the rural economy, which in turn, will kick-start the overall consumption cycle.  · Low pressure on profitability: Hyper-inflation in key raw material prices, coupled with subdued volume growth, has been posing pressure on profits. However, we believe the company’s margins are likely to inch up going forward as the pick-up in the volumes and market share gains from the unorganized/smaller players trigger operating leverage.  · Superior financial matrix: Relaxo has maintained healthy operating cash flow and asset turns. Moreover, its robust EBITDA Margins over the years have made it one of the most capital-efficient businesses in the industry. We believe a strong balance sheet with zero net debt and efficient working capital should help Relaxo prosper in the long run.  Recommendation: We recommend a BUY on the stock with a near-term TP of ₹1,100/share implying an upside of 11% from the CMP.

India and other Asian nations are becoming an increasingly vital source of oil revenues for Moscow despite strong pressure from the U.S. not to increase their purchases, as the European Union and other allies cut off energy imports from Russia in line with sanctions over its war on Ukraine. Such sales are boosting Russian export revenues at a time when Washington and allies are trying to limit financial flows supporting Moscow's war effort. India, an oil-hungry country of 1.4 billion people, has guzzled nearly 60 million barrels of Russian oil in 2022 so far, compared with 12 million barrels in all of 2021, according to commodity data firm Kpler.

These levels are finally broken which has negated the minor upward trend that emerged during the previous week after surpassing the 16400 mark. The market is unable to show any kind of strength at higher levels; but despite this, we are still not getting convinced with the weakness. We would rather reassess the situation in the first half of this week and all eyes on crucial levels like 16000 on the lower side and 16400 on the upside. The pragmatic strategy would be to stay light on positions and stock specific also, we are seeing a lot of whipsaws on either side. In fact, it has become a nightmare in trading stocks in the last couple of weeks. Let’s see how things pan out going ahead and we are still hopeful of some recovery in the coming days.

Updated: 09 Jun 2022,7 steps to get the best interest rate on a personal loan with Bajaj Finserv,https://www.livemint.com/brand-stories/7-steps-to-get-the-best-interest-rate-on-a-personal-loan-with-bajaj-finserv-11654752723893.html,"A personal loan is a swift and convenient tool to manage various financial needs, especially those that crop up without notice. You can use an online personal loan even for planned expenditures, such as remodelling your home, educational expenses, or even a vacation. Sometimes, it does not make sense to dip into your savings for certain big-ticket expenses. The ideal way to finance your immediate cash requirements is by availing yourself of the lowest interest rate personal loan from Bajaj Finserv. Once you have figured out the amount you need, use a loan EMI calculator to determine your monthly repayments. Here are 7 steps that will help you get a personal loan at the lowest interest rate from Bajaj Finserv: 1. Clearly define your personal loan requirement Before opting for the lowest interest personal loan, finalise the amount you need and figure out a comfortable monthly repayment amount depending on your income. You can even mix and match. For instance, if you need a sum of Rs. 4 lakh, but the EMI is turning out to be quite high, you may choose to use Rs. 1 lakh from your savings to reduce the loan/EMI amount. The fine line between a higher loan and sparing your savings vs a lesser loan and eating into your savings is one you must walk alone. When in doubt, use an online loan EMI calculator. 2. Visit the Bajaj Finserv website Once you have an approximate figure in mind, visit the Bajaj Finserv website and check out the online personal loan offers. Bajaj Finserv offers personal loans ranging up to Rs. 25 lakh. The tenors on lowest interest personal loans vary from 24 months (2 years) to 60 months (5 years). If you have a good credit score and a solid income, you can get the most competitive interest rate on your online personal loan. The interest rates usually start at around 13%. Once again, key in all your loan information into a loan EMI calculator to better understand the offer. 3. Check your personal loan eligibility Unless you fulfil all the eligibility criteria, getting the lowest interest personal loan is tough. Before applying for an online personal loan from Bajaj Finserv, browse their portal for information on the eligibility criteria such as the age, minimum monthly income, credit score and work experience. You must always keep all the required documentation ready before applying for a personal loan. A higher credit score will allow you to get the lowest interest rates on your personal loan no matter which lending institution you approach. 4. Maintain a high CIBIL score Your CIBIL score is an indicator of your repayment history. A CIBIL score of over 750 is viewed most favourably by banks and financial institutions, and applicants with these scores are sure to get the lowest rate personal loans without much trouble. Even if your credit score is north of 700, you stand a decent chance of availing yourself of a competitive personal loan offer, but below 700 is where things get tricky. We suggest you make all your credit card/ loan payments in time to build an impressive credit score before applying for a new loan. 5. Compare interest rates online If you meet all the eligibility criteria and have a 750+ credit score, you can get an online personal loan from Bajaj Finserv at an interest rate of just 13%. However, the interest rate can also climb higher if your repayment ability is questionable. Using a loan EMI calculator, you can better understand the loan variables (such as interest rate and tenor) and how they influence your repayment obligation. 6. Fill out the personal loan application form Once you are satisfied with the online personal loan details available on the Bajaj Finserv website, you can initiate the application process by filling out the online form. Apart from KYC details such as Aadhaar and PAN, you must also provide your income data along with relevant documents such as salary slips and bank statements. Ensure that you enter all the details correctly and submit the softcopies where needed. The online application process is simple and seamless, and you can get it done in very little time. On submission, you will receive an OTP on your registered mobile number. Once you key in the OTP, your application is registered and is in the processing stage. 7. Await the disbursal Your Bajaj Finserv Personal Loan application usually gets processed within a short time. However, if your documentation is on point and you meet all the eligibility criteria, you can get the loan amount disbursed in just a few hours. Taking the lowest interest personal loan for managing personal finances or consolidating your debts is probably the best financial decision that you can make. This is because personal loans are disbursed quickly and do not require you to keep any collateral as security. However, you need to be aware of certain factors, such as your credit score, because having a minimum credit score of 750 is a must for getting an online personal loan. Keep these factors in mind, and you will not have to face any issues while opting for the lowest interest rate personal loan.

Avail small personal loans from Bajaj Finserv,https://www.livemint.com/brand-stories/looking-for-easy-finance-options-avail-small-personal-loans-from-bajaj-finserv-11653292958373.html,"Personal loans are a great way of taking care of immediate financial needs. However, there are also times when your requirements are small (but urgent), and the best personal loans don’t seem like the ideal option. Most lending institutions offer personal loans for a minimum of Rs. 2 lakh. But what if you need a smaller sum of money? It does not make sense to go for a loan amount higher than what is your immediate requirement. You don't have to bear the interest burden on an extra loan amount you don’t need. This is where small personal loans come in as a lifesaver as they are available for amounts as less as Rs. 10,000. Before applying for a small personal loan, you should use a personal loan interest calculator or an EMI calculator to establish your precise monthly repayment obligation. Reasons for taking a small personal loan - Small personal loans are taken for meeting urgent but small financial needs. - Small personal loans are often preferred by candidates with no or poor credit scores (since a personal loan approval requires a minimum credit score of 750). - You can get a small personal loan even with a bad credit score. - You can apply for the precise loan amount you need without going extra. - A small personal loan will help you avoid the extra interest on a high amount personal loan Leading lenders like Bajaj Finserv also offer small personal loans to cover an extensive range of financial needs such as buying a home appliance, remodeling your kitchen, setting up an in-house workstation, etc. Small personal loans usually range from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 2 lakh. Although these fall in the category of the best personal loans, they are granted immediately and come with relaxed eligibility criteria. You can negotiate with your bank over the interest rates and eligibility criteria when applying for a small personal loan. Features of Bajaj Finserv Small Personal Loan - Bajaj Finserv small personal loans are facilitated through their EMI cards, such as Insta EMI Card and EMI Network Card. - Users of the Bajaj Finserv EMI Network card must only pay specific fees instead of the interest. - The charges include a convenience fee, add-on card fee (optional), loan enhancement fee (optional), mandate registration charges, cheque bounce charges, annual fee, and penalties for late payment. - Bajaj Finserv small personal loans are often provided to customers when buying equipment/appliances from partner stores. Bajaj Finserv Small Personal Loan eligibility The eligibility criteria for a Bajaj Finserv Personal Loan are as follows: - Minimum age of 21 years and maximum age of 67 years* - Minimum and maximum salary limit (depends on the place of residence of the borrower) - Minimum work experience of 1-3 years - Fixed monthly/annual income with proof - Complete documentation - KYC documents, ITR, salary slips, bank statements, etc. Benefits of getting a Bajaj Finserv Small Personal Loan - No need for collateral - Hassle-free online application process - Quick approval and disbursal of the loan amount (within 1 business day) - Lower interest rates and low EMIs - No minimum credit score required - Fast credit score build-up - Relaxed eligibility criteria and repayment tenor - 24/7 customer support - Pre-qualification also available As detailed above, small personal loans are an efficient tool for financing relatively small financial needs. These are the best personal loans for salaried individuals who do not want to be burdened by a huge personal loan with a longer tenor. Even low-income salaried individuals are eligible for small personal loans. Getting a small personal loan is easy as the eligibility criteria are relatively relaxed and no minimum credit score is required. Before applying for a small personal loan, we suggest you access an EMI calculator or personal loan interest calculator to figure out your potential monthly installments.

Businesses in the formal sector, especially technology firms, are steadily hiring people, said Bajaj, also the chairman and managing director of Bajaj Finserv Ltd. A normal monsoon will help tame food price inflation, while tax cuts could help moderate energy price inflation, Bajaj said in an interview, adding that businesses are expecting clues from the Reserve Bank of India on the roadmap for the expected monetary tightening.  Edited excerpts:    Retail price inflation has surged to an eight-year high in April. What is the impact on industry? Will it drag down consumption? Multiple factors are impacting the economy now. There are uncertainties around the war (in Eastern Europe), besides the disruption in the global supply chain. Hopefully, the pandemic is less of an uncertainty now, but we never know. We have seen that companies have been absorbing part of their input costs. You will see some of it getting transmitted outside. From a common man’s point of view, two big costs are the costs of food and fuel. On fuel, we recommend that both the Centre and states in a collaborative manner cut taxes so that it benefits individuals immediately. Secondly, many parts of India are facing a heatwave and early signs are that we may see again a good normal monsoon. If that happens, food price (inflation) will abate. We have also seen in the last couple of quarters, reasonably strong growth on consumer demand. It may moderate a bit, but we are not overly concerned about it at this juncture. As long as we address fuel and food (inflation), we should be in a reasonably okay situation.  To cool food inflation, what more can be done by the government? Other than the measures taken, we are waiting for the monsoon. The government will have to be nimble on policies so that action is taken as required because there are so many factors—external and internal, which keep varying. We also believe that rural India, those that are linked to agriculture, are seeing better minimum support price (MSP); so with the harvest season coming, they should be doing okay, but in the non-agriculture sector, the rural population will need some amount of fiscal support. That is something the government will have to continue to do.  When do you expect private investment to take off? In the last two-three years, we did not see significant increase in new investment in the private sector because demand was down and there were uncertainties during the pandemic. If there are uncertainties and people do not have confidence, then we do not see people raising money. We have now seen a large amount of deleveraging of balance sheets. In the last year, we have seen some sectors starting new investment cycles, not only in commodities and chemicals, but also in real estate and housing and in transportation. Overall, capacity utilization has crossed 70% and when it starts crossing 75-80%, you will see the new investment cycle. What we need now is a boost of confidence and we believe that as long as there is nothing more on the pandemic side and the war comes to a reasonable resolution or to an acceptable situation, such that confidence comes back, that will create the additional tailwind for private sector investment.  How will the policy rate increases by the RBI impact businesses and the non-bank lending sector? Given where inflation is, and keeping in mind that in the few years to the pandemic, central banks all over the world expanded liquidity and lowered rates, it is a reversal of that cycle. It is a sensible and expected action. To that extent, we may see a few more rate hikes. What we hope to see in RBI’s next policy review is some kind of roadmap of triggers they are watching out for to help them decide the extent and timing of the rate hikes. Because if the industry understands the roadmap, we can align ourselves to that. We are still far away from the normalization of the rates. You will see some impact. I do not think we do not have to be too worried about growth. Is the NBFC sector out of the woods? The pressure mainly again came through the pandemic and the disruptions it created. That is why the central bank has been very supportive with some of the direct lines it opened up to the NBFCs and encouraged banks to lend to NBFCs as well. Now, things are getting normalized. You are actually seeing many NBFCs coming out with strong results. A number of them are becoming as strong as mid-sized banks. Recognizing that, the RBI has brought in a tighter regulatory structure for NBFCs, which also makes a lot of sense. You are seeing NBFCs as almost a stepping stone to becoming a bank. This is something that the RBI should think more proactively as we need to increase banking services in the country."

In the formal sector, we are seeing steady hiring now. In the technology sector, there is a huge demand for people. Attrition levels are high and there are a large number of vacancies. But we believe the change in geopolitics in the last few years has opened up two big windows of opportunity for India. One is for us to become the manufacturing hub for the world for all the things we end up buying from overseas. That is where polices of the Centre on land, labour and energy can make a very big difference in setting the right foundation for the industry to grow. Government has offered production linked incentives and we will recommend a few more sectors where we can be world leaders, for this incentive. Also, employment linked incentives can be given in sectors such as footwear, furniture, leather products and tourism which can employ tens of millions of people. Also, as we have seen in the case of GST, the Centre and states can come together for policy making in land, energy and labour."
Updated: 17 May 2022,Centre-state tie-up can cut fuel taxes: Bajaj,https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/centrestate-tie-up-can-cut-fuel-taxes-bajaj-11652723673334.html,"Central and state governments should collaborate to cut taxes on petrol and diesel in order to moderate inflation, said Sanjiv Bajaj, chairman and managing director of Bajaj Finserv and newly elected president of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). The industry body expects the economy to grow in the range of 7.4-8.2% in FY23, “with the outlook critically hinging on the trajectory of global crude oil prices,"" said a statement from CII quoting Bajaj. “An immediate measure to moderate inflation could be to moderate taxes on fuel products, which constitute a large share of the retail pump prices of petrol and diesel... CII would encourage Centre and state governments to collaborate in reducing these duties,"" the statement said quoting Bajaj. The appeal to cut taxes on petrol and diesel comes in the context of retail inflation measured by consumer price index (CPI) surging to an eight-year-high in April at 7.79%, led by a surge in food and fuel prices. It raised expectations that the central bank may favour more aggressive rate hikes in June to cool prices. According to Bajaj, global headwinds and inflation will have to be countered with policy reforms to unlock the growth potential of the economy. “Tailwinds that are supportive of growth in the short-term include government capital expenditure, private sector investment which is showing an uptick aided by strong demand in some sectors and the production linked incentive push in the others, good agriculture season on the back of the expectations of a good monsoon and positive export momentum,"" Bajaj said. He said the Indian economy has the potential to reach $40 trillion by 2047, with milestones at $5 trillion by 2026-27 and $9 trillion by 2030-31. The finance ministry said last week that the April update of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) of the IMF implied that the cost of restraining inflation will be slowing global growth. The multilateral agency projected growth of global output to decline from 6.1% in 2021 to 3.6% in 2022 as well as 2023. If global inflation does not sufficiently decline despite aggressive monetary tightening sharply slowing growth, it points at the persistence of supply-demand imbalances that only coordinated action by world leaders can resolve, the ministry said last week in its monthly economic review. IMF expects India’s economy to grow at 8.2% in 2022-23. The government’s optimism stems from scaled-up capital spending, tax buoyancy and some other high frequency indicators like electricity consumption. Bajaj suggested that both central and state governments should scale up their expenditure on public health and education to make these services accessible to all. “This will drive inclusive and equitable growth, improve workforce productivity, and make the economy more resilient. This will also drive consumption demand, the biggest engine of the economy, by reducing out of pocket expenses on these two essentials leaving people with more to spend,"" the statement said quoting Bajaj. He also suggested that providing universal coverage in health and education will create good quality jobs at scale. He said the country should extend the production linked incentive scheme to more sectors, especially those which are labour intensive such as leather, footwear and toys, and sectors where imports are high. He said employment linked incentive schemes should be launched for select services sectors with high growth potential."

An analysis by domestic brokerage house Motilal Oswal Financial Services showed that in FY22, Nifty50 recorded an impressive 19% year-on-year gain and ended the financial year with the second-best returns in seven years. Following the escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) ditched Indian equities as crude oil-led macro and micro impact made Indian stocks less attractive. Nonetheless, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) came to the rescue. DII flows into equities in FY22 were the highest ever at $26.8 billion compared to outflows of $18.4b in FY21, while FIIs witnessed equity outflows of $17.1 billion after five consecutive years of inflows, as per the Motilal Oswal report. Sectoral indices also posted decent performance during this period. ""Top gainers in the sectoral space were Utilities (+63%), Metals (+62%), Media (+54%), Oil & Gas (+42%), Telecom (+42%), and Technology (+40%). While Private Banks, Consumer, Autos, and Healthcare underperformed,"" added the report. Also, market breadth was positive in FY22, with 37 Nifty constituents closing higher. Stock-wise, Bajaj Finserv Ltd, Hindalco Industries Ltd, Titan Industries Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd, and ONGC were the top performers. On the other hand, HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd, Hero Motocorp Ltd, Shree Cement Ltd, BPCL and Hindustan Unilever Ltd were the top laggards. Broader markets also put up an impressive performance. The Nifty Midcap 100, up more than 25% y-o-y, and the Nifty Smallcap 100, up more than 29% y-o-y, outperformed the benchmark in FY22, showed the analysis. Meanwhile, going into FY23, corporate earnings would be key among the many factors that will decide the market mood. The March quarter numbers for FY22, will throw light on the impact of the Russia-Ukraine crisis on the margins of companies relying on crude-based raw materials.  IT giant Tata Consultancy Services Ltd will kick-off the Q4FY22 earnings season, with results scheduled for 11 April."

Updated: 21 Dec 2021,Five reasons to start investing in a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit,https://www.livemint.com/brand-post/five-reasons-to-start-investing-in-a-bajaj-finance-fixed-deposit-11640062790709.html,"A suitable investment helps grow your wealth and provides you with financial flexibility. Investments in the current economy are essential to help you cope with increasing personal and financial needs. Of all the investment options you can rely on, a fixed deposit stands out for its safe and secured nature. 95% of Indians prefer this traditional investment option over others. And for those who want to gain more without compromising the safety of their deposit, NBFCs such as Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit offer high FD interest rates. Whether your goal is to fund a down payment for your new home or finance your next vacation, a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit with its high FD rates helps you fulfil it. This financial instrument offers you better returns than many other investments without the risk of losing your capital to market fluctuations. An FD helps you plan your finances confidently and ensure your dreams and obligations never take a back seat. Read on to know how the Bajaj Finance FD is beneficial for you due its high ROI. Get lucrative returns on your investment Getting high returns on your investment alongside safety is now possible with the Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit. It offers you attractive returns with FD interest rates of up to 7.05%. Citizens below 60 years get a cumulative interest benefit of up to 6.80%. Senior citizens enjoy up to 0.25% p.a. additional interest rate benefit irrespective of whether they invest offline or online. The interest rate offered to you depends on the investment tenor you choose. Here is an illustration of the returns you would earn if you invested Rs. 3 lakh for 36 months with the payout at maturity.  *Returns calculated using the FD calculator. Invest affordably and flexibly The Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit allows you to invest starting at just Rs. 25,000. This way, you can start small and build your wealth with the high FD rates. You can plan your financial goals well and get a flexible investment tenor of 12 to 60 months. You can also ladder FDs depending on your goals by starting several FDs that mature at different intervals to meet your needs. Remember, keeping your money invested for an extended period fetches you higher FD interest rates. While you also earn more when you choose payouts at maturity, you can also select regular payouts every month or quarter. This system allows you to make a stable income to meet your financial responsibilities, such as EMI payments or school fees. Plan your investment with an accurate FD calculator A healthy financial portfolio requires sound financial planning. Tools like the fixed deposit calculator offered by Bajaj Finance help you plan better as you can forecast your returns effectively. The calculator applies the interest rate applicable to you and instantly calculates the interest payout and maturity amount. Build a corpus with the Systematic Deposit Plan While a fixed deposit is traditionally an investment that requires a lump sum, Bajaj Finance offers the option of a Systematic Deposit Plan (SDP) where you can start your investment at just Rs. 5,000 every month. Each deposit serves as a separate FD, and you earn as per the prevailing FD interest rates. SDP is more like a SIP with monthly investments but no risk of market volatility. This plan is suitable for investors looking to methodically invest small amounts and gradually build a considerable corpus of funds. Grow your wealth with a secured investment Knowing where to invest makes all the difference when it comes to safety. The Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit has been awarded the highest safety rating of FAAA/Stable and MAAA (stable) from CRISIL and ICRA. These ratings represent no risk, timely payments, and a default-free experience. With such surety, you can keep your savings invested for a more extended period and gain higher returns on your investment. Therefore, individuals can easily invest in a Bajaj Finance online FD to benefit from high FD interest rates and a suite of other features. Disclaimer: This content is distributed by Bajaj Finserv.

Updated: 15 Dec 2021,How to apply for your home loan online: The process,https://www.livemint.com/brand-post/how-to-apply-for-your-home-loan-online-the-process-11639559517553.html,"Homebuying is a serious financial commitment as it is an exciting milestone in one’s life. Most of us require external financing to support our dream to own property, and home loans today make it that much easier. With leading lenders now offering more relaxed and customer-centric borrowing terms and rates, availing of a home loan not only aids your home buying journey but also helps accelerate your tax savings. Given the impact of this financial decision, home loan aspirants must be cautious about which lender they choose to borrow from and the home loan application process itself. While the application process is not very complex, one must ensure they’re following it to the T and meeting the prescribed eligibility criteria, which is unique to each lending institution. However, thanks to the digital transformation of the mortgages industry – any information you need about your home loan is available online, allowing you to research and carry out your due diligence before you apply. And not just that, industry leaders such as Bajaj Housing Finance Limited even offer online applications — taking the entire home loan borrowing journey online, with very little physical interaction at a time where social distancing is the need of the hour. Individuals applying through the lender’s online home loan application form can also get a digital sanction letter. The whole form takes about 10 minutes to complete and requests only basic details. In this article, we tell you everything you need to know before making your home loan application online. Home Loan Eligibility Criteria The first thing any home loan aspirant must look at closely is their home loan eligibility. Every lender has a set list of asks that they expect applicants to meet, following which they can approve of their loan request. The parameters include one’s age, credit score, repayment capacity, income, and obligation, among others. Applicants are advised to check their eligibility beforehand to see how they measure up against the lender’s criteria and only then apply. This can help one find the home loan best suited to their repayment capacity and enhance their chances of getting approved. Applicants must note that their credit rating is also hampered if their home loan application stands rejected — so one must be certain of their chances of being approved before they apply. Home Loan Interest Rate Another important point to factor in while you’re looking for the right home loan is the applicable interest rate. The interest rate is fundamental in determining how expensive your home loan can be and how you can plan your finances. Lenders offer two types of interest rates on home loans to eligible applicants, namely fixed and floating. 1. Fixed interest rate: If one opts for a fixed interest rate, they insulate their home loan EMIs from market fluctuations. As the name suggests, the interest rate remains the same throughout the tenor or till a reset date. However, fixed interest rate is typically a little higher than floating interest rate. 2. Floating interest rate: As the name suggests, this interest rate is linked to an internal/external benchmark and is subject to change depending on the market. This rate is not only lower than the fixed interest rate, it also passes the borrower the benefit of favourable market conditions – translating to lower interest rates and smaller EMIs. Reputed lenders such as Bajaj Housing Finance offer salaried and professional applicants floating interest rate home loans from 6.70%* p.a., basis eligibility. Calculate Home Loan EMI Every home loan aspirant must take stock of their repayment capacity and calculate their possible home loan EMI to see if it is an amount they can comfortably repay over a long period of time. Having a tentative repayment schedule in place is important as it helps you plan your long-term financial goals, as well as track your EMI outflow – reducing any chances of defaulting. The first step of planning your repayment is to determine the loan amount you need from your lender. An applicant can typically get a sizable value if they have a strong financial, income, and credit profile and can meet the eligibility criteria as mandated. After you’ve decided on your loan sum, you will need to fix the loan tenor over which you will repay the loan. There are several considerations to take into account, such as your age at the time of borrowing, your EMI to income ratio, and your financial profile. Using a Home Loan Calculator makes it easier for you to forecast your possible home loan EMIs. The Bajaj Housing Finance Home Loan Calculator is a free and easy-to-use digital tool that allows borrowers to adjust their loan amount, loan tenor, and interest rate as they please, to get a realistic idea of what their EMIs could shape up to be – which in turn shows them if they can afford the home loan they desire. How to Apply for Your Home Loan Online The online home loan application journey hosted by market leaders, such as Bajaj Housing Finance Limited, is easy to follow and efficient – allowing you to save both time and effort while you make your home loan application. Here is how to apply for your home loan online: - Visit the website of your loan provider and go to their online home loan application - Select the loan product that you are interested in - Provide basic details as asked for on the form – your name, income details, ID proof, address proof, and co-applicant details (if needed) - Adjust the loan amount, tenor, and preferred interest rate as per your needs - Check for pre-approved offers and special benefits tailored for you - Upload other necessary paperwork and documents before finally completing the application Many lenders also provide on call assistance, with a customer care consultant who can assist you through the process. Toll-free phone numbers are also available to make the process easier for the borrower. Conclusion In the post-pandemic world, taking the home loan application online has been extremely beneficial for borrowers and lenders alike. This move towards digitalization also gives the borrower full control over their application and makes their borrowing experience hassle-free. If you’re in the market for a home loan, consider opting for the Bajaj Housing Finance Limited Online Home Loan – designed for maximum affordability and convenience. One can complete the form in just 3 steps and get a Digital Sanction Letter in as little as 10 minutes. Disclaimer: This content is distributed by Bajaj Finserv.

""Subdued listing and continuation of weak trading of Paytm, India’s largest new generation fintech, is a big sentimental setback to the domestic market, which was thriving on the strong primary market. It will impact the inflow of money from the retail segment, which has been a key player during the year. FIIs are also a seller due to fear of overvaluation of India compared to peers. ""Weak inflow from FIIs will possibly get higher due to the withdrawal of three agriculture farm acts which brings a stoppage to governments reformist agendas in context to coming state elections next year. It was a key factor for India to trade at a premium to EMs during the year,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said.

Equity markets had a historical journey in Samvat 2077, touching new life- time highs with the Nifty surpassing the 18000-mark while the Sensex crossing 60,000 for the first time. Analysts said the government’s fiscal stimulus and a soft monetary policy stance of global central bankers were key drivers of equities in Samvat 2077. Post the second wave of covid, signs of improvement in high-frequency key economic indicators such as GST collection, railway freight, power consumption, import-export data, e-way bills among others amid vaccination boosted investor sentiment. Overall, most sectors delivered positive returns, with metals ( up 128%), realty (up 113%) and PSU banks (up 93%) as top gainers. Sectors such as pharma (up 23%), FMCG (up 29%) and private banks (up 30%) were underperformers as defensives took a breather. In comparison, mid- and small-caps did exceedingly well in Samvat 2077. The BSE MidCap index surged 61% while the BSE SmallCap jumped 79% during the year.  "
Updated: 29 Oct 2021,Get instant access to funds with a pre-approved personal loan offer,https://www.livemint.com/brand-post/get-instant-access-to-funds-with-a-pre-approved-personal-loan-offer-11635507958899.html,"If you're in urgent need of funds, there are few options as convenient as a pre-approved personal loan. A pre-approved loan is a personalised offering tailored to match your unique profile. A key benefit of such an instrument is that it guarantees quick disbursal. The last 18 months have shown us how uncertain times can be, and there's only so much you can do to be prepared. This is especially true when dealing with emergencies, but you can manage them easily with such offers. You don't need to be worried about lengthy procedures or about the fear of depleting your financial reserves when in a crisis. A pre-approved personal loan eliminates the need to dip into your savings and is a reliable option for instant financing. To know more about a pre-approved personal loan offer and its benefits, read on. Difference between a personal loan and a pre-approved personal loan A pre-approved loan is an unsecured and collateral-free loan that you can access based on your creditworthiness, similar to a personal loan. However, when you want a personal loan, you have to approach a lender for the loan, which is not the case for a pre-approved loan. Here, lenders provide you with personalised loan offers that you can choose to accept. This puts you in a position to avail of special deals. You get pre-approved loan offers if you have a good credit history and have the financials to back it. Since your creditworthiness is already evaluated before the offer is made, loan processing is hassle-free and quick. Therefore, with a pre-approved personal loan offer, you get access to funds in no time at all. Advantages of a pre-approved personal loan A personal loan is replete with benefits such as unrestricted use, a quick application process, and prompt approval. The same perks apply to a pre-approved personal loan as well, in addition to a couple more. Read on to know all about the benefits of a pre-approved personal loan. Speedy and time-efficient procedures A lender offers you a pre-approved loan after evaluating your credit profile. Therefore, all the underwriting processes that occur after you apply for a personal loan have already been completed. Hence, all you need to do is check your pre-approved loan offer, accept its terms and conditions, and await the disbursal of your loan amount. This saves you the hassle of choosing a lender, applying for a personal loan, and undergoing the approval procedures. A personal loan is a collateral-free loan, ensuring a short application process. In the case of a pre-approved personal loan, this timeline is even faster, making it significantly quicker. Favourable and competitive personal loan interest rate Since you get selected by the lender based on your borrowing history and creditworthiness, they offer you a competitive interest rate. These personal loan interest rates are generally not applicable to regular applicants. Moreover, since the loan is offered to you, lenders are open to negotiating interest rates and other terms of the loans. Minimal documentation and speedy disbursal of loan sanction To get a personal loan, you need to apply for it either offline or online. This entails filling the application form, submitting the necessary documents, and getting approval. However, since it is a pre-approved personal loan offer, you don't have to go through this process and may need to submit basic KYC documents. Some lenders even offer a completely paperless provision, which means you only need to verify a few pre-filled details. Once you've done this, it is just a matter of accepting the offering and authorising disbursal. Within hours, you'll have the amount credited to your account. Find your pre-approved offer without divulging too much personal information You can now get a personal loan online from the comfort of your home. All you need to do is log on to the lender's website or personal loan app, fill in a detailed application form and attach necessary documents. (However, before you apply for a loan, you need to conduct your research to get the best loan deal and check the personal loan eligibility criteria of the lender.) Is this line needed? But with a pre-approved personal loan offer, you do not have to do any of this. You can check your pre-approved loan offer by just filling in your name, contact number, and city. For instance, you can get a Bajaj Finserv pre-approved loan in just a few seconds. Check your pre-approved offer by sharing basic information. With a Bajaj Finserv pre-approved personal loan, you can get a sanction of up to Rs. 25 lakh and have the entire amount disbursed in no time. What's more, you can opt to repay over a flexible repayment tenor of up to 60 months so that EMIs are always within budget. Calculate personal loan EMI using the EMI calculator to find the best terms before you avail of the offer. Considering the benefits applicable on this personal loan, apply online for a smooth borrowing experience.   Disclaimer: This content is distributed by Bajaj Finserv.

Updated: 28 Oct 2021,"Markets may continue to consolidate; Future group, SpiceJet, SBI Card in focus",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/markets-may-continue-to-consolidate-future-group-spicejet-sbi-card-in-focus-11635389514758.html,"MUMBAI: Indian stock markets will likely consolidate further on Thursday while SGX Nifty trends indicate a tepid opening of domestic benchmark indices. On Wednesday, the BSE Sensex ended at 61,143.33, down 206.93 points or 0.34% and the Nifty was at 18,210.95, down 57.45 points or 0.31%. Global stocks eased from record peaks as a stark reminder of supply chain snags in corporate earnings reports stalled their rally, while investors also looked to whether central banks may consider tightening monetary policy earlier than thought. MSCI's gauge of world stocks, ACWI, dipped 0.05% in early Thursday trade, with Japan's Nikkei leading the loss with fall of 1.1%. Mainland Chinese shares slipped 0.2% while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked down 0.1%. Overnight, on the Wall Street, the S&P 500 lost 0.51% from all-time high hit on Tuesday though the Nasdaq ended little changed, thanks to strong earnings from Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet. Back home, the Amazon-Future battle over the Reliance Retail deal has yet again reached the Delhi high court, with the Future Group seeking a stay on an interim order passed by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) on 21 October. According to a regulatory filing on Wednesday, Future Group promoters and Future Coupons Pvt. Ltd have also urged the high court to set aside the SIAC order. SpiceJet Merchandise Pvt. Ltd, a subsidiary of no-frills carrier SpiceJet Ltd, on Wednesday agreed to make pending payments to public sector lender Canara Bank regarding a two-year-old acquisition, according to a Mint report. Among key companies, Bajaj Finserv, Adani Green Energy, Adani Total Gas, NPTC, SBI Cards & Payment Services, DLF, Interglobe Aviation, Marico, Tata Power, Gujarat Gas and AU Small Finance Bank will release their September quarter earnings today. With global supply disruption fuelling worries about inflation, investors are keeping close eye on whether the world’s central banks will look to reduce their generous pandemic stimulus measures more quickly. The US Federal Reserve is almost unanimously expected to announce tapering of its bond purchase at its policy meeting next week. The two-year U.S. Treasuries yield rose to as high as 0.528% and last stood at 0.501%. At the start of October, it was around 0.26%. In contrast, longer-dated yields fell in part as a tighter monetary policy is likely to tame inflation down the road. The 10-year U.S. notes yields dropped to 1.545%, compared with a five-month peak of 1.705% touched a week ago. Also helping to drive global bond yields lower was a plunge in UK Gilts yields after Britain’s government cut its borrowing forecasts more than expected. The 10-year Gilt yield fell 12.8 basis points on Wednesday, its biggest decline since March 2020, to 0.982%. Other major currencies were on hold ahead of policy announcements from the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank later in the day, though no major changes are expected. The yen stood at 113.73 per dollar, off its four-year low of 114.695 touched last week while the euro changed hands at $1.1600. Oil prices fell after U.S. crude stockpiles rose more than expected, even as fuel inventories dropped and tanks at the nation’s largest storage hub emptied further. The bigger-than-expected rise in U.S. crude stocks gave some investors an impetus to unload long positions after strong gains in recent weeks brought both the Brent and US crude benchmarks to multi-year highs. Brent fell 1.8% to $83.07 per barrel, off Monday’s seven-year high of $86.70 while U.S. crude fetched $81.25 per barrel, down 1.7% and off Monday’s peak of $85.41, a seven-year high.
