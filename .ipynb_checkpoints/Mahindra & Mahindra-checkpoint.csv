Elon Musk's pulling out of the Twitter buyout deal set the stage for a court battle as the social media giant said it will sue the Tesla CEO. Just as Elon Musk backed out of the deal, triggering an avalanche of reactions, Industrialist Anand Mahindra also joined in, poking fun at the development. Taking to Twitter, Anand Mahindra wrote: ""If Elon [Musk] was traveling on an Indian train, the conductor would label him a ""TT"" Ticketless Traveler,"" he said, adding, ""But TT could now also become a term for any headline grabbing bid that implodes: A Twitter Tease.""   Reacting to Anand Mahindra's tweet, a Twitter user asked the Mahindra Group Chairperson: ""why don't u consider buying twitter? We are too much dependent on these social media controlled by west. They can shutt off anyday like they did to Russia (ie SWIFT, apple). We are self reliant in automobiles & payments thanks to #mahindra #tata #bajaja #tvs #UPI."" Another asked, ""Sir why don't you open the same platform pan India."" A Twitter user said, ""Thankfully, ticketless travelers don't change the direction of the train as per their whims."" Elon Musk announced Friday that he will abandon his tumultuous $44 billion offer to buy Twitter after the company failed to provide enough information about the number of fake accounts. Twitter immediately fired back, saying it would sue the Tesla CEO to uphold the deal."
Updated: 09 Jul 2022,3 bluechip stocks to BUY as suggested by Sharekhan,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/3-bluechip-stocks-to-buy-as-suggested-by-sharekhan-11657363784346.html,"The shares of Titan Company, TCS, and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. have been given a buy call rating by the brokerage company Sharekhan. Since the brokerage has set a target price of Rs. 2,900 for Titan, Rs. 3,650 for Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., and Rs. 1,390 for Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M), all of these blue-chip stocks offer tremendous potential upside from the current market price.  Sharekhan has said in a note that “Titan Company Limited’s (Titan) pre-quarter update outlined a good start to FY2023 with strong growth of 3.0x in revenue and robust growth across key businesses and subsidiaries. We expect revenue to be at Rs. 9,180 crore at a consolidated level (and ~Rs. 8,650 crore at a standalone level). Revenue of the jewellery business (excluding bullion sales in the base quarter) grew by 3x y-o-y i.e. to ~Rs. 7,570 crore. Despite near-term headwinds of high inflation, the company is confident of maintaining good growth momentum in the quarters ahead because of market share gains, network expansion, and shift to trusted brands. The company aims to achieve consistent double-digit revenue growth over the next five years by strengthening core businesses such as watches, jewellery, and eyecare through efficient capital allocation plans. Further, profitability is expected to consistently improve with consistent growth in the jewellery business and scale-up in new ventures."" “Titan is aiming to generate revenue CAGR of over 20% revenue during FY2022-FY2027 on back of its ambitious growth plan in the medium term. This along with consistent margin improvement will help cash flows to improve strongly in the coming years. FY2023 will be a strong year for the company due to low base in core businesses. The stock has corrected by ~15% in the past three months, in-line with substantial correction in the broader indices. The company’s strong growth outlook, industry tailwinds in the medium term, and strong balance sheet make it a best play in the retail space. Hence, we maintain our Buy recommendation on the stock with an unchanged price target (PT) of Rs. 2,900,"" said the brokerage.  The brokerage has said that “TCS reported steady revenue growth with strong client addition across large revenue buckets and healthy deal wins, while margins lagged our expectations owing to wage revisions, supply-side challenges and rising discretionary expenses. Constant currency (CC) revenue grew by 3.5%/15.5% y-o-y in Q1FY2023, in-line with our estimates, led by continued strong growth in North America and broad-based growth across verticals with strong growth in Retail & CPG. Deal TCVs remained healthy at $8.2 billion (including two large deals worth of $400 million+) during Q1FY23, up by 1.2% y-o-y, but it was down 27% q-o-q. The book-to-bill ratio stood at 1.21x, in-line with its long term average book-to-bill ratio. EBIT margin declined by 190 bps q-o-q to 23.1%, lagged our estimates. TCS continues see strong traction across cloud adoption, operating model transformation, vendor consolidation, growth and transformation (G&T) programs. We believe the company is well positioned to gain most from market opportunities even in case deteriorating macro concerns given its strong marquee clientele, strong capabilities and solid execution capability."" “We believe that TCS has a robust business model which would leverage both G&T opportunities and operation transformation program given its strong capabilities and end-to-end service capabilities. We expect the company’s US Dollar revenues and earnings to clock a 10%/11% CAGR over FY2022-24E. At CMP, the stock trades at valuation of 28x/25x its FY2023E/FY2024E earnings, in-line with 5-year average 1-year forward PE multiple. We continue to prefer TCS considering its better supply-management capability, best-in-class execution, deep expertise, full-service model and excellent payout ratios. Further, the stock price correction of around 14% on a YTD basis offers good entry opportunity for long-term investment. Hence, we maintain a Buy on TCS with a revised PT of Rs. 3,650,"" said Sharekhan.  As per the brokerage “Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) and British International Investment (BII) have executed a binding agreement to invest Rs. 1,925 crore ($250 million) each into M&M’s wholly owned subsidiary that will be incorporated soon to spin its passenger electric vehicle (EVCo) business. BII is a UK government development finance institution and a leading impact investor with focus on climate change and ESG. BII is expected to acquire 2.75-4.76% stake in M&M’s subsidiary EVCo at a valuation of US$ 5.1-8.8 billion (Rs. 40,441-70,070 crore). Promoters, along with investors to infuse ~Rs. 10,000 crore in the new EVCo between FY22 to FY27, to launch five electric vehicle models. The company targets its Electric SUV penetration to be 20-30% of its overall SUV portfolio by FY2027 and expects EV volumes at ~200,000 per annum in best case scenario. The EVCo will be asset light and leverage M&M’s ecosystem of suppliers, dealers and financers."" “M&M will provide manufacturing support, design, product development, technology and sourcing services on arm’s length. We firmly believe that M&M is on track with its growth roadmap. Besides its aggressive plans for the farm equipment and ICE passenger car segments, the company is taking leap towards making strong product portfolio for passenger electric vehicles. In the ICE segment, M&M has become No.1 in SUV revenue market share in H2FY22 with 16.8% market share. We expect Scorpio-N to further consolidate its share in the SUV market. Successful new launches will continue to help M&M to increase its market share in the SUV and LCV segments. M&M has guided for strengthening of the SUV segment through product launches of 13 new products by FY2027E, including EV launches. Further, the management continues to focus on the farm equipment segment and maintained its guidance to achieve a 10x revenue growth by FY2027E. M&M has maintained its FY25E guidance to deliver an 18% RoE and 15-20% EPS growth,"" said Sharekhan. The brokerage has further claimed that “We expect M&M to benefit from its leadership status in the tractor segment, strengthening position in the LCV segment and regaining its market share in the highly competitive SUV segment. M&M is on track with its growth roadmap. The company plans its farm business to grow 10x by FY2027E, while strengthen its SUV segment by adding 13 new products by FY2027E, including EV launches. The investment commitment of US$ 250 million by impact investor, British International Investment (BII), in M&M’s passenger electric vehicle arm is a positive development and would help M&M in attracting additional sources of private capital into EVCo venture. The EVCo business add Rs. 132 per share to our SOTP based PT. Further, M&M continues to benefit from the turnaround of loss-making subsidiaries, scaling up of digital platforms and strong performance of its listed entities, which would improve the company’s FCF going forward. We expect standalone earnings to post a 22.5% CAGR during FY22-FY24E, driven by a 16.7% revenue CAGR and 190 bps rise in EBITDA margins. We reiterate Buy rating on the stock with a revised PT of Rs. 1,390. The stock trades at a P/E multiple of 17.6x and EV/EBITDA multiple of 11x its FY24E estimates.""

Updated: 09 Jul 2022,Mahindra sees E-SUVs making up 30% of its sales by fiscal 2027,https://www.livemint.com/auto-news/mahindra-sees-e-suvs-making-up-30-of-its-sales-by-fiscal-2027-11657303303840.html,"MUMBAI : Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd has set an ambitious aim of achieving 20-30% of its total sales from electric sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) in the next five years, with the automaker set to start selling the first of five electric SUVs early next year. To propel its electric initiatives, M&M on Thursday announced an investment of ₹1,925 crore ($250 million) from British International Investment (BII) into its wholly owned EV unit that will be newly incorporated. The UK government’s development finance institution will invest in compulsory convertible instruments for a 2.75-4.76% stake in the new company at a valuation of up to ₹70,070 crore. M&M will also invest an equal sum in the entity focusing on producing four-wheeled passenger electric vehicles. Overall, the Mumbai-based automaker has outlined a total capital infusion of ₹8,000 crore in the EV business in FY24-27, and the investments from BII and the company will fund this initiative. M&M’s ambitious plans come as the automaker seeks to get a bigger foothold in the fast-growing Indian EV market. Considered a pioneer of the Indian EV industry, M&M took a majority stake in Bengaluru-based The Reva Electric Car Co. Ltd in 2010 and renamed it Mahindra Reva Electric Vehicles Pvt. Ltd, which made the e2o electric small car. In 2016, M&M further renamed the company Mahindra Electric Mobility. Meanwhile, the Indian EV industry is undergoing rapid changes buoyed by government incentives and the launch of new models. Tata Motors Ltd is now the top EV maker with high-selling models like the Nexon compact SUV and Tigor compact sedan. Others, such as MG Motor India and Hyundai Motor India, also sell EVs in addition to luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz and Audi. “Electric SUV segment is at an inflection point. Several pieces of data give confidence that electric SUV penetration will go up significantly over the next three years. Market research indicated that 85% of Indians desire to move to electric, and that percentage is among the highest in the world. We are projecting that, by FY27, we will get a penetration of somewhere between 20-30% of our SUV portfolio as electric,"" Rajesh Jejurikar, executive director, auto and farm sectors at M&M, told a press conference on Friday. M&M currently produces a range of electric three-wheelers and small commercial vehicles. However, these vehicles won’t be part of the new EV company."

This comes on the back of the company’s announcement of executing an agreement with British International Investment (BII), UK’s development finance institution, to invest up to Rs1,925 crore or $250 million each into a wholly owned subsidiary of M&M, EVCo, which will be newly incorporated. Post the capital infusion in EVCo, BII would hold a 2.75%-4.76% stake in the subsidiary. Based on BII’s investment of $250 million, EVCo’s valuation is around $5.9-9.1 billion, according to analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. “It implies a gross value for M&M shareholders at Rs360-569/share,"" said Motilal Oswal analysts in a report on 7 July. Note that this transaction does not include electric vehicle segments such as three-wheelers and light commercial vehicles. EVCo would focus on electric passenger vehicles in the four-wheeler (4W) segment. The assets of M&M’s 4W passenger vehicle electric business would be transferred to EVCo. Over FY24-27, the total capital infusion is expected to be around Rs8000 crore or $1 billion. The utilization of the funds will be directed towards creating an electric SUV portfolio with advanced technologies, said the company. As such, M&M expects the proportion of electric sports utility vehicles (SUV) in its SUV portfolio to reach 20%-30% by 2027. It is likely to reveal the electric XUV 400 in September. “Net value accretion to M&M shareholders will depend on its ability to leverage the electrification trend and expand its market share in the SUV segment. Currently, we are not valuing the EV business separately as it doesn’t have any material presence in the electric PV segment,"" added the Motilal Oswal report."

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) will kick off the earnings season on Friday. However, the peak revenue growth of these companies is likely to be behind them and the momentum is expected to start softening from H2 FY23 due to absence of large deal wins and clients postponing their technology spends.

Growth in Tech Mahindra, Wipro and HCL Technologies is expected to be soft due to seasonal weakness and moderation in demand,"" ICICI Securities said in a pre-earnings note. Margins are likely to be under pressure due to wage hikes, higher backfilling costs, increase in travel/visa/other discretionary costs with the easing of travel restrictions, and back-to-office trends, said Emkay Research. “Due to cross-currency headwinds, benefits from rupee depreciation will be marginal in Q1."" The brokerage firm expects Infosys to retain its annual revenue growth guidance of 13-15% in constant currency and EBIT margin guidance of 21-23% for FY23.

This advice by investment guru Warren Buffet has remained the guiding principle for Nilesh Shah where it concerns his investments. “I invest as if I am not going to touch it (the investments) for the next decade or so,"" says Shah, the managing director at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company Ltd. As with many CEOs and senior executives of companies, a large part of Shah’s wealth, too, is tied to his employer. Most of his personal wealth (60%) is in equity—either in employee stock options (ESOPs) or shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank that he acquired long ago. (He owns some shares in the physical format as well so that he doesn’t get tempted to sell them.) Another 15% of his assets is held in equity mutual funds, mostly in the large cap and large-and-mid cap category segments. Shah does not invest in passive funds, except where it is required as per market regulator Sebi’s rules. Under these regulations, as the CEO of Kotak Mahindra AMC, Shah has to invest in all the schemes of the fund house. But these rules came into effect only in October 2021, and hence such mutual fund (MF) units are a very small part of Shah’s portfolio. Interestingly, Shah relies on a distributor to transact in MFs rather than opting for direct plans.       "

The tech savvy Anand Mahindra was quick to take notice and he reposted Goenka's video with an equally important message. The video shared by Harsh Goenka showed a conversation between the pencil and an eraser and drew comparison between parents as erasers and the children as pencils. The video showed, just like erasers, parents erase themselves slowly while correcting the mistakes of the children. The video ended with a strong reminder which said, ""take care of your parents, treat them with kindness and most importantly, love them."" To this, Anand Mahindra added an important message which is often missed out on just like the message in the video. Mahindra tweeted, “a very poignant message that naturally resonates with us elderly parents. But it also occurred to me, Harsh, that often, many children in the world have to spend much of their lives erasing the mistakes & missteps of their parents!"" Netizens took notice of the video and the message shared by Anand Mahindra as it resonated with them. Many felt they could relate to the message shared by Mahindra. Twitter user named Vishal Jindal said, “Yes Anand sir, so very well said & summed up. My respect for you grows each day."" “Anand jee, you are correct. Parents don’t erase mistakes of their children. They help their children recover from their mistakes. Many parents spoil their children. I hope I have spoiled my children little less,"" another Twitter user named Sanjai Misra shared.  While user named Bala had something more to share, she wrote, “very nice and candid comment by Mr Mahindra! Some children are indeed unfortunate that way! All the same, it is sad that children now have to be taught/reminded about their responsibility to take care and treat well, their parents, with such stories!""  "
Updated: 02 Jul 2022,Carmakers step on the gas as semiconductor shortage eases,https://www.livemint.com/auto-news/carmakers-step-on-the-gas-as-semiconductor-shortage-eases-11656699036106.html,"Easing supplies of semiconductor chips is aiding a gradual recovery in production for Indian automakers as they line up new launches to capture a sharp rebound in automobile sales with the abatement of the pandemic and an increased preference for personal mobility. Leading carmakers such as Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) have said that semiconductor supplies have begun to improve from June and that production is expected to rise from this month. Senior industry executives said Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest carmaker, plans to produce more than 11,000 units of its newly launched compact SUV Brezza this month, whereas M&M is looking to add 6,000 units of its new Scorpio-N SUV as it gears towards a festive season delivery. Maruti Suzuki is also gearing up to start production of a new midsize SUV at Toyota’s Karnataka plant starting August, which is expected to go on sale sometime in the festive season. “The semiconductor situation has become better. We were at 40% of our plan in September last year, which was when we were the worst hit. We increased it to 60% in October, 85% in November, 90% in December, 92% in Jan and Feb, 93-94% in March and April, and 95% in May and June. So, in that sense, there is a consistent increase. We are not certain what time we will reach 100%, but we expect to get there soon,"" said Shashank Srivastava, executive director of Maruti Suzuki. Automakers’ reliance on electronic chips has significantly increased as vehicles become more feature-rich. Carmakers across the board see greater preferences for top-end variants of cars, which use comparatively more semiconductor chips than the lower-end versions. Carmakers are also revisiting lower-end models to eliminate the use of chips that are not critical to a vehicle. The shortage of chips and the lack of supply chain readiness have also pushed back launch timelines for some automakers, as was the case for M&M’s Scorpio-N, which was launched after a delay of more than a quarter. Despite easing chip supplies, automakers are running waiting periods as long as two years for some models as demand continues to outstrip supply. “The chip situation has improved compared to what it was for us from August to December last year. We, in particular, were very dependent on one supplier who had a very high dependence on Malaysia, and Malaysia had a washout for almost two months due to covid-19. But since then, the semiconductor situation is much better,"" said Rajesh Jejurikar, executive director, auto and farm sector at M&M. Recent supply-chain disruptions emanating from the fresh surge of covid-19 in China are also easing. “Demand for passenger vehicles continued to stay strong in Q1 FY23 even as the supply side remained moderately impacted due to the lockdown in China. As a result, we expect the supply side, including that of critical electronic components, to progressively improve,"" said Shailesh Chandra, managing director, Tata Motors passenger vehicles and Tata passenger electric mobility, in a press release announcing its June quarter sales on Friday. “The most difficult part of the China lockdown is behind us. Shanghai is now mostly open, with panic in some pockets. Beijing is affected, but there isn’t a large industrial base there, so it doesn’t affect supply chains the way Shanghai did,"" Jejurikar added."

In a 104-page adjudicating order, the regulator's adjudicating officer found faults in the conduct of the AMC and its officials on two grounds - extending the maturity of papers belonging to Essel group, and lack of due diligence while investing in the Essel group companies. ""It is observed that Kotak AMC entered into an agreement with promoters and other promoter entities of Essel Group to extend the maturity of securities of various Essel Group entities to September 30, 2019. Consequently, investors of all the six schemes were not paid full amount on maturity based on the Net Asset Value (NAV),"" Sebi said in its order. ""No reference was made to the financials and operations of the issuers in the investment plan. Investment decision was only based on analysis of collateral (Zee),"" it added. Sebi had passed its first order in the matter in August last year. The fund house plans to file an appeal against the roder. ""In the same matter, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company Limited’s appeal is pending with Securities Appellate Tribunal,"" said a spokesperson for the AMC. Others penalised include, Kotak Mahindra Trustee Company, and Kotak AMC's fund managers Lakshmi Iyer, Deepak Agarwal, and Abhishek Bisen besides compliance officers Jolly Bhatt and Gaurang Shah, who were part of the investment committee that approved the investment decisions related to these fixed maturity plans. According to the regulator, the trustees and AMC should have ensured extreme care, caution, robust due diligence since such debt papers are inherently riskier assets since the secondary markets for these securities are generally illiquid in nature and also since detailed information as well as research reports regarding these entities are not easily available in the market."

Others penalised by Sebi are Kotak AMC's fund managers -- Lakshmi Iyer, Deepak Agarwal, Abhishek Bisen -- Compliance Officer Jolly Bhatt and Gaurang Shah, who was one of the members of the investment committee that approved the investment decisions related to certain Fixed Maturity Plan (FMP) schemes, as per the order. They have been directed to pay the penalties within 45 days. The case pertains to six FMP schemes that matured in April and May 2019, which held investments in debt securities issued by Edisons Utility Works Pvt Ltd and Konti Infrapower & Multiventures Pvt Ltd, belonging to the Essel Group. The debt securities were secured by pledge of equity shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd by its promoter Cyquator Media Services. Further, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company (AMC) entered into an agreement with promoters and other promoter entities of Essel Group to extend the maturity of securities of various Essel Group entities to September 30, 2019. Consequently, investors of all the six schemes were not paid full amount on maturity based on the Net Asset Value of the schemes. Sebi found that Kotak Mahindra Trustee Company, being a trustee of Kotak AMC, failed to disclose scheme related information, particularly regarding the adverse situation related to Essel Group companies, to its unitholders accurately and in a timely manner, despite being aware of the same since January 2019. According to Sebi, information of Essel promoters not providing additional cover when the margin call triggered and the decision of AMC and trustees to extend the maturity of the securities, all being information having adverse bearing on the investments of investors were not communicated to the investors when the events took place. ""Lapses and violations have been observed on the part of the noticees (seven entities) with regard to lack of due diligence and consequently negligence while investing in Essel Group companies as well as with regard to maturity date of the security exceeding the maturity date schemes, the six FMP schemes... and not being wound up at the end of their maturities and being partially redeemed at the end of their maturity dates,"" Sebi said in the 104-page order. Further, it observed non-compliance with principles of fair valuation while valuing the debt securities or Zero Coupon Non Convertible Debenture (ZCNCDs) of the issuers, and inadequate disclosures to investors of the six FMP schemes by these entities. According to the regulator, interests of the investors has been affected negatively on account of the infractions on the part of the noticees. Accordingly, Sebi imposed a fine of ₹40 lakh on Kotak Mahindra Trustee Company, Nilesh Shah ( ₹30 lakh), Iyer ( ₹25 lakh), Agarwal ( ₹20 lakh), Bhatt ( ₹10 lakh), Bisen ( ₹15 lakh) and Gaurang Shah ( ₹20 lakh). The order came after Sebi noticed that the investors of certain FMPs launched by the Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund were not paid their full proceeds based on the declared NAV of the said schemes as on their respective maturity dates. In August 2021, Sebi had asked the AMC to refund a part of the investment management and advisory fees collected from the unit holders of the six FMP schemes with 15 per cent interest per annum. In addition, the regulator had restrained Kotak AMC from launching any new fixed-maturity plans for six months and imposed a penalty of ₹50 lakh on the fund house in the matter. Later in October that year, the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) partly stayed the Sebi order.

Updated: 30 Jun 2022,M&M goes back to basics to claw back SUV market share,https://www.livemint.com/auto-news/mm-goes-back-to-basics-to-claw-back-suv-market-share-11656351733371.html,"Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd’s (M&M) latest bet to claw back market share in the sport utility vehicle (SUV) market by winning urban customers, the Scorpio-N, is expected to drive up volumes for the automaker in the growing, mid-sized and premium SUV segments. The Scorpio-N is part of M&M’s strategy to appeal to a new demographic by reinforcing and reshaping its existing brand appeal. The runaway success of the new Thar is an example of that strategy. At a combined annual market size of nearly 500,000 units, the C and D categories of SUVs as they’re respectively known, together form close to 16% of the total passenger vehicle market in India. The Scorpio-N, designed on a new platform with “no carryover from the existing Scorpio"", is likely to benefit from a positive rub-off effect of recent successes like the Thar and XUV700, potentially limiting the risk of cannibalization within its own portfolio as it looks to attract a new set of urban customers, according to industry experts. Mahindra & Mahindra’s market share in the utility vehicle segment had fallen to 15% in FY22, from 53% a decade ago in FY12, as competition from South Korean and homegrown carmakers continues to intensify. Success of its new Scorpio, which also saw the model’s market share fall to nearly 2% from 22% a decade ago, will be critical for it to reclaim marketshare in the UV segment, where it is currently the fourth-largest player after Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and Tata Motors. With sustained demand for new launches and better supply chain management, M&M could see monthly UV sales to rise to 30,000 units from the second half of this financial year, from its current production run rate of about 24,000 vehicles, according to ICICI Securities. M&M can produce up to 6,000 units of the Scorpio-N a month. However, the brokerage firm expects the aggressive pricing of M&M’s portfolio cars to continue into FY24, keeping auto industry margins under pressure. Meanwhile, M&M expects to face fewer production disruptions going forward as it factors in in high demand for top-end trims of the Scorpio-N, and plans its parts supplies accordingly. “For the XUV700, for example, 75% of the sales come from two top-end variants. For the Scorpio-N, we are preparing for high demand to come from the top-end versions. We are better prepared from a chip procurement, planning etc perspective than we were at the time of the launch of the XUV700,"" Rajesh Jejurikar, executive director, Auto and Farm Sector, M&M told reporters. According to M&M, there is an order backlog of 78,000 units for the XUV700 with a waiting period of 18-24 months and a booking rate of 9,000 vehicles a month. “The Scorpio brand which had a 14% market share in the UV market in FY12, had fallen to about 3% in FY22. The success of this model launch is critical for M&M’s overall market share gains. We build in an overall UV and PV market share gain of about 160 basis points and 140 basis points over FY22-24E to 16.6% and 8.7%, respectively for M&M. The order book stands at 170,000 units as on May end,"" said Jay Kale, senior vice president, Elara Capital."

The partnership of almost two years stands out, as tie-ups between auto companies invariably end up on the chopping board. Cracks start to appear within two or three years. The sector has a history of divorces following short honeymoons: Ford-Mahindra; Tata Motors-Volkswagen (the joint venture stalled and was called off before take-off); Mahindra-Renault and so on. In Toyota-Suzuki’s case, however, the relationship has been growing stronger and deeper in defiance of the history of car-makers’ demonstrated record of finding it hard to blend cultures of manufacturing and business alliances over the long term. The net outcome of the marriage between Toyota and Suzuki could prove to be an automotive landmark. What’s different about the Toyota-Suzuki dalliance? For one, there’s a crystal-clear business case for who brings what to the table. Suzuki (Maruti) is the undisputed market champ in India in terms of revenue, with proven expertise in two distinct domains: lightweight manufacturing and small cars. Toyota, on the other hand, is revered in Japan, where it is the number one maker of cars, and an established leader in hybrid and electric automotive technology; its hybrid car, Prius, has been around for 25 years.

Outstanding customer pre-orders for the seven-seater XUV700, which the Indian automaker launched in August, are running to around 70,000, Executive Director Rajesh Jejurikar said in an interview last week. While the chip shortage has eased from a peak late last year, Mahindra is still experiencing some supply chain pain points, he said. The Mumbai-based $15.8 billion cars-to-factory equipment conglomerate took the wraps off its Scorpio-N late Monday, an automobile it bills as the “Big Daddy of SUVs."" Mahindra is hoping consumers in India will continue their embrace of larger, gas guzzling vehicles even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi commits to making the South Asian nation a net-zero carbon emitting one by 2070. Mahindra doesn’t have a strong electric vehicle line up -- it currently sells one passenger EV, the e-Verito, though it does have a much bigger presence in the electric three-wheeler market. But Jejurikar said range anxiety and lack of charging infrastructure mean the company doesn’t see a tipping point for EVs until between 2025 to 2027. By that stage, electric SUV sales are expected to comprise about 20% to 25% of Mahindra’s sales, he said. Until then, a major focus for Mahindra, which also last year unveiled a new look logo, will be defending its market share in the large-format SUV segment from Tata Motors Ltd. and Hyundai Motor Co.  Data from automotive business intelligence provider JATO Dynamics show Mahindra had a leading revenue market share of 17.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, followed by Tata, Hyundai and Hyundai affiliate Kia. Mahindra isn’t the only carmaker to be suffering long chip-induced wait times. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., the automaker that sells every other car on the nation’s roads and positions itself in the smaller vehicle segment, doesn’t see the semiconductor crunch finishing even in 2023. But “with more engineering input going into how to beat the problem, production this year will definitely be better than last year,"" Chairman R.C.

Fuel prices have remained unchanged for more than a month but have already dealt a blow to rural demand as is evident from, what industry executives are calling, consumer reluctance to buy new two-wheelers. Instead, borrowers who used to buy new two-wheelers every three to four years are repairing their existing vehicles to use them for longer, said industry experts. On 21 May, the government had reduced excise duty on petrol by ₹8 per litre and on diesel by ₹6 per litre. “Two-wheeler demand is subdued partly because of the uneven rural recovery and also because the cost of vehicles has gone up in the last few years. That apart, fuel prices have increased and, therefore, both the cost of ownership and that of running (the vehicle), have gone up,"" said Y.S. Chakravarti, managing director and chief executive, Shriram City Union Finance. Shriram City Union lends to small businesses, and provides gold loans and two-wheeler loans. People are not changing their vehicles as frequently as they were earlier, probably trying to postpone purchases, Chakravarti said. “This is almost uniform across the country but is more evident in markets where two-wheeler penetration is high such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, coastal Andhra Pradesh, and parts of Telangana,"" he said. Sales of two-wheelers and tractors are used as an indicator of rural demand. Domestic two-wheeler sales rose 9% in May over April, tractor sales were down 8% in the same period, according to data compiled by CareEdge Research. Industry watchers also said the bottom of the pyramid has been the most impacted by covid and the subsequent runaway price rise. Some fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies have recently said they are witnessing demand compression in rural areas. “This is not limited to high fuel prices, but is also because their purchasing power has contracted,"" said Prakash Agarwal, director and head of financial institutions, India Ratings and Research. People have seen incomes drop and, therefore, discretionary spending has come down, Agarwal said. There is a fair bit of pressure on rural demand and while the government has supported grain distribution, rural India has suffered, he said. Rural sentiments have turned positive, but customers remain cautious, Ramesh Iyer, vice-chairman and managing director of Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Ltd, told analysts. Mahindra Finance is a frontline, rural-focused non-bank lender. “When I say customers are a little cautious, it is not that they do not have money. They have money but they probably do not want to spend all they have,"" Iyer said, pointing out that the two-wheeler segment is not doing as well as other vehicles. Others said it is too soon to predict how the rural economy will behave, given that healthy demand from the fourth quarter of 2021-22 has spilled over to April and May. “April and May 2022 business has largely been better than usual, on the back of the traction seen since Q4 FY22, but could vary among non-banking financial company (NBFC) lenders. The last two years were affected by the lockdown in 2020 and the second wave in 2021. Incrementally, demand could have started to demonstrate some bit of slowdown,"" said A.M. Karthik, vice-president (financial sector ratings), Icra."

Credit card spends grew 118% year-on-year and 8% month-on-month on the back of strong e-commerce spending and high-value spending on travel and tourism and discretionary purchases, according to Reserve Bank of India data.

Total credit card spending in May was ₹1.13 trillion against ₹1.05 trillion spending in April and ₹52,200 crore in May last year.  Indusind Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank saw the highest incremental growth in terms of credit card spends at 17% and 15%, respectively, while all other players grew in the 4-9% range. American Express, on the other hand, saw a decline of 2% month-on-month.  “Latest data releases from RBI reveal that credit card spends have been very strong touching an all-time high level in May 2022,"" said Macquarie Research in a note.

The total number of outstanding credit cards in the system grew 23.2% year-on-year to 76.9m in May 2022, the highest in the past 27 months. In terms of new card additions, HDFC bank saw the highest incremental card additions with 38,000 new cards being added in the same month. The bank has also been seeing an increase in marketshare in credit card spends since April.  The bank’s marketshare in credit card spends stood at 27.7% in May compared to 27.6% in April and 26.6% in March. This gain in marketshare comes after HDFC Bank launched 1 million new credit cards and relaunched three credit cards after RBI lifted the ban on new credit card issuances in August last year.  Axis Bank on the other hand saw a fall in marketshare in spends despite adding large number of cards in May."

""Given that we still have close to one week to go before the actual launch of Vitara Brezza facelift, we have used the search intensity scores 1-week prior to launch for the other models as well,"" the report stated. Google Trends, which tracks the search volume on Google, gives an estimated time-series of relative search volume for particular keywords. As per Google Trends data, analysed by brokerage research firm Kotak Institutional equities, Vitara Brezza facelift is doing marginally better in capturing the imagination of potential buyers as compared to the newly launched Hyundai Venue facelift. However, the average search intensity for Vitara Brezza facelift is lower as compared to Baleno and Ertiga facelifts. Average search intensity for Mahindra Scorpio N is almost 2.5X that of Brezza, which can be attributed to aggressive marketing campaigns. “While we await details on pricing and features; however, we do not expect new Brezza facelift to be the game changer,"" Kotak's report added. SUV, or the sports utility vehicle, are becoming the car of choice across consumer classes and geographies as well as for manufacturers for business growth. Currently, competitive intensity in the compact SUV segment is very high as compared to FY2017. In FY2017, there were only 2 offerings in the compact SUV segment versus >6 offerings currently. Given the category is well established with multiple offerings across attractive price points and rich features by various OEMs, the brokerage believes it will be challenging for Maruti Suzuki to enjoy similar success of FY2017. “There is a correlation of 0.6 and 0.7 between 1M average search intensity and subsequent three-month and six-month sales respectively of the newly launched models. While we expect Brezza sales for the company to pick-up in the coming months; however we expect marginal market share gain in the compact SUV segment for Maruti Suzuki based on Google Trends data,"" as per the report."

The RBI has hiked rates by 0.90% in two moves and is expected to do more to contain inflation. With fixed deposits acting as one of the crucial investment options, following the rate hikes by the RBI, questions were raised about trailing deposit rate increases and the propensity among banks to hike lending rates immediately but deny benefits to the depositors. While earlier this month, the RBI hiked the repo rate by 0.50% after its monetary policy meeting on June 8, taking the total hike to 0.9% in 36 days. At a time when concerns are being raised about lenders delaying deposit rate hikes amid the overall rate increases, here are the new FD interest rates for amounts less than ₹2 crore:   Additionally, Yes Bank on Tuesday introduced a product where the interest earned on a term deposit is linked to the RBI's repo rate. Till now, an external benchmark-linked rate has been popular on the lending side, but the same was not the case for deposits. The RBI has hiked rates by 0.90 per cent in two moves and is expected to do more to contain inflation. Yes Bank, in its statement, said its new offering will allow customers to enjoy dynamic returns on their fixed deposits (FDs) as the rate of interest will be linked to the prevailing repo rate. The floating rate FDs can be availed for a tenure of 1 year to less than 3 years. The lender's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Prashant Kumar said this is one of a kind product and there has been careful deliberation behind the launch aimed at enhancing its retail product offerings."

The Tata Sons Chairman joined other industry leaders such as Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra, RPG Enterprises Chairman Harsh Goenka, Biocon Ltd Chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and Apollo Hospitals Group Joint Managing Director Sangita Reddy who have come out in support of the scheme. ""Agnipath is not just a great opportunity for the youth to serve the nation's defence forces but it will also make available a very disciplined and trained youth for the industry, including the Tata Group,"" he said in a statement. Chandrasekaran added, ""We at the Tata group recognise the potential of the Agniveers and welcome the opportunity this represents."" Hundreds of people have been arrested and the role of coaching centres is being probed in connection with the violent protests that broke out after the government last week unveiled the Agnipath scheme. Under this scheme, the youths between 17-and-a-half and 21 years would be inducted into the three services for a four-year tenure. Around 25% of the recruits will be retained for regular service. The Union Cabinet had also approved the scheme on June 14. The youth selected under this scheme will be known as Agniveers. The government projected this scheme as a major overhaul of the decades-old selection process to enhance the youthful profile of the services, but the protesters are demanding its rollback claiming that it will rob recruits of job security and other benefits. The government said that the scheme provides an attractive financial package, will entail armed forces having a more youthful profile and provides an opportunity for Agniveers to train in the best institutions and enhance their skills and qualifications. While the Centre has announced several incentives and concessions for Agniveers, the three services on Sunday warned those who indulged in violence and arson will not be inducted. Meanwhile, the chiefs of the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force are scheduled to separately meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 21 and would brief him on the Agnipath recruitment scheme."

Currently, there has been a wide-ranging agitation across the country regarding the new recruitment scheme in the Indian defence forces, called Agnipath, under which the recruit will be able to serve the Army/Navy/Air Force for four years. The youngsters, who are opposing this Agnipath scheme, say that this will increase the unemployment rate in the country and also uncertainty in their careers. However, Anand Mahindra has opposing views regarding the Agnipath scheme, which are in line with what the Centre, and the chief of three defence forces have been saying. Mahindra said, ""When the scheme was mooted last year I stated-and repeat-the discipline and skills Agniveers gain will make them eminently employable"". He said he is saddened by the violence around the Agnipath program. The business tycoon added, ""The Mahindra Group welcomes the opportunity to recruit such trained and capable young people"". Subsequently, a Twitter user asked the industrialist what job Mahindra Group would give to Agniveers. Anand Mahindra responded, “Large potential for employment of Agniveers in the Corporate Sector. With leadership, teamwork, and physical training, Agniveers provide market-ready professional solutions to industry, covering the full spectrum from operations to administration & supply chain management"".  Separately, the Centre also announced a slew of concessions for Agniveers to pacify the agitators. The Centre approved a proposal to reserve 10% of the job vacancies in the Ministry of Defence for Agniveers meeting requisite eligibility criteria and also decided to give priority to them in the recruitment of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and Assam Rifles. Several state governments like Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Arunachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Karnataka have announced to give Agniveers priority in state government jobs. While the government points out that the 'Agnipath' scheme gives a golden opportunity to the youth to join the defence system and serve the country, Congress had said the recruitment policy is controversial, carries multiple risks, subverts the long-standing traditions and ethos of the armed forces and there is no guarantee that the soldiers recruited under the scheme will be better trained and motivated to defend the country. Agniveers will be enrolled for a service duration of 4 years including the training period. After four years, only 25% of the Agniveers will be retained or re-enlisted in the regular cadre based on merit, willingness, and medical fitness. These 25% Agniveers will then serve for a full term of another 15 years. However, a senior Army officer on Sunday clarified that the scheme will not be rolled back and said that it is the ""only progressive step to make the country young"". Meanwhile, the registration process for the first batch of Agniveers will begin on June 24 and the online examination would be held on July 24."

Mint asked a panel of experts whether this is a market for buyers or sellers. Here’s what Dalal Street mavens Shankar Sharma, vice-chairman and managing director (MD), First Global; Nilesh Shah, group president and MD, Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund; Deepak Shenoy, founder and CEO, Capitalmind; Nikhil Kamath, co-founder, Zerodha; had to say about the selloff by foreign investors, opportunities in this market and the ways to make money. Edited excerpts. Will correction last longer?  Kamath: Indian markets seem expensive and even today on a relative basis, we have corrected lesser than other countries. Generally, in market cycles, things get a lot worse before they start to get better. Over the next two years, there will be more pain and the pain will last long.  Shah: A lot will depend upon how various global events will shape up. What if tomorrow there is a political solution to the Ukraine-Russia war, and oil prices come down. In that scenario, certainly, the market outlook will be brighter.  Shenoy: I am very bullish longer-term, but I just don’t feel that right now,  (market condition) is great. Excess liquidity has come down by about 5 trillion in the Indian economy. In such a situation you can be bullish about the economy, but the markets will not perform correspondingly because liquidity is what drives the market.                   "

It has launched upgraded Celerio, and mid-cycle refresh of Baleno as well as XL6. Going forward, Maruti Suzuki would be launching new models with four new SUVs, platform upgrade (Alto) and mid-cycle refresh (Brezza). Four new SUV brands are lined up for launch over the next couple of years to plug-in the gaps in its portfolio. Based on brokerage Motilal Oswal's channel checks, Maruti is planning to replicate its highly successful product laddering strategy in the SUV segment, thereby giving customers an option of an SUV at every price point. While the SUV based on Baleno platform will provide product laddering between Brezza and S-Cross, the SUV co-developed with Toyota will open up the UV1 segment (currently dominated by Hyundai Creta and Kia Seltos) and Jimny would compete in the niche segment of Thar. Further, it plans to launch a mid-size MPV sitting in between best-sellers such as Ertiga and Toyota’s Innova. SUV, or the sports utility vehicle, are becoming the car of choice across consumer classes and geographies as well as for manufacturers for business growth. Maruti's market share in SUVs has been but it has set itself a target for growing this with new SUV launches in the coming years. “Our analysis suggests that market shares in the PV segment are very highly correlated with the product lifecycles. MSIL benefits from its favorable product pipeline over FY14-19 with market share improvement of ~9pp to ~51%, benefitting from the launches of Celerio, Ciaz, S-Cross, Baleno, Brezza, Ignis, XL6 and Espresso,"" Motilal Oswal said in a note. Subsequently, the lack of Maruti's product launches coupled with substantial product launches from competition led to a declining market share of 8pp to 43.4% over FY19-22 for the automaker. While Kia ramped-up to 6.1% market share since entry in India in August 2019 with four new products. Conversely, Hyundai lost 260bp market share YoY (to 14.8%) in FY22 as it only had two model upgrades since Jun’20 along with Alcazar launch. Tata Motors gained market share to 12.2% over FY20-22, driven by five new products since 2017. Mahindra & Mahindra gained 160bp market share to 7.4% (of the domestic PV market) since the launch of Thar in October 2021.  "
