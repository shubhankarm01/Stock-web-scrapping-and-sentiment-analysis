This advice by investment guru Warren Buffet has remained the guiding principle for Nilesh Shah where it concerns his investments. “I invest as if I am not going to touch it (the investments) for the next decade or so,"" says Shah, the managing director at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company Ltd. As with many CEOs and senior executives of companies, a large part of Shah’s wealth, too, is tied to his employer. Most of his personal wealth (60%) is in equity—either in employee stock options (ESOPs) or shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank that he acquired long ago. (He owns some shares in the physical format as well so that he doesn’t get tempted to sell them.) Another 15% of his assets is held in equity mutual funds, mostly in the large cap and large-and-mid cap category segments. Shah does not invest in passive funds, except where it is required as per market regulator Sebi’s rules. Under these regulations, as the CEO of Kotak Mahindra AMC, Shah has to invest in all the schemes of the fund house. But these rules came into effect only in October 2021, and hence such mutual fund (MF) units are a very small part of Shah’s portfolio. Interestingly, Shah relies on a distributor to transact in MFs rather than opting for direct plans.       "

With fixed deposits acting as one of the crucial investment options, following the rate hikes by the RBI, questions were raised about trailing deposit rate increases and the propensity among banks to hike lending rates immediately but deny benefits to the depositors. While earlier this month, the RBI hiked the repo rate by 0.50% after its monetary policy meeting on June 8, taking the total hike to 0.9% in 36 days. At a time when concerns are being raised about lenders delaying deposit rate hikes amid the overall rate increases, here are the new FD interest rates for amounts less than ₹2 crore:   Additionally, Yes Bank on Tuesday introduced a product where the interest earned on a term deposit is linked to the RBI's repo rate.

The RBI has hiked rates by 0.90 per cent in two moves and is expected to do more to contain inflation. Yes Bank, in its statement, said its new offering will allow customers to enjoy dynamic returns on their fixed deposits (FDs) as the rate of interest will be linked to the prevailing repo rate. The floating rate FDs can be availed for a tenure of 1 year to less than 3 years. The lender's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Prashant Kumar said this is one of a kind product and there has been careful deliberation behind the launch aimed at enhancing its retail product offerings."

It promises to focus some laser-sharp questions even at regulator Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The genesis of the kerfuffle is an analysts' conference a few days ago where Kotak introduced his son Jay as the new co-head of the bank’s digital initiatives, aligning the young executive’s three-year experience with the existing head’s 17-year career. Jay’s three-year apprenticeship under the tutelage of Uday’s trusted executive director Shanti Ekambaram is his qualification. And, of course, a management degree from Harvard University. Predictably, much chatter and gossip-mongering followed Uday’s announcement, especially because the conference witnessed both addressing each other as “my son"" and “my father"". Defenders of the young man’s promotion say that youth can provide invaluable inputs for the bank’s digital business; challengers are asking whether the appointment process was fair, evaluating Jay’s competence against other equally-qualified contenders, or whether his family name was the only criterion.

Updated: 08 May 2022,"RBI repo rate hike effect: These banks raised rates on lending, deposits",https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/rbi-repo-rate-hike-effect-these-banks-raised-rates-on-lending-deposits-11652017460013.html,"Right after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised India's repo rate by 40 basis points, the banking sector mimicked the same by increasing interest rates in lending and deposit schemes. From major banks like ICICI Bank, PNB, and Bank of Baroda to even small finance banks, have joined the bandwagon of raising lending and deposits rate. In general terms, a repo rate hike makes borrowing costlier and savings more attractive. The changes in policy repo rate make a significant impact on both lending and deposits interest rates. While in a scenario of a higher repo rate, the cost of funds goes higher for banks - resulting in rising interest rates for home loans, car loans, and personal loans - which in return hit your pockets when you pay your monthly instalments (EMIs) back to the lender. However, the case is different for depositors. A rate hike gives room to banks for raising interest rates on deposits and hence making fixed deposits and savings accounts attractive for customers to park their money and earn extra on them. After RBI's surprise rate hike, Anjana Potti, Partner, J Sagar Associates (JSA) said, ""The geopolitical situation caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine is weighing on all markets. Market watchers across the world have their eye on the US Federal Reserve which is likely to announce a decision to increase rates later tonight. Central banks in many countries are raising rates to counter the effects of inflation. These costs of borrowing had fallen to record lows during the pandemic to bolster growth."" Following this trend, the RBI has increased its repo rate from 4.00% to 4.40% and according to the JSA Partner this is likely to have a significant impact on the market including on: 1. Short-term deposits – short and mid-term rates always rise quickest in response to any change in the interest rate cycle. 2. Retail borrowing: Interest rates are likely to be higher for new borrowers. Existing borrowers with floating interest rates will also be affected. Here's a list of banks that have raised their interest rates on either lending benchmarks or fixed deposits or savings after RBI's repo rate hike. 1. ICICI Bank: On the same day, when RBI surprised markets by hiking the repo rate by 40 basis points to 4.4%, ICICI Bank also changed its external benchmark lending rate with effect from May 4, 2022. It said on its website, ""ICICI Bank External Benchmark Lending Rate"" (I-EBLR) is referenced to RBI Policy Repo Rate with a mark-up over Repo Rate. I-EBLR is 8.10% p.a.p.m. effective May 4, 2022."" 2. Punjab National Bank: PNB increased its repo-linked lending rate (RLLR) by 40 basis points. However, the new RLLR will come into effect for existing customers on June 1, while for new customers it has changed from May 7, 2022. In its regulatory filing, PNB said ""the Repo Linked Lending Rate (RLLR) has been changed from 6.50% to 6.90% w.e.f. 01.06.2022 for existing customers. For new customers, the revised RLLR will be effective from 07.05.2022."" 3. Bank of Baroda: Interest rates on various loans linked with Baroda's repo-linked lending rate (BRLLR) have been hiked from May 5, 2022. The bank informed on its website that for retail loans applicable BRLLR is 6.90% which is a combination of the current repo rate of 4.40% plus a mark-up of 2.50% and the addition of a spread of 0.25%. ""For Retail Loans applicable BRLLR is 6.90% w.e.f. 05.05.2022 (Current RBI Repo Rate:4.40%+Mark-Up-2.50%), S.P.0.25%,"" the bank stated on its website. 4. HDFC Bank: The major housing finance provider HDFC has increased its Retail Prime Lending Rate (RPLR) on Housing loans, on which its Adjustable Rate Home Loans (ARHL) are benchmarked, by 30 basis points, with effect from May 9, 2022. 5. Indian Bank: Indian Bank announced on Saturday that it has reviewed the Lending Rate for all Loans/Advances linked with Policy Repo Rate and revised the Lending Rate linked with Policy Repo Rate based on Repo from 4.00% to 4.40%. That said, the bank revised the lending rate for new customers with effect from May 9, while the existing customers will see the revision from June 1. 6. Kotak Mahindra Bank: This private sector bank raised its fixed deposit rates across tenures for retail customers on their deposits below ₹2 crore with effect from May 6. Now, the rate of interest on the popular, 390-day (12 months and 25 days) deposit has been increased by 30 bps to 5.5% and that on the 23-month deposit by 35 bps to 5.6%.

Senior citizens earn 6.50% rates. The remaining rates are unchanged. 8.

For tenures above 5 years to 10 tenures, a regular FD has a 6% rate and senior citizens get 6.80%. 9. Union Bank of India: The government-owned bank increased its savings bank deposits' interest rates, however, on specific savings amounts. The rates will be effective from June 1, 2022. Union Bank increased rates on savings deposits above ₹100 crore to ₹500 crore by 20 basis points to 3.10% compared to the existing 2.90%. The rate has been increased by 50 basis points and 65 basis points on savings above ₹500 crore to ₹1,000 crore, and above ₹1,000 crore from the current 2.90% each to 3.40% and 3.55%."

Updated: 27 Apr 2022,Strong loan growth to push bank earnings up,https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/strong-loan-growth-to-push-bank-earnings-up-11650991980440.html,"Indian banks are expected to report healthy operating performance in the March quarter, backed by strong credit growth and modest addition of bad loans, analysts said. So far, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are among the large banks to report quarterly earnings, posting net profit growth of 23% and 59%, respectively. Others, including Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, are slated to report their March quarter earnings in the coming weeks. According to analysts at ICICI Securities, bank credit is expected to grow at more than 9% from a year earlier in the three months through March. The brokerage expects lenders it tracks to report 4-8% sequential loan growth. Encouragingly, corporate credit, too, is contributing to incremental growth, along with retail and commercial banking segments, the analysts said. “Kotak Mahindra Bank, AU Small Finance Bank, Axis Bank, Bandhan Bank are estimated to outpace peers with over 16% y-o-y (year on year) credit growth. State Bank of India, Indusind Bank, Yes Bank, IDFC First Bank are likely to report 9-12% growth; while RBL Bank and City Union Bank will continue to lag average industry growth,"" it said in a report on 6 April.  The brokerage said though there will be no direct impact on lenders from the current geopolitical situation, higher input prices and stretched working capital cycles will trigger short-term financing requirements. That apart, impact on bilateral trades globally, disruption in payment mechanisms, and rate volatility will affect foreign exchange revenues. Not just in the March quarter, analysts expect that over the long term, too, slippages into the non-performing category will moderate. However, the pool of restructured loans would need close attention. Estimates by credit rating agencies peg the total restructured book at 2.5% of loans, owing to higher recasts in retail and the small business segments. “While we could see some slippages from the restructuring book, many banks pegged the overall impact to be 15-20%, which appears to be manageable in the context of provisions held on restructured loans, besides contingency buffers,"" Motilal Oswal said in a report on 25 April. While asset quality within the small and medium enterprise (SME) sectors could remain under pressure, overall gross bad loans are likely to moderate, led by robust trends in the corporate and retail segments, according to the Motilal report cited above. Others said hardening bond yields during the March quarter would hit banks’ treasury income. At India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank, other income growth rose 0.6% to ₹7,637.1 crore from a year earlier. It reported a loss on sale and revaluation of investments of ₹40.3 crore. Analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services expect an overall net interest income growth of 18% on the back of healthy credit growth and stable margins. “However, lower treasury gains and elevated operating expenses amid business normalization and higher tech spends should keep pre-provisioning operating profit growth in check at 4% y-o-y,"" the Emkay report said on 8 April."

Updated: 08 Apr 2022,Yes Bank shares shot up 22% this week. What's driving banking stock — explained,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/yes-bank-shares-shot-up-22-this-week-what-s-driving-banking-stock-explained-11649403781153.html,"Yes Bank shares have surged from ₹12.80 to ₹15.90 in last one week, delivering more than 22 per cent return to its shareholders in this period. According to stock market experts, Yes Bank share price rally can be attributed to three major news — private equity (PE) group Carlyle considering to acquire 10 per cent stake in Yes Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank board's approval to pump ₹500 crore in Yes Bank and recent rating upgrade by CARE rating agency to its debt instruments from BBB to BBB+. They said that Yes Bank shares have given fresh breakout at ₹15 and currently this private lender stock looking in 'uptrend' on chart pattern. Speaking on the reason for rise in Yes Bank share price; Ravi Singhal, Vice Chairman at GCL Securities said, ""Yes Bank share price today is surging on the news that PE group Carlyle is mulling to buy 10 per cent stake in the private lender by investing to the tune of $500 to $600 million. Dalal Street is buzzing with this news and today's rise in the stock can be attributed to this news only. market is looking at this stock a good signal from investors as we saw Kotak Mahindra Bank board approving ₹500 crore investment in private lender. So, these two developments from the investment front are working as major catalyst for Yes Bank share price rally."" Hinting at rumours in regard to merger and acquisition related news fueling Yes Bank shares; Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart Ltd said, ""Yes Bank is surging sharply for the last few days as there are rumors of its acquisition by a big player. We are seeing multiple mergers and acquisitions in the BFSI industry, therefore, such kind of buzz for Yes bank can't be ruled out. Actually, the banking sector is looking in a very good stage for multiyear growth after a long period of pain where we can expect a decent performance by small banks like Yes Bank in future or we can say that worst is behind us of this company, therefore, some investors are looking it as a bargain buying."" On how rating upgrade has pushed Yes Bank share price rally; Sonam Srivastava, Founder at Wright Research said, ""The shares of Yes Bank have jumped up over 20% in a week after the rating agency CARE has upgraded their debt instruments to BBB+ from BBB. The agency said that the bank’s continued demonstration of stabilization of operations and growth in business and continued improvement in profitability with stable asset quality parameters amidst concerns over Covid-19 related stress has led to this upgrade. However, the bank still has a great proportion of stressed advances that need to monitor."" The SEBI registered investment advisor went on to add, ""With the banking & financial sector on the rise, we are bullish on banks and with this notable upgrade, we are betting on the momentum on Yes Bank to continue."" Sharing important levels on technical chart pattern, Santosh Meena said, ""Technically, Yes Bank share has broken out a key hurdle of ₹15 that may lead to further bullish momentum in this counter towards ₹17 to ₹20 levels. On the downside, ₹15 should act as an immediate and strong support level while ₹13 will be a key support level.""

Updated: 05 Apr 2022,I did what is right for the company: BharatPe CEO Suhail Sameer,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/i-did-what-is-right-for-the-company-bharatpe-ceo-suhail-sameer-11649162104117.html,"NEW DELHI : Breaking his silence over allegations of pushing out embattled co-founder Ashneer Grover, BharatPe CEO Suhail Sameer said he did what was right for the company and investors, and to protect his reputation. BharatPe, which allows shop owners to make digital payments through QR codes, last month, stripped Grover of all titles and positions after a third-party audit alleged grave governance lapses under him. Grover, who had to go on leave in January following allegations of using abusive language against Kotak Mahindra Bank staff and of fraudulent practices, had accused Sameer of siding with the investors to remove him from office. ""Most of them (allegations) I buy,"" Sameer told PTI in an interview. ""I did what is right for the investors. I did what is right for the company, isn't that why I am here."" Ashneer, he said, was ""a deep personal friend"". ""We were like very very close,"" he said. ""But my job here is not to be a great friend. My job is to do what is right."" Following the allegations of financial irregularities under Grover, BharatPe engaged a law firm and risk advisory consultants to conduct a more detailed investigation. BharatPe first sacked Madhuri Jain which was followed by Grover resigning and the company stripping him of the co-founder and other titles over alleged ""extensive misappropriation of company funds"" by ""creating fake vendors"" to siphon money and using ""company expense accounts"" to ""enrich themselves and fund their lavish lifestyles."" ""I sort of have an incredible reputation to live. This is my last job in life (and) I will not let anything come on my reputation. So I would do what is right for the company, I would do what is right for our shareholders even if it means something which is against one of us,"" Sameer said. He said he could have stepped away if his conduct was faulted. ""So I did what you would expect a CEO to do,"" he said. ""So, there is no question of allegations or siding with someone."" Grover had reportedly stated he was manipulated by Sameer and the company's general counsel Sumeet Singh to go on leave. Sameer said happenings were ""turbulent"". They were ""even more turbulent for my general counsel (Singh). He (Singh) was Ashneer's childhood friend,"" he said. ""We are two people on whom all the allegations were made. But we were just two place holders. Anyone who was in the governance council would have got the same allegations. We are not taking it to heart. Hopefully, a few years later, Ashneer and I will again be friends."" The board of BharatPe has received the final reports of the governance review but is yet to deliberated on it. The board may meet later this month to discuss it but there is also a view that since Ashneer has put in his papers, there is no need for further action, he said. ""It is the board's call. It is premature for me to say it on behalf of the board (what it will do on the report). Right now, focus is to get the business to growth (and make) employees comfortable,"" he said. He said all the board members have got the reports and they have sort of gone through them. ""At some appropriate time frame, we will sort of come together and say, therefore what do we do with it."" Grover currently owns a 9.5 per cent stake in BharatPe while Shashvat Nakrani -- the other co-founder -- owns 7.8 per cent. Investor Sequoia Capital India is the largest shareholder in BharatPe with a 19.6 per cent stake followed by Coatue at 12.4 per cent and Ribbit Capital at 11 per cent. Reacting to BharatPe's decision, Grover, last month, stated he was appalled at the personal nature of the company's statement but not surprised. ""It comes from a position of personal hatred and low thinking,"" he had said. ""I would want to learn who among Amarchand, PwC and A&M has started doing an audit on 'lavishness' of one's lifestyle?"" Grover had also questioned the role of former SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar, an independent director on BharatPe board."

Kotak, who has been serving as non-executive chairman of beleaguered Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS), has resolved nearly 55% of the group’s outstanding debt over the last three-and-a-half years. Nearly ₹55,000 crore of IL&FS’s total debt of ₹99,000 crore has been resolved, IL&FS managing director CS Rajan said this week. Therefore Goenka heaped praises on Kotak for working relentlessly for more than three years to bring ₹55,000 crore into the system. 'Such selfless efforts to save national institutions need to be lauded,' Goenka wrote on Twitter. Now, Kotak has announced the end of his term as the chairman of the six-member board from April 2. Rajan will succeed him. Three-and-a-half years ago, the Centre had asked banker Uday Kotak to head a new board to salvage the largest non-banking infra lender IL&FS that went belly up in October 2018. Kotak said, “Our aim was to keep the assets as going concern and maximize creditor value. These are national assets which we needed to protect,"" he said. “Maximum amount of money was returned to public sector banks. I want to credit the PSU banks for being smarter as they lent primarily to SPVs against securities of assets and project cash flows. The so-called smart cats which depended on rating agencies came in unsecured,"" he added. The learning from the IL&FS experience is to avoid complex, hydra-like structures, which get out of control, and proper regulatory control is needed over such entities, Kotak said. “IL&FS is a case study for how we think about the future of structure, regulation and governance, how we build a resolution framework in areas which are no man’s land,"" he added. As a banker, the biggest learning from this experience is to not lend where you don’t understand the business structure. He said banks must do their own diligence, not rely on rating agencies etc.,Kotak said."
