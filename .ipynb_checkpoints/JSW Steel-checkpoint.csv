Updated: 30 Jun 2022,Steel demand will grow at robust pace this decade: Sajjan Jindal,https://www.livemint.com/industry/structural-demand-drivers-for-commodities-remain-intact-sajjan-jindal-11656480570048.html,"MUMBAI : Although global growth expectations have moderated recently, the structural demand drivers for commodities like steel remain intact, said Sajjan Jindal, chairman and managing director of JSW Steel Ltd in a message to shareholders in the company’s annual report. “The financial year gone by was a mixed bag, with most major economies rebounding from the negative effects of COVID-19. However, commodity price volatility, soaring energy prices, lingering supply chain challenges and geopolitical conflicts have made the recovery increasingly fragile,"" siad Jindal in his message. JSW Steel delivered its highest-ever Ebitdavof ₹39,007 crore and profit of ₹20,938 crore in FY22. Its net debt-to-Ebitda, on a consolidated basis, stands at a comfortable 1.45 times. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Jindal added that steel consumption will grow at a healthy rate and recent government measures such as the export duty on steel are only a short-term headwind for the industry. “The future of the Indian steel industry is exciting with a steadily expanding domestic market. During FY 2021-22, Indian steel consumption grew to 106 MnT from the prepandemic level of 100 MnT. Demand is expected to grow at a healthy rate through the current decade. We view the export duties imposed on steel in May 2022 as a shortterm headwind, since they have been imposed with the objective of controlling inflation. We continue to engage with the government on this matter and believe that the duties would be withdrawn once inflation moderates,"" said Jindal. India is a cost-competitive exporter of steel, and has an opportunity to take on a larger role in the global steel trade, added Jindal. “We are expanding our India capacity in a phased manner to 37 MTPA from 27 MTPA at present to tap the opportunities in the domestic as well as global markets,"" he said. JSW Steel is expanding its Vijayanagar plant from 12 MTPA to 19.5 MTPA, while Bhushan Power and Steel is being expanded to 5 MTPA. It recently finished a 5 MTPA expansion of its Dolvi facility. Jindal also highlighted the company’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions and other efforts on the ESG front. Last fiscal, JSW Steel raised $500 million through Sustainability linked bonds (SLB), the first such issuance by an Indian steel maker. “The US$500 million SLB has a tenure of 10.5 years and is linked to our CO2 reduction target. We have committed to reduce our CO2 emissions intensity (Scope 1 and 2) by 42% by 2030, compared to the base year of 2005, aligned with India’s Nationally Determined Contribution,"" said Jindal. He added that JSW Steel has earmarked ₹10,000 crore for investments to reduce its carbon emissions through various initiatives, such as increasing the use of renewable energy to replace thermal power, reduce fuel rate through improved raw material quality via beneficiation, and deployment of new technology."
Updated: 26 Jun 2022,"Bear days are numbered, build quality portfolio. These stocks are hot picks",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/bear-days-are-numbered-build-quality-portfolio-in-markets-these-stocks-are-hot-picks-11656263787991.html,"Markets recovered last week as equity benchmarks snapped a two-week losing streak as investors took a breather from inflation concerns due to the downside in commodity prices. Going forward, markets will continue to witness volatility as bearish stick still lingers with current macroeconomic risks, however, the days are numbered. The selling pressure is expected to be short-lived and experts have advised investors to build quality stocks portfolio. On Friday, Sensex finished at 52,727.98 up by 462.26 points or 0.88%. Nifty 50 closed at 15,699.25 higher by 142.60 points or 0.92%. Both the benchmarks have gained nearly 3% each from June 20 to 24. During these days, investors' wealth on BSE climbed by ₹7,40,977.89 crore. BSE market cap stood at ₹234,86,923.67 crore on June 20 and jumped to ₹242,27,901.56 crore on June 24. Research Analysts - Dharmesh Shah, Nitin Kunte, CMT, Pabitro Mukherjee, and Vinayak Parmar at ICICI Securities in their technical note said, equity benchmarks behaved contrary to our expectations as downbeat global cues tracking anxiety around rising inflation globally, rate hikes weighed on investor sentiments. On Nifty 50, they said the velocity of the decline accelerated on breach of March low of 15700 and drifted further to the 15200 mark. Going forward, the analysts said, ""We expect the index to gradually resolve higher and extend pullback towards the 16600 regions in coming months wherein strong support is placed in the vicinity of 14800-14600 zone, which we expect to hold as it is 80% retracement of CY-21 rally (13596-18604), at 14600. Thus, dips should be utilised to construct a portfolio by accumulating quality stocks in a staggered manner."" ICICI Securities analysts' positive bias is based on four factors: 1. The reading of the percentage of stocks above 200 DMA below 15 signifies extreme pessimism in the markets that eventually leads to a technical pullback to the tune of a minimum of 10% in the subsequent three months. 2. Index has already corrected 18% from the life highs and has approached oversold reading on the weekly momentum oscillator. The weekly RSI has approached its lowest level (placed at 35) since May 2020. Historically, a reading of 35 on weekly RSI has produced a decent pullback, and the analysts expect this rhythm to maintain in the coming months. 3. India continues to relatively outperform the EM basket even in the ongoing corrective phase despite significant selling by FIIs. Over the past one year, while the MSCI EM index has corrected over 40% from highs, India has relatively outperformed as the benchmark corrected only 18%. 4. The India VIX and crude oil prices have cooled off from the recent swing high. Indian Equities have an inverse correlation with the India VIX. Thus, providing impetus for the acceleration of ongoing pullback. They added, ""On the broader market front, in three instances over the past decade, intermediate correction in the Nifty Midcap, Small cap indices have been to the tune of 28% and 40%, respectively. At present, both indices have corrected 25% and 34%, respectively."" Therefore, the analysts said, ""any further correction is likely to be short-lived amid oversold territory and would set the stage for a technical pullback in coming weeks."" Here are the top picks of ICICI Securities analysts: BFSI - SBI, HDFC, Kotak Bank, Federal Bank, and Bajaj Finance. Telecom & Technology - Reliance, TCS, Infosys, L&T Infotech, HCL Technology, and Coforge. Capital goods - L&T, ABB, Siemens, BEL, AIA Engineering, ELGI Equipment, Sanghvi Movers, and Timken India. Consumption - Hindustan Unilever, Titan, ITC, Asian Paints, Tata Consumer, Havells India, Jubilant Foods, and Astral Poly. Auto - M&M, Maruti Suzuki, Ashok Leyland, Jamna Auto, Mahindra CIE, FIEM Industries, and Minda Industries. Infra and Realty - DLF LTD, Brigade Enterprise, and Phoenix Mills. Pharma & Chemicals - Divi's Laboratories, Cipla, Syngene, Torrent Pharma, and SRF Ltd. Metal - JSW Steel, Hindalco, and Graphite. Others - Adani Port, Indian Hotels, Zee Entertainment, Trent, Concor, Nocil, Balrampur Chinni, BDL, Bluedart, Dixon Technologies, Kansai Nerolac, and NRB Bearing. Markets weekly outlook: For the week June 27 to July 1, ICICI Direct analysts expect Nifty to eventually resolve past falling channel placed at 15800 and gradually head towards 16200 levels in coming weeks. In expiry week, use dips towards 15400 to create long positions as the index is poised at extreme oversold readings. ICICI Direct analysts added that brent oil prices have breached the weekly rising trend line indicating a loss of momentum and ""we expect upsides to be capped in 125-130 zone."" According to ICICI Direct analysts, amongst sectors preferences, IT, and BFSI are key sectors with favourable risk/reward, while Auto and Capital goods are expected to extend outperformance. The analysts prefer - SBI, HDFC, Kotak Bank, TCS, Maruti Suzuki, ITC, and Titan in large caps while in midcaps we like KPIT Technologies, Federal Bank, AIA Engineering, NRB Bearings, Ashok Leyland, Automotive Axles, Bharat Electronics, Havells, Trent, and Indian Hotel. Yesha Shah, Head of Equity Research, Samco Securities said, ""The coming week has a host of events arriving which could affect the mood of the market. Globally, investors will keenly analyze the US quarterly GDP growth rate numbers. The USA would officially enter into a recession if they post a negative growth and thus this could have a spill-over effect on global markets."" ""In India, the vehicle sales figures will continue to fuel stock-specific moves on D-Street as investors attempt to decipher the future trend,"" Shah added, ""Moreover, the monthly F&O expiry in the second half of the week may cause volatility in the indices. Investors are thus advised to accumulate good stocks with strong fundamentals, free cash flows, and lower leverage over the long run while disregarding short-term difficulties."""

Among individual metal stocks, SAIL, Jindal Steel, JSW Steel, and Tata Steel shares were trading with gains of over 3% each. Domestic brokerage and research firm ICICI Securities has maintained Reduce rating on metal stocks Tata Steel (TP: ₹827), SAIL (TP: ₹61), JSW Steel (TP: ₹448), NMDC (TP: ₹98), JSPL (TP: ₹290). APL Apollo remains its top stock pick in the metal sector and has maintained Buy tag whereas has maintained Hold on Jindal Stainless and Shyam Metalics shares. APL Apollo is one of the major beneficiaries of steel export duty. Sharp decline in steel prices is expected to dent EBITDA print in Q1FY23, through inventory losses and volume impact due to industry destocking,  What will impact Q2/Q3FY23 for APL is the continuous downtrend of HRC prices leading to periodic destocking impulses. This leads us to reduce our FY23/24E volume estimates for APL Apollo. We maintain BUY on the stock with a revised target price of ₹1,042/share,"" the note stated. It has maintained reduce on Hindalco, while downgrading Nalco to sell from Reduce. As per ICICI Securities, Hindalco is feeling the possible pinch of aluminium returning into surplus (from deficit) over FY23/24E, along with the traded instrument facing the headwinds of a rising interest rate environment and possible compression in Novelis margins.  “In China, fresh lockdowns have thwarted hopes of any recovery. Regional prices continue to slip with FOB prices in the range of USD700-750/t. The situation is further exacerbated by macro risks. We maintain our cautious stance on ferrous sector with Shyam Metalics (TP: ₹353 as the sole ‘BUY’ in the space,"" said another brokerage Edelweiss. Meanwhile, Edelweiss has a ‘HOLD’ rating on Tata Steel with target price of ₹985 and JSPL (TP: ₹385) and ‘REDUCE’ on JSW Steel (TP: ₹471) and SAIL (TP: ₹57).

Updated: 15 Jun 2022,JSW Steel is far from regaining its sheen,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/jsw-steel-is-far-from-regaining-its-sheen-11655271847770.html,"Shares of JSW Steel have declined by nearly 11% since the government levied export duty on steel effective 22 May. This along with dull international prices has resulted in the domestic price of this commodity correcting significantly. According to SteelMint, domestic hot-rolled coil prices plunged by 20% from the highs seen in April to ₹63,100 per tonne as on 8 June. “Management expects price declines to stabilize unless coking coal costs come down from present levels of around $400 per tonne,"" said analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) in a report on 13 June. The brokerage hosted JSW Steel at Nomura Investment Forum However, the imposition of export duty means lower realization on shipments. Even so, the company will continue to export 15-20% of its production in FY23 in order to maintain long-term customer relations. “Relatively lower realization on exports by 15% and with exports accounting for 15% of management’s sales estimates, overall net steel realization can be impacted by 2.0-2.5% for FY23F,"" added the Nomura report. But there is some respite from the softening of raw material costs such as coking coal and iron ore. However, this impact is expected to reflect in the financials with a lag. Thus, the company expects Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) per tonne to stabilize from Q2FY23. On the demand front, there could be a slowdown in construction activity due to the upcoming monsoon season which would weigh on steel demand. On the other hand, the demand from automobile sector continues to be firm with increased traction seen for passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles. In H1FY23, the company anticipates mill-level inventories to rise but the channel inventories to be softer in the near term due to subdued demand. As prices stabilize, it foresees buying to re-emerge from the later part of June. Meanwhile, it targets to achieve brownfield capacity expansion at $400 per tonne which is considerably below the $1000 per tonne replacement cost of steel plants globally. “We believe management focus on relatively low-cost brownfield expansion, digitalization and other cost measures will structurally boost profitability,"" added the Nomura report."
Updated: 10 Jun 2022,Why this newly listed metal stock is Edelweiss' only 'Buy' in the sector,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/metal-stocks-to-buy-why-shyam-metalics-is-the-only-buy-from-edelweiss-in-the-space-11654837948010.html,"Domestic steel mills are in a quandary, falling steel prices and high coking coal prices are keeping domestic spreads low while falling export realisation (with added impact of export duties) are clouding export potential, as per brokerage and researc firm Edelweiss.  That said, the brokerage house believes JSW Steel, Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL) and Shyam Metalics are likely to benefit from the steep fall in domestic steel prices while Tata Steel is expected to gain from relatively high coking coal proportion and contracts. The brokerage has maintained its cautious outlook on the ferrous space with ‘Reduce’ rating on JSW Steel (target price: ₹471) and Steel Authority of India (SAIL) with target price of ₹57, whereas it has ‘Hold’ on JSPL (TP: ₹385) and Tata Steel (TP: ₹985).  Meanwhile, Shyam Metalics has remained Edelweiss' sole ‘Buy’ in the ferrous space, benefitting from lower iron ore prices and nil export duty on ferroalloys (17% revenue), and has a target price of ₹353 on the metal stock. “Going ahead, while we await demand to pick up, we view the sharp spike in steel and aluminium exports cautiously. This suggests the government might go slow on reining in exports if demand stays subdued. We retain our cautious stance on the ferrous space with a ‘BUY’ only on Shyam Metalics,"" the note stated. The brokerage is particularly cautious on demand outlook as a renewed lockdown of one district in Shanghai has raised concerns that the full reopening of the financial centre could be delayed by a resurgence in cases. “We view China’s trade data as double-edged. On the one hand, increased copper and iron ore imports point to a possible revival in demand and, on the other, recordhigh Al exports and significantly high steel exports undermine the oft-stated policy of reining in exports in order to reduce carbon footprint,"" Edelweiss added. If Al/steel exports continue to remain at high level, in the event of weakness in domestic demand persisting, there might be that prices of these commodities coming under pressure.

India, South Asia's third-largest economy, raised export tax by 15% on eight steel intermediates and scrapped import duty on coking coal, shortages of which have been driving up steel prices. The export taxes on steel where part of a series of changes to taxes on crucial commodities aimed at reining in retail inflation, which has hit eight-year highs. The government also scrapped import duty on coking coal, a key steelmaking raw material, and raised export tariffs on iron ores and concentrates to 50% from 30%. After New Delhi's decision to slap the export tax, analysts had warned that the move would force steel companies to curtail overseas shipments. The increase in export taxes on iron ore, announced by the Indian government will lead to large surpluses at home, and mainly hit producers of low grade ores that depend on overseas markets, a mining industry body said. JSW Steel has earmarked ₹20,000 crore capital expenditure in the current fiscal and hoped that headwinds such as export duty on steel and high coking coal prices are likely to be short-lived. The leading steelmaker in the country does not expect any ""substantial easing"" of price of the metal in the domestic market from the current levels, unless the prices of coking coal, a key raw material for the steel manufacturing, moderate in the international market. Russia and Ukraine exported 46.7 million tonnes in 2020, mostly to the European Union, the world's second biggest importer of steel, according to the World Steel Association."

Updated: 30 May 2022,Steelmakers  are  in  a  sweet  spot despite headwinds: JSW’s Rao,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/steelmakers-are-in-a-sweet-spot-despite-headwinds-jsw-s-rao-11653851474147.html,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI : Despite the headwinds, including an export duty hike and rising cost of coking coal, a majority of Indian steel manufacturers are in a sweet spot, contrary to what analysts say, Seshagiri Rao M.V.S., joint managing director and group chief financial officer, JSW Steel Ltd, said in an interview. Rao shared his views on the international and domestic factors that will lead to a conducive demand scenario. Edited excerpts: Are the valuations of steel companies fair after the announcement of export duty hikes on steel? I don’t agree with analyst reports at all. They say the steel industry will now be downgraded and there will be a big problem for the sector following the imposition of export duty. The underlying themes that I have been talking about for the last two years are intact. The supercycle mentioned for the last two years is still there. Investments in renewable capacity creations will continue to drive demand. With the Russia-Ukraine war, every country is looking at increasing defence expenditure, which will raise demand. For one reason or other, steel demand continues to be robust. The themes have not changed, so I don’t subscribe to the views of the market or analysts to downgrade the sector. What is your view on the duration of the export duty hikes? The export duty hike is a temporary phenomenon and the government had put such a duty even in 2008 when inflation was high. However, the duty was only for a month on flat products and for five months on long products. Taking cues from the past, when inflation was high, generally, the government takes certain fiscal steps. In our view, those are very temporary and once inflation comes under control, those will go. What about domestic steel demand? Is it enough to offset the impact of export duty hikes? Will it in any way change your capex plans? It is important to understand our Q4 results. While Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margin has come down on a consolidated basis by ₹4,300 per tonne sequentially, our absolute Ebitda showed 1% growth. It was possible because of higher volumes. Costs are up 3%, blended realizations have come down by 3%, and Ebitda has gone up by 1% because volume growth was at 31%. That is the story. The story of JSW is about volume growth. We sold 16.35 million tonnes (mt) of steel last year. Of this, we exported 4.5 mt. The remaining was sold in the domestic market. This year, we plan to increase our sales by 3.5 mt. What factors will drive additional volumes and where is the demand coming from? The auto industry is seeing good demand, particularly in the PV (passenger vehicle) and MHCV (medium and heavy commercial vehicle) space, which is being led by infrastructure and mining. Second is solar and appliances. We saw very good growth last year and this year. Besides, the government is spending on infrastructure. The allocated capex of ₹7.50 trillion will be spent during this year. If we look at the drivers, we expect incremental demand of 8 mt. We will sell our products in domestic markets and also export. When export realizations were very attractive, we increased our exports to 25%. Even when export realizations had fallen, we exported 15%. Our exports varied between 15% and 25%, and we have never stopped exports in the last 30 years of JSW. Just because export duty has come, we will not stop exports. We will keep serving our customers because developing customers is not easy. Will you continue to remain Ebitda-positive on the export front? We do not look at whether we lose some amount of sales or make money. However, as far as overall volumes of sales is concerned, we will be able to meet the 24 mt guidance this year and we will continue to remain positive at the Ebitda level and at net profit levels. Is there a possibility of an agreement between India and Russia on coking coal supplies at a price beneficial for both, as has been the case in the oil and gas space? Basically, a rerouting of trade is happening. The trade that used to happen between Russia, Ukraine, Europe, and Japan, among others, is where sanctions have been imposed. Countries that have stopped buying from Russia are looking at supplies from Australia or Colombia or other places, and this rerouting and establishing logistics will take time. Russian coal is available to India and other countries that are willing to buy, but it has to be transported. Logistics need to be in place, and that is the problem. What is your capex outlay for the year and how are expansions progressing? We allocated capex of ₹15,000 crore last year. We have completed 5 mtpa expansions and we have created downstream projects. For FY23, we are spending ₹20,000 crore-18,000 crore for JSW Steel; ₹2,000 crore for Bhushan Steel and Power. From 26 mtpa at present, we are expanding our capacities by 9 mtpa."

The government’s imposition of export duty on steel has not gone down well with the investors. But JSW Steel’s management isn’t perturbed. In its March quarter earnings call on Friday, the management said that it expects this move by the government to be temporary akin to the trend observed in 2008. Even so, this would weigh on overall sales realization as exports are sizeable for the company. In FY22, exports contributed 28% to consolidated volumes.       "

The company hopes that the headwinds such as export duty on steel and high coking coal prices are likely to be short-lived. JSW Steel Joint Managing Director and Group CFO Seshagiri Rao told PTI in a telephonic interview said, ""The major headwinds are volatile coke price and export duty on steel. However, we expect these to be short-lived. There will be some moderation in exports but value-added steel exports will have less impact. Till now, we remain optimistic and the CAPEX plan of ₹20,000 crore in the current fiscal remains intact."" Notably, JSW Steel had earmarked a CAPEX of ₹15,000 crore in FY22 as part of its strategy to ramp up capacity. Also, last year, the company paid more than ₹19,000 crore to conclude the takeover of Bhushan Power and Steel. Rao said that amid high CAPEX plans, the company's debt level will not increase significantly from the current outstanding of ₹56,700 crore due to ""repayments from internal accruals"". Earlier this month, the government levied export duty on 11 iron and steel intermediates and trimmed import duty on three key raw materials for steel production and three inputs for making plastic items. The move to reduce import duty on some raw materials including coking coal and ferronickel is to lower the cost for the domestic industry and bring down the prices. Also, the Centre raised the duty on exports of iron ore up to 50%, while the duty on a few steel intermediaries was hiked to 15%. This has been done to increase domestic availability. According to Rao, if such orders continue for long, there will be under-utilization of the 150 million tonne capacity in the industry as it was built not only for domestic demand and import substitution but also for exports. He said, ""At least 11-12 percent of the industry capacity is built targeting export markets. And in the current fiscal, we have the potential to double this. Hence, if the export duty continues for a longer period then it may have its consequences on aggressive expansion plans of steelmakers,"" In the financial year FY22, steel exports stood at 18.37 million tonnes. JSW Steel aims to increase its capacity to 37.5 million tonnes by FY25 and 45 million tonnes by 2030. At present, the company's capacity is around 21.47 million tonnes. In FY22, on a consolidated basis, JSW Steel posted the highest ever quarterly crude steel production to 5.81 million tonnes, up by 11 % QoQ and 38% YoY. While saleable steel sales stood highest ever as well to 5.99 million tonnes increasing by 29% QoQ and 47% YoY. For FY23, JSW Steel expects total combined volumes of crude steel at 25 million tonnes, while sales are forecasted at 24 million tonnes."

Consolidated revenue from operations touched ₹46,895 crore, up 23% sequentially and 74% year-on-year. The US loss followed an arbitration order on the subsidiary’s dispute with lessors of a coking coal mining lease and plant lease, and consequent termination of lease. The impact of costlier coal and iron ore was visible on the company’s operating performance. Operating Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) was ₹9,184 crores, up 1% sequentially and 9% year-on-year. The strong volume growth helped support profits, even as blended steel realizations declined sequentially, while coking coal costs rose. Steel sales for the quarter stood at 5.99 million tonnes, up 47% year-on-year. Standalone operations contributed well, with steel sales for the quarter at 5.11 million tonnes, an increase of 26% year-on-year. Crude steel production of 5.01 million tonnes was 20% higher year-on-year, which the company attributed to higher capacity utilization of 98% at the existing facilities and additional production of 0.59 million tonnes from Dolvi Phase-II expansions during the quarter. The board of directors of JSW Steel, Creixent Special Steels Ltd (CSSL) and JSW Ispat Special Products Ltd (JISPL) have approved a scheme of arrangement for the amalgamation of JISPL and CSSL into JSW Steel.

CSSL is a joint venture between JSW Steel Ltd and AION Investments Pvt. II Ltd and is in the business of trading in steel and steel products and holding investments Seshagiri Rao M.V.S, joint managing director & group CFO of JSW Steel said, “The amalgamation will not only increase efficiencies and enhance administrative control but will also create and enhance stakeholders’ value by unlocking the intrinsic value and growth potential for the respective businesses of JISPL, CSSL and JSW Steel. When we acquired Monnet Ispat & Energy as a distressed entity in 2018 with AION as our partner, our aim was to turn the company around and metamorphosize it into a sustainable business on its own before merging it with JSW Steel."" During the quarter, JSW Steel saw its net debt reduced by ₹9,662 crore. Consolidated net gearing (net debt to equity) stood at 0.83x versus 1.02x at the end of 3Q FY2022 and net debt to Ebitda stood at 1.45x versus. 1.73x at the end of 3Q FY2022. The company’s 5mtpa brownfield expansion at Vijayanagar is expected to be completed by FY24.

In its audit report, JSW Steel said that during the fourth quarter of FY 2021-22, the global economy witnessed significant volatility arising out of the geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine and continued supply chain disruptions. Even though India's trade and economic activity strengthened following the steady fall in Covid cases and normalization of activity, inflation accelerated in line with global trends, exacerbated by the sharp rise in energy prices. Further, JSW Steel added that the domestic steel industry continued to see steady demand from the government's continued focus on public infrastructure. Investments in the construction and infrastructure sector continued to support steel consumption. Hence the steel industry witnessed an increase in finished steel consumption by 7 .2% in Q4 FY 2021-22 over the previous quarter. JSW Steel highlighted that on the back of this strong demand environment, the Company delivered a strong set of numbers, achieving an average capacity utilization of 98% for the quarter vs 94% in Q3 FY 2021-22 from the existing standalone operations and further supplemented by ramp up of the Dolvi phase-II expansion.

Updated: 23 May 2022,Misguided barriers,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/misguided-barriers-11653325880881.html,"Reverberations of the government’s policy tweaks made on Saturday to help rein in rising inflation were felt on Monday in Indian stock markets, with steel scrips dropping sharply as they reacted to export duties upped on iron ore and imposed on a range of steel inputs. Tata Steel, Steel Authority of India and JSW Steel saw their shares slide. A global upswing in the prices of ferrous commodities had boosted the export earnings of these firms, but analysts see their overseas market prospects hit hard by the Centre’s action. The aim of discouraging exports was to keep domestic supplies up and prices down. The worry, however, is that little will be achieved on inflation, as specific causes of the phenomenon are hard to isolate at this late stage, even as it shows a lack of policy stability, distorts markets and disrupts the profit-maximizing plans of private businesses. It amounts to a market intervention of the kind top executives were familiar with in the era before liberalization when profits were subject to sudden shifts in operating conditions effected by policymakers. Inflation is for our central bank to tame. Sure, the Centre must also do its bit to help. But item-specific micromanagement is best avoided."

Tata Steel Ltd, JSW steel Ltd, SAIL, Jindal Steel and Power Ltd fell over 10%, with hitting 52-week lows in opening deals on Monday. The government on Saturday waived customs duty on the import of some raw materials, including coking coal and ferronickel, used by the steel industry, a move which will lower the cost for the domestic industry and reduce prices. Also, to increase domestic availability, the duty on exports of iron ore was hiked up to 50%, and a few steel intermediaries to 15%, according to a notification. This move is likely to divert more steel toward the domestic market and control the sharp upward spiral in steel prices, said analysts  Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities Ltd said, “The government’s decision to impose a 15% export duty on steel should lead to a significant correction in domestic steel prices (8-10%) given India’s dependence on exports"". This would impact the profitability and earnings of the Indian Steel manufacturers. This comes at a time when input cost of steel companies have risen sharply with rising coal and iron-ore prices, and could impact profitability and in some cases capital expenditure plans as well. Analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said, “We believe the measure would have produced the desired result if implemented a year ago when the steel prices were at a similar level but coal was about 20% lower and profitability was at a near peak. The industry would have the capacity to absorb the impact without sacrificing its capex plans, which is not possible now."" Domestic steel prices have risen sharply in the last two years and the Russia-Ukraine crisis meant hit unsustainable levels of ₹75,000-80,000 per tonne in early April.  As a result, there was some correction in prices. Hot-rolled coil prices were on a par with landed cost of imports at ₹69,000/tonne, or around $890, said Kamlesh Bagmar Deputy - Head of Research - Institutional Equities Prabhudas Lilladher. Export realisations for steel manufacturers stood at close to $900 a tonne. The 15% export duty, would translate to an additional cost of $135/tonne on volumes, said Bagmar. The global steel market was spooked following the Russia-Ukraine war, depressed market conditions in China and high inflation. Imposition of export duty by India could destabilise already weak demand in anticipation of lower supplies from Indian mills, added Bagmar."

Calling export duty on steel as big negative for the sector, CLSA report says, “In a bid to curb inflation the Ministry of Finance announced export duties on most steel products, along with an excise duty cut for petrol and diesel. This is likely to divert more supply towards the domestic market. With prices now being guided by the export parity philosophy (instead of import parity) it could lead to a sharp correction in steel prices in India.

However, CLSA report maintained that the decision augurs well for cement and consumer durables. Explaining the reason for sharp fall in steel stocks today, ICICI Security report says, ""The Indian government has imposed export duties on steel, steelmaking raw materials and intermediaries to preserve higher domestic supplies and control rising prices. Most of the exports of steel/stainless steel will attract 15% export duty now (from nil earlier).

In FY22/FY21, the trade surplus stood at USD10.3b/USD3.8b. India’s import dependence on ‘iron and steel’ has come off over the years and stands at only 2.1% of total imports in FY22 from 2.8-3.6% over FY06-16.

This will ease up the steel prices, which will be beneficial to industries like infrastructure and real estate. However, steelmakers are not happy with the move as their current expansion plans were based on the assumptions of growth in global as well as domestic markets. The 15% export duty on the flat steel will make Indian steel prices less competitive globally and most of the steel producers are not sure whether the domestic market will absorb the extra production. All these factors will force the steelmakers to evaluate their future plans.""

IT majors like TCS, Wipro, Infosys and HCL Tech shares have given zero return in 2022. In YTD time, TCS share price has dipped from ₹3815 to ₹3615 apiece levels, logging over 5 per cent loss in this time. In 2022, Wipro share price has crashed around 25 per cent, Infosys share price has tumbled around 16 per cent whereas HCL Tech shares nosedived near 17 per cent. According to stock market experts, barring few IT stocks, most of the IT shares are expected to continue underperforming in short to medium term. They said that IT companies are expected to feel the heat of lower margin and higher attrition in short to medium term. Speaking on the reasons for underperformance by IT stocks in 2022; Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart Ltd said, ""IT stocks have started underperforming due to factors like employee attrition, global headwinds, margin deterioration due to increased cost, reduced pricing power, and higher valuations compared to the broader index. We believe that the underperformance will continue in the short to medium term."" Santosh Meena said that IT stocks are currently at much higher PE multiple of their last 5 year average PE. So, long term investors can accumulate quality IT stocks on every big dip and hold the stock for long term for whopping return. However, for short to medium term investors, he advised them to look at other options like commodities, infrastructure, capital goods sector and banking. Highlighting at higher valuations of the IT stocks; Siddhartha Bhaiya, MD and Fund Manager at Aequitas Investment Consultancy said, ""In the IT sector, the demand will remain strong, but there will be margin pressures given the never seen before attrition levels in the IT sector. There has been a complete reset as far as the wage levels are concerned in the IT sector. The IT stocks were available at 10 to 12 times earnings in 2016. Today, they are quoted much above their PE levels than they are quoted historically. We are neutral about the IT sector.""

A group of officials headed by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba is meeting on Saturday to pick the winning bid, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private. A final announcement will be made after the approval by a ministerial panel which is largely procedural, they said. The asset sale plan will help bridge the budget gap and meet spending targets as the economy faces fresh headwinds from the geopolitical tensions. The government is targeting to garner 650 billions rupees ($8.5 billion) from disinvestment, including sale of minority stake in some companies, in the year to March 2023. Loss-making Pawan Hans provides air transport services for exploration activities of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. The federal government has 51% stake in Pawan Hans, while ONGC holds 49%.

Updated: 19 Apr 2022,Steel giant JSW Group plans to switch majority of its bonds to green instruments,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/steel-giant-jsw-group-plans-to-switch-majority-of-its-bonds-to-green-instruments-11650334040429.html,"India’s JSW Group, which runs emissions-heavy businesses including steel, cement and energy, plans to switch a majority of its bonds to green instruments as the industrial giant seeks access to longer-term borrowings.  Raising debt overseas through green and sustainability-linked bond issues will allow the group led by tycoon Sajjan Jindal to almost double its tenure to 10 years, as longer term financing is increasingly difficult for companies raising funds in India, Group Chief Financial Officer Seshagiri Rao said in an interview. There is a “high-probability"" the company will switch only to selling sustainability-linked bonds or green bonds over the next five years, he said. Green bonds are instruments used to raise money for environmentally friendly projects. SLBs, on the other hand, may be used more broadly, but are linked to sustainability targets such as carbon reduction. In India, companies including JSW more often issue these bonds overseas as the local market isn’t as mature. India's bond sales with green or sustainability labels totaled about $6.9 billion in 2021 from $875 million the prior year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Companies across the world are increasingly raising sustainable debt through instruments linked to their environmental goals as pressure intensifies from investors and regulators. In the metals and mining sector, billionaire Andrew Forrest’s iron ore giant Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. raised money through a green bond earlier this month.  For JSW, which has at least $2.15 billion of international bonds coming due by 2027, tapping the overseas market would be crucial as Indian lenders are wary of longer-term loans to the infrastructure sector following a lingering credit slowdown, made worse by a crisis in the shadow banking industry some years back.  The group — with an annual revenue of $13 billion — raises a third of its funds through bonds and the rest through export credit agencies and external commercial borrowings, Rao said. “More and more investors, banks and the entire financial system will look to investing only in those companies which are ESG-compliant and those firms which have a roadmap on how they will reduce emissions,"" Rao said from his office in Mumbai. “Otherwise raising financing itself will become difficult in the future. So the company has to evolve in that direction."" The group has raised about $1.6 billion via SLBs and green bonds. Last year, flagship JSW Steel Ltd. raised a $500 million SLB that was linked to its ability to trim emissions from three mills in India by about 23% to around 1.95 tons of carbon dioxide per ton of crude steel produced by the end of the decade. The target took into account emissions from the company’s own production — scope 1 —  and energy usage —  scope 2. JSW will have to pay a one-time coupon step-up of 37.5 basis points if it fails to meet the commitments. The group has outlined plans to spend $1 billion to cut emissions at its steel mills and 750 billion rupees ($9.8 billion) to shift its power business, JSW Energy Ltd., away from coal to renewable sources.  While changes at industries like the group’s steel and cement operations — traditionally among the biggest polluters — are being made in the backdrop of India’s own national target to turn carbon neutral by 2070, a large part of the push is being driven by overseas investors and customers.  For JSW Steel, which sells about a quarter of its total exports to Europe, the region’s plans to impose a border tax on carbon-intensive imports such as steel and aluminum is adding momentum to its plans to cut emissions, Rao said. The mill is automating its processes to measure real-time carbon emissions against the monthly data it currently collects, in preparation for the new rule before it ships products out to Europe, Rao said. The steel unit has cut overall emissions by almost 27% since 2005, he said. “Right now the entire strategy is to continue to expand and ensure that the carbon emissions are comparable with the rest of the world in terms of the blast furnace process of steel-making,"" Rao said.

After successful public hearings, the Ministry of Environment & Forest and Climate Change accorded clearance to the project, touted as one of the largest in the manufacturing sector in the country.  JSW Utkal Steel is part of the $13 billion JSW Group, The capital expenditure for the integrated steel plant project is expected to be about ₹65,000 crores including associated facilities. The phase-wise work for the project will start once the land is handed over to the company by the government of Odisha, the company said. The mega project will generate huge employment opportunities in the region, which in turn will boost the economy of Odisha, a statement from JSW Steel said. JSW Steel has been incorporating sustainability into its core operations and decision-making practices, along with adopting the best available technologies to improve climate impact performance. It has adopted a specific climate change policy and set an ambitious CO2 emission reduction target of 42% over the base year of 2005 by 2030. JSW Steel is also investing in R&D for sustainable products and emission control, resource optimization, process efficiency and for ensuring multi-pronged digital focus to improve existing practices. It has issued the global steel industry’s first sustainability-linked US dollar bond in 2021, linked to its decarbonization target for 2030."

Companies from the Indian units of Unilever Plc and Suzuki Motor Corp. to homegrown JSW Steel Ltd. are raising prices in response to the global supply squeeze made worse by the surge in energy costs following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Higher retail fuel prices are also threatening to hurt demand just as the economy returned to its first full-year of growth after the pandemic-induced 6.6% contraction in the fiscal year ended March 2021. “Inflation remains unabated and is a cause of concern for the second year in a row,"" said Ankush Jain, chief financial officer at Dabur India Ltd., one of the nation’s largest consumer-goods companies. As pressure on margins loom, Dabur plans to go for calibrated price increases, besides rolling out cost optimization measures to mitigate price pressures, he said. Companies passing on costs will add to inflationary pressures, but the consumer price-targeting RBI has maintained that the current spike is supply driven and best dealt with by the government. Policy makers, who will meet this week to decide on interest rates, have signaled they may revise their 4.5% inflation forecast for fiscal 2023 but do little else to tighten settings for fear of hurting growth momentum. “While not acknowledged by the central bank yet, there is telltale evidence of inflation likely being much higher,"" said Kunal Kundu, an economist with Societe Generale GSC Pvt. That “can further imperil consumer confidence."" Consumers are key to the country’s economic recovery, with private consumption accounting for some 60% of India’s gross domestic product. To foster demand, the central bank will likely keep borrowing costs lower for longer. That will leave the RBI struggling to deliver on its primary job of keeping inflation at the 4% midpoint of its 2%-6% target band, given it is looking for support from the government in the form of fiscal measures. Inflation may turn out to be a bigger risk for India than growth over the coming quarters, if not dealt with at this stage using various monetary policy tools, according to Deutsche Bank AG economist Kaushik Das. He sees inflation staying near the RBI’s upper tolerance limit if there are further shocks such as an erratic monsoon, which could disrupt farm output that accounts for a fifth of the $2.7 trillion economy. Manufacturing companies’ expenditure on raw material increased 37% in the three months to December from a year ago, accounting for more than 63% of their total expenditure, an analysis from the central bank showed recently. “We see our profitability come under stress,"" said Shashank Srivastava, senior executive director for marketing and sales at Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., the nation’s largest car-maker. “We are watching the situation and not ruling out further prices hikes.""

Updated: 25 Mar 2022,"Drug, metal cos gain from supply disruption amid Ukraine  crisis",https://www.livemint.com/market/commodities/drug-metal-cos-gain-from-supply-disruption-amid-ukraine-crisis-11648147232325.html,"MUMBAI : The war in Ukraine has meant a rough ride for most Indian companies. But some are weathering the stormy markets relatively well with steel, aluminium, sugar and drug makers emerging as surprise winners. Indian steelmakers, which have seen steady demand from western Europe, are benefiting from rising prices of the commodity. Aluminium makers are also gaining from the disruption in supplies from Russia and Ukraine. Pharma companies are also expected to see a surge in sales in Russia as Western companies exit the sanctions-hit nation. In addition, rising crude prices have shifted focus to ethanol, benefiting Indian sugar producers, analysts and fund managers said. Metals are an obvious beneficiary from rising prices due to the conflict, while energy explorers and refiners will also benefit, said Nishit Master, portfolio manager, Axis Securities. Master said the increasing use of ethanol, which is blended with auto fuels to reduce crude imports, would also benefit sugar producers. The government’s ethanol blending programme is already helping sugar companies tide over a glut. Ethanol is made by fermenting sugar. Vikram Kasat, head of advisory at Prabhudas Lilladher, said he’s bullish on the sugar sector. The surge in crude prices has led Brazil to focus on ethanol production, and the world sugar demand is flowing to India at a time ethanol blending programme in India is also progressing well, Kasat said. Kasat also likes aluminium companies as Russia contributes 12% to global trade, and the sanctions on the country have squeezed supplies. The aluminium prices thereby might remain elevated. Jatin Damania, vice-president of fundamental research at Kotak Securities, estimates a deficit of 1.8-1.9 million tonnes in 2022/23 versus earlier estimates of 1.3-1.5 million tonnes. He favours aluminium makers Hindalco and Nalco. Meanwhile, Master also likes pharma companies with a presence in the speciality chemicals space. Pharma companies such as Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Glenmark Pharma and JB Chemicals have a sizable presence in Russia and other CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) countries. Dr Reddy’s reported revenues of ₹470 crore from Russia in the December quarter. This was more than a tenth of the company’s global generic sales. Dr Reddy’s can see major gains accrue because of the exit of Western companies, increasing its growth opportunities, too. “With the potential curtailment of business of its competitors (either voluntarily or through sanctions), Dr Reddy’s can increase its market share and raise prices, if required, to mitigate the currency devaluation risks post the hedging period,"" said analysts at Credit Suisse in their report dated 22 March. “As of now, the company is not facing any challenges in dispatching manufactured products to Russia and realizing receivables for the same,"" they added. While Dr Reddy’s is the key beneficiary, Lupin Cipla, Sun Pharma, Glenmark and JB Chemicals, which supply to Russia, will also benefit, an analyst at a domestic brokerage said, requesting anonymity. Meanwhile, Indian steelmakers continue to benefit from reduced supplies from Russia-Ukraine, which account for 10% of global steel exports. Mitul Shah, head of research at Reliance Securities, said that India accounted for 12% of European steel imports in 2021 and could gain market share in the region. Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Jindal Steel and Power are among companies that could be significant beneficiaries. Further, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, global defence expenditure is also set to rise significantly, said Shah. As a result, he expects defence sector companies, including Larsen and Toubro, and Bharat Electronics, to do well."

Russia’s ongoing military action in Ukraine threatens to have implications for non-ferrous metals and energy prices, highlighted brokerage house Edelweiss. In its view, the ongoing conflict has the potential to aid prices/volumes. The brokerage continues to prefer Hindalco with target price of ₹650 and JSPL with a target price of ₹637 and has ‘Buy’ ratings on the two metal stocks. “In the case of domestic players, we see a positive impact as Russia has emerged as the regional steel price setter in southeast Asia. If Russian exports are curtailed, coupled with the ongoing maintenance activities at Far East Mills and China focusing on reducing steel exports, we are likely to see Indian steel mills such as JSW Steel and Tata Steel gaining in the export market,"" the note stated. Further, uptick in LME Al prices will aid Hindalco the most, as its integration would limit the cost increase and Jindal Stainless will likely gain from higher Nickel prices, the brokerage added. “Hindalco and Vedanta are likely to gain from higher LME prices, Flat steel players such as JSW Steel and Tata Steel are likely to gain from higher export volumes and prices, in the absence of low cost Russian players; Jindal Stainless is likely to gain from higher Nickel prices, as it gets reflected in global stainless steel prices,"" the note added.

Tata Steel Ltd posted a consolidated net profit of ₹9,589.16 crore, up 139% for the quarter ending 31 December 2021. JSW Steel Ltd saw its consolidated profit jump 69% to ₹4,516 crore. Jindal Steel and Power Ltd’s (JSPL’s) net profit dropped 27.2% to ₹1,866.08 crore on higher expenses. Strong demand from the infrastructure and automobile sectors has brought steel consumption back to pre-covid levels, according to analysts. Steel companies have used the bull run to deleverage their balance sheets over the last two years. “India’s steel demand has begun to improve on the back of continued economic recovery as the third wave of covid begins to ebb. Our steel deliveries in India expanded by 4% in the first nine months of the financial year along with an improvement in product mix,"" Tata Steel chief executive officer and managing director T.V. Narendran said in the company’s earnings statement. India’s crude steel production improved 0.9% year-on-year (y-o-y) and 6% month-on-month (m-o-m) to 10.4 million tonnes (MT) in December 2021, according to India Ratings (Ind-Ra). During 2021, India’s crude steel output was 118.1 MT, up 17.8% y-o-y. Global crude steel production was 158.7 MT in December 2021, 10.8% higher m-o-m but 3% lower y-o-y. Chinese crude steel production was 86.2 MT in December 2021, 24% higher m-o-m, but 6.8% lower y-o-y. In 2022, Chinese production is likely to decrease, with the government focus of regulating steel output to reduce the environmental impact. The infrastructure, construction, auto, real estate and pipes sectors together account for around 65% of domestic demand. Domestic finished steel consumption in the fourth quarter of FY22 is likely to be sequentially higher with steel players typically picking up on execution and business after the monsoon season, which had partially impacted business over the third quarter, according to Ind-Ra. “The demand pipeline is robust. Also, with the budget announcements the infrastructure sector will get a push, boosting demand for steel,"" said V.R. Sharma, managing director, JSPL. In the budget, the government outlined improved spending on the infrastructure sector, which the industry believes will give a further boost to demand for the alloy. Besides an outlay of ₹7.5 trillion for FY23, total allocation for the highways sector has been increased to ₹1.99 trillion from ₹1.18 trillion in FY22. Industry officials, however, think that current steel prices are high and industries and customers are awaiting a price decline. The prices in Q4FY22 are expected to be range bound because of support from domestic demand and higher coking coal prices and will be partially countered by the surge in Omicron. Domestic hot rolled coil (HRC) prices were ₹63,600 per MT in mid-January 2022, down 1% on month and 15% on year. Domestic HRC prices were high in November 2021, it has faced some pressure due to a weaker domestic demand with the Omicron surge and a continual decline in global HRC prices due to a sluggish Chinese demand."

The highest bid of ₹12,100 crore by Tata Steel Long Products Ltd is accepted,"" Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary of the department of investment and public asset management (DIPAM) said in a statement. The financial bids from qualified bidders, including consortium of Jindal Steel & Power Limited and Nalwa Steel and Power Ltd, JSW Steel Limited and Tata Steel Long Products Limited (TSLP), were considered before arriving at the winning bidder. “Letter of Intent (LoI) is being issued to TSLP inviting them to sign the SPA.

Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd is a joint venture of four CPSEs - MMTC, NMDC, BHEL, MECON and two-state PSEs - OMC and IPICOL – which has an integrated steel plant with a capacity of 1.1 MT, at Kalinganagar, Odisha. The company has been running in huge losses and the plant is closed since March 2020, having debt and liabilities exceeding ₹6,600 crores as of March 2021, including huge overdue of promoters at ₹4,116 crore, banks at ₹1,741 crore, other creditors and employees. The company has a negative net worth of ₹3,487 crore and accumulated losses of ₹4,228 crore as of March 2021. The ministry added that this is the first instance of privatization of a public sector steel manufacturing enterprise in India, terming the success of the transaction as a win-win situation for all. “The biggest advantage of privatization will be to the local economy of the region as the strategic buyer will be able to revive a closed plant, bring in modern technology, best managerial practices and make an infusion of fresh capital, which will help in augmenting the capacity of the plant,"" the ministry added. Keeping in view the best interest of the serving employees, it was decided to keep the employees’ dues as the topmost ranking liability in the Waterfall Agreement to be satisfied first before any other liability. The transaction is on a “going concern"" basis and the employees of NINL will continue to be the employees of the company in terms of the Share Purchase Agreement (SPA), which binds the buyer to have a lock-in period of one year. The strategic buyer will also be bound to follow the terms of VRS applicable to CPSEs whenever such a decision is taken. Post-sale consideration will go towards settling the liabilities of the company, in the order provided in Waterfall Agreement.

Updated: 24 Jan 2022,JSW Steel's Q3 show marred by cost pressures,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/jsw-steel-s-q3-show-marred-by-cost-pressures-11643005642262.html,"JSW Steel's relatively soft performance in the December ended quarter (Q3) compared to previous quarters meant that shares fell more than 4% on Monday. Rising cost pressures and subdued domestic steel realisations had an impact on Q3 earnings. Crude steel production was at 4.41 million tonne in Q3, up 8% sequentially, while average capacity utilisation stood at 94%, with some production coming in from the recently commissioned Dolvi Phase-2 expansion. Helped by rising production, total sales at 4 million tonne grew 6% sequentially. However, declining steel realisations capped the rise in standalone revenue from operations to just 3% sequentially. Standalone realisations were down 2% quarter-on-quarter at ₹71,058 per tonne, as per analysts at Elara Securities (India) Pvt Ltd. Rising coal and power prices, on the other hand, pushed up input cost inflation, and as a result operating costs surged 8% sequentially weighing on the company's operating performance. Operating profit at ₹6,797 crore fell 22% sequentially. Per tonne Ebitda also contracted 26% sequentially to ₹16,993, as per analysts’ calculations. Not surprising then that standalone net profit of ₹3,424 crore was down 36.4% sequentially. Cost pressure is likely to continue into Q4 as well, with volatility in coal prices, adding to investor concerns. “We expect margins to remain under pressure in the near term with a sharp increase in coking coal costs and bottoming out of domestic iron ore prices amid strong global iron ore prices,"" said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. To take care of cost pressures, the price hikes by the company will be monitored. Of curse, there is a possibility is that higher coal prices, if sustained, will lead to steel prices being raised by all manufacturers. However, for now, domestic and imported prices are largely at similar levels. Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd in their note said Indian HRC steel price is down 8% from December quarterly average and broadly in-line with landed imports. Spot coking coal, on the other hand, is 20% above the December quarterly average. They, therefore, expect a compression in JSW's standalone Ebitda per tonne, going ahead. Rising volumes led by capacity expansions will provide some solace. The 5 million tonne expansion at Dolvi is already stabilising while another 5 million tonne per annum brownfield expansion at Vijayanagar is progressing well. Downstream expansion projects at Vijayanagar, Vasind, and Tarapur, too, are in advanced stages of implementation."

Although easing policy could lift Chinese demand, it still finds risk-reward much inferior to a year ago. “After a year-long rally, global steel and aluminum prices have softened on weak macro and demand concerns in China. China PMI is bottoming and policy could ease, but there is still risk of muted Chinese growth given the significance of property sector to metal demand. The backdrop for metals is better than the last decade as decarbonization in China should limit exports,"" the note stated. The brokerage believes that Chinese demand is structurally shifting from urbanization and industrial development to new economy infra such as renewables and EVs. This should drive a shift from steel and coal to copper, aluminum and other 'energy transition' metals.  Jefferies has downgraded Tata Steel (target price: ₹1,240) from Buy to Hold as it believes stock is unlikely to perform until earning visibility improves. It has also downgraded JSW Steel (target price: ₹600) from Buy to Underperform.  Though, it likes Novelis' downstream business, and prefers aluminum to steel, thus retains its Buy rating on Hindalco (target price: ₹660). It has retained Hold recommendation on Coal India (target price: ₹160). “FY23 cash flows for Tata Steel/Hindalco should remain strong driving further deleveraging; ROEs should also be above the respective FY11-20 averages. Stocks, however, have high correlation to consensus earnings trajectory, and we believe steel earnings cycle is inflecting down,"" it added. Analysts at Jeffries find Novelis also well-placed for the global shift to aluminum from steel in autos, and from plastics & glass in beverage cans. For 2022, they are most bullish on copper and aluminum. The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint."

Dhoot has bought the 3400 sq ft property in the ‘33 South’ housing complex from Peddar Realty Pvt Ltd and JSW Steel, subsidiaries of JSW Group, showed documents accessed through Zapkey.com that aggregates publicly available property registration data. The upscale project is a joint development between JSW Group and Mumbai-based developer Sameer Bhojwani. The transaction is among the most expensive residential property deals in the country. The sale deed was registered on 8 December and has attracted a stamp duty of ₹2.08 crore. Dhoot’s duplex apartment with a sea view is on the first and second floors of the 33 South tower. She will also get access to seven car parks. Dhoot, who is married to Anirudh Dhoot, a director in Videocon, didn’t respond to an email query and text messages. The ’33 South’ condominium has seen a string of high-profile sale transactions in recent months. In December itself, JSW Energy CEO Prashant Jain bought a duplex apartment in the high-rise building for ₹45 crore, or more than ₹1.32 lakh per sq ft. The Motilal Oswal family trust recently bought two duplex apartments spread across 6,800 sq ft on the 13th and 17th floors of the same building for ₹101 crore.

The company’s flat steel production was up 4% year-on-year while long products saw a strong 13% growth. These numbers exclude trial production from Phase II expansion of Dolvi works for part of the month of November’21. Including the same, the growth would have been much stronger. It is the expansions that are likely to drive growth for the company as we move forward. The integrated operations of the Dolvi 5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) brownfield expansion had already commenced. The same has taken the company's capacity to 23 mtpa. The JSW Group capacities in India & USA (including capacities under joint control) have grown to 28 MTPA. Meanwhile, the ongoing expansions will aid growth for the company further. The company’s 5 mtpa brownfield expansion at Vijayanagar is progressing well, with civil works underway at the site. The Downstream expansion projects at Vijayanagar, Vasind and Tarapur are in advanced stages of implementation. Overall, the same will add 7.5mtpa to the company's capacities by FY24. The demand environment that remains slightly sluggish currently, is expected to catch pace in the fourth quarter. The Indian Steel Association (ISA) expects Indian steel demand to grow by about 6.7 % during 2022. This should help support volumes and realisations too. The steel realisations after improving regularly for more than a year, however, had seen some correction too during the ongoing quarter.  As per Nomura Research, the JSW steel had cut HRC (hot-rolled coil) and CRC (cold-rolled coil) prices by ₹2,500/tonne to ₹68,000/tonne and ₹75,000/tonne, respectively, for early December-21 deliveries. The channel inventory level had remained relatively elevated and weak demand led the company to cut prices. The price correction recently has also led to concerns on margins.  However, on the positive side, the raw material prices too are cooling down. The moderation in input costs should be supported by the country’s largest iron-ore producers NMDC Ltd cutting iron-ore lumps and fines prices by ₹870/tonne and Rs200/tonne, respectively, for December’21.  The international coking coal prices that had seen sharp surge are also slowly moderating and were down 9% month-on-month to $385/tonne for November-21 as per Nomura Research data dated 3rd December, which also suggested that current price were further lower at $316/tonne, owing to falls in the last two weeks. The moderating input costs, rising volumes should aid earnings as a weak demand environment leads to some correction in realisations. say, analysts. The stock prices that have corrected more than 10% since August are factoring large part of concerns on tepid demand and steel price corrections during Q3."

""We believe the pent-up demand would get diluted in manufacturing while it will elongate for services progressively. Job creation is the clue in the medium term if consumption is to be kept ticking.

Updated: 25 Oct 2021,‘Indian steel cos can fill the gap being vacated by China’,https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/indian-steel-cos-can-fill-the-gap-being-vacated-by-china-11635103288009.html,"MUMBAI : JSW Steel Ltd, the flagship business of the diversified JSW Group, posted its highest quarterly profit of ₹7,179 crore in the second quarter, up 350% from a year earlier. However, the impact of rising input costs was visible in its operating performance. Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and group chief financial officer, JSW Steel, elaborated on his company’s plans to counter the increase in input costs. Edited excerpts from an interview:   Energy commodity prices have been going up. How is your company addressing this? This is an exceptional situation where coking coal prices have gone up 300% from $120 per tonne to $400 per tonne in a short span of time; every day, the prices are moving up by $10-20 per tonne, which is very high volatility in prices. So, we are seeing what is the prevalent mechanism globally to deal with such volatility. In the US, for instance, steel prices are linked to scrap prices. Scrap prices go up and steel prices go up and vice versa. Recently, we have observed that in the European market, when energy prices are going up, one of the major steel companies introduced energy surcharge of €50 per tonne. Though this concept is not there in India, we are seriously contemplating on introducing an energy surcharge linked to the base price of coking coal. If the coking coal price goes up, the surcharge will increase; if it goes down, it will decrease. Of course, this is subject to customers accepting it. We have to consult our original equipment manufacturing customers and take their views before we implement it. Any other measures that you are taking to mitigate costs? Yes. One is that we have completed our Dolvi plant expansion. This will help increase volumes. When the expansion is operational fully, the cost will be much lower. Because the existing operations are all gas-based whereas the new facility is not gas-based, cost will be lower by 15-20%, so the benefit of lower cost will also come in. Also, our overseas operations have started doing well. It contributed ₹485 crore in the second quarter to our earnings against ₹280 crore in the first quarter. That will further increase due to increment in the volume capacity utilization in the overseas market. Lastly, the iron ore price reduction that happened partially in both September and October will come in. Even though this has not happened to the extent it has happened globally, the benefit will be there. These are some of the neutralizing factors that will reduce the cost to some extent. Are Chinese policies impacting the steel sector? There are completely different dynamics that are playing out in China and outside China based on which the Chinese policies are getting calibrated. One is the common prosperity and the second is decarbonization. Basis these two, they are putting in policies in a manner that they limit production of steel, limit exports and move into high-end value-added segment. The impact is that new property investments started falling and that had an impact on overall steel demand in China. In the last one year, steel demand has fallen by 23% in China. However, in the rest of the world, demand is strong mainly due to revival in manufacturing, investments by the government, energy transition, lower interest rates and high amount of liquidity, ensuring and influencing revival for steel. According to the World Steel Association, steel demand would come down by 1% in China, translating to 10 million tonnes (mt) of lower demand in China, while the rest of the world will see steel demand grow by 11.5%, translating to 90 mt. This means there is an incremental demand of 80 mt, which will translate to 4.5 times of growth in steel demand. Therefore, as far as the steel demand dynamics is concerned, China is not an influencing factor. So, how do you see the steel demand and supply situation panning out? Indian steel consumption in the first six months of this financial year was 49 mt against 36.5 mt in the previous year. That means we have consumed almost 13 mt more steel in the first six months of the year. Even though the second quarter was subdued, our expectation is that post-monsoon, the construction and infrastructure sector will pick up. We are already seeing traction in the residential sector side and the government expenditure side. In the second half, we see that there will be an acceleration in steel demand in India. There is a huge opportunity to fill up the space being vacated by China in the export market, particularly in Asia. And India can fill up that gap."
Updated: 24 Oct 2021,JSW Steel plans to levy surcharge steel products as input cost mounts,https://www.livemint.com/companies/jsw-steel-plans-to-levy-surcharge-steel-products-as-input-cost-mounts-11635057027743.html,"NEW DELHI : To offset the rising input cost, domestic steel giant JSW Steel is planning to levy a surcharge on sale of its steel products to its long-term OEM (original equipment manufacturer) customers, according to a top company official. JSW Steel will be the first company to introduce the concept of surcharge to the domestic steel market. There is a huge pressure on the cost of production. Cost of per tonne steel production went up by 19 per cent or ₹6,600 per tonne quarter-on-quarter in July-September 2021, Seshagiri Rao, Joint Managing Director and Group CFO, JSW Steel, said. The rate of coking coal -- a key steelmaking raw material for which players remain dependent on imports -- has also gone up from USD 120 a tonne to USD 400 a tonne in just four weeks, he told PTI in an interview. When asked whether the company is looking to pass on the burden of increased raw material and production cost to its customers in the form of a duty or surcharge, he replied in affirmative. ""We have been working on (something) what is happening globally. The coking coal prices went up by four times from USD 120 per tonne to USD 400 a tonne in just last four weeks. Thermal coal prices have gone up. ""This kind of volatility is very difficult to absorb for a steel company. If we look at in Europe, one steel company has introduced a 50 euro surcharge and in the UK, a steel company introduced two surcharges totaling 25 pounds,"" Rao said, explaining the rationale behind the move. The first company is charging 50 euro as energy surcharge, while the second one is charging 20 pounds as energy surcharge and 5 pounds as transportation surcharge, he said without naming the entities. The concept of surcharge would be new to India but it is not new in the global markets, he said. Replying to a question if it would be feasible to levy surcharge on the sale of steel products in the highly price sensitive Indian market, the official said JSW Steel will take its customers into confidence for this new concept. ""Because of the volatility (in the market) we are also contemplating discussing it with our customers."" Rao further said there are three segments where the sales are made. The segments are namely retail, exports and the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) customers. In the retail segment there is already a price fluctuation on a daily basis, so the surcharge concept would not work in this segment, and in the exports, prices depend on various other markers. ""The third segment is OEM customers with long term relationships...there it is possible. The concept has to be explained to them,"" he said. Rao, however, did not elaborate on the amount which will be levied as surcharge but said it will be equally proportional to the ""high raw material"" prices. There will be a base. If the raw prices go beyond that, the surcharge will be calculated accordingly."
