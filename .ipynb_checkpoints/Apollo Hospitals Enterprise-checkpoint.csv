Updated: 07 Jun 2022,"Adani, Apollo explore  bids  for majority stake in Metropolis",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/adani-apollo-explore-bids-for-majority-stake-in-metropolis-11654539475699.html,"Billionaire Gautam Adani and Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd, the country’s biggest operator of hospitals, are evaluating bids to pick up a majority stake in diagnostic chain Metropolis Healthcare Ltd, two people familiar with the development said. The deal size, given the market cap of Metropolis and its operations across the country, could be at least $1 billion ( ₹7,765 crore), they added. Last month, Mint reported that Adani Group is planning a massive foray into the healthcare sector and may acquire large hospitals, diagnostic chains, and both offline and digital pharmacies. The group is said to have earmarked as much as $4 billion for the business, to gain a foothold in the healthcare space and is talking to investors and lenders to devise a long-term funding plan. A Metropolis spokesperson declined to comment on the development, whereas email queries sent to Adani Group and Apollo Hospitals went unanswered till press time. Adani Group is one of India’s largest business conglomerates, with more than $20 billion in annual revenue. It has a presence in power, green energy, infrastructure, food processing, and airports, among other industries. Metropolis started as a single lab in the 1980s and received its first external funding of ₹35 crore from private equity firm ICICI Venture in 2005. This was followed by $85 million from PE firm Warburg Pincus, providing an exit to ICICI Venture. In 2015, the founding Shah family bought back a 27% stake of Warburg Pincus for ₹550 crore, with the backing of KKR India. Later in 2015, the company brought marquee investor Carlyle on board when the PE firm bought out co-promoter GSK Velu’s stake in a controversial board battle. The pathology chain operates in 19 states in India, with a strong presence in the western and southern regions."

The company is in early discussions with several global strategic investors and other potential purchasers of the shares, said the people, asking not to be identified because the deliberations aren’t public. Metropolis, traded in Mumbai with a market value of $1.1 billion -- about half what it was at the start of the year -- tapped Barclays as an adviser, they said. A deal would likely include a sale of primary shares as well as secondary shares by existing investors, including the managing director, that could take the deal size over $300 million. Walmart Inc.-owned retailer Flipkart and listed health-care chain Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd. are among potential strategic investors that have signed non-disclosure agreements with Metropolis, while Amazon.com Inc. has held preliminary discussions, said one of the people. Agreements are also in place with global funds including KKR & Co., TPG Inc. and Barings, the person said, while talks are ongoing with Blackstone Inc. Representatives of Metropolis Healthcare, Amazon, Apollo Hospitals, Barings, Blackstone, KKR and TPG declined to comment. Flipkart did not respond to emails seeking comment. A representative for Barclays declined to comment. Shares of Metropolis fell as much as 3.1% on Friday. They have halved since the start of the year amid a broader tech selloff and concerns about intensifying competition. Metropolis runs more than 3,000 diagnostics centers as well as pathology laboratories in India and Africa. It has grown as consumers sought out branded operators for tests and scans during the pandemic. The chain was founded in 1981 by Sushil Shah, whose daughter Ameera Shah has since taken the reins. Ameera Shah currently owns 50% of the company and could offload some of her shares in a secondary transaction that could increase the size of the deal, a person familiar with the discussions said. Diagnostics chains have become targets for the likes of Amazon and Walmart, which are ramping up health-care services to add to their retail offerings in India. Spending on preventive health care such as testing is rising in the country of 1.4 billion people, driven by chronic and lifestyle-related diseases and an aging population. Intensifying competition is driving consolidation, with online pharmacy startup Pharmeasy buying a majority stake in publicly traded diagnostics chain Thyrocare Technologies last year for $612 million. Metropolis acquired diagnostic chain Hitech Diagnostic Centre for 6.36 billion rupees ($82 million) last year. To remain competitive, diagnostics companies need to invest heavily in newer technology and equipment and strengthen their online offerings. Despite the hits to its market price, Metropolis said it is focusing on expansion. It plans to start 1,800 collection centers in the next three years, the company said in an exchange filing.  It will boost its home collection service to 200 locations within two years, it said in its most recent earnings filing in February.

Multiple growth drivers remain intact, according to analysts. The hospital business grew 26% sequentially and 145% year-on-year (y-o-y), with an improved occupancy level. The average revenue per operating bed (ARPOB) also showed improvement. The Q1FY22 occupancy in mature hospitals remained stable at 64%. New hospitals, on the other hand, reported a significant jump in occupancy to 73% compared to 60% a quarter ago. As much as 26% of the business during the quarter was a result of covid-19. Analysts are hopeful of healthier growth due to the normalization of business mix, increase in elective surgeries and other factors that may bode well for margins. New hospitals have shown profitability with most of them achieving break-even. Proactive capacity addition has also benefited the company. “We expect strong 57.5% growth in the hospitals business in FY22 on a low base, consolidation of the Kolkata hospital and incremental revenue from vaccination,"" analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd wrote in a note. The firm’s pharmacy business grew by 35% sequentially and reported decent improvement in the margin to 7.6% from 7.1% in the previous quarter. This was aided by an increased share in private labels to 13.24%, which is far better than the 9% historically. The company had separated the front-end pharmacy business and Apollo 24/7 into a separate subsidiary, Apollo HealthCo Ltd, to improve its e-commerce platform. The Apollo 24/7 platform is scaling up well and analysts at HDFC Securities Ltd expect revenues to reach $50 million to $60 million by the end of FY22. They expect Apollo 24/7 to break even by FY24 and expect the company’s diagnostics business to see a steady ramp-up and achieve revenue of ₹500 crore by FY23. “We expect improvement in performance to continue in the ensuing quarters supported by higher occupancy, cost control initiatives and continuous growth momentum in the pharmacy segment,"" said the ICICI Securities note. They expect 25.5% revenue and 51.8% earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization on a compound annual growth rate basis over FY21-FY23 on a low base of FY21."

Updated: 01 May 2021,Some private hospital chains start jab drive for adults today,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/some-private-hospital-chains-start-jab-drive-for-adults-today-11619807439884.html,"Three of India’s largest hospital chains—Apollo Hospitals Enterprise, Max Healthcare Institute and Fortis Healthcare—on Friday announced that a few hospitals in their network will start vaccinating all adults from Saturday, including those in the age group 18-44 years who were not part of the vaccination drive earlier. While Fortis Healthcare will only be using Bharat Biotech International’s Covaxin, Max Healthcare will be using Serum Institute of India’s Covishield. Apollo Hospitals will be vaccinating all adults with both Covaxin and Covishield. All three hospitals said the expanded drive will begin with limited quantities of jabs, which will be ramped up in the coming weeks. “Fortis will administer covid vaccines for 18+ at its centres across North India from tomorrow (1 May). Fortis centres in other cities will commence vaccination as soon as supplies are made available by authorities,"" a spokesperson for Fortis Healthcare said in a statement. For now, Max Healthcare will be making vaccines available only at its facilities in the National Capital Region—at Panchsheel Park, Patpatganj, Shalimar Bagh, Noida and Vaishali and the BLK Super Speciality Hospital at Rajinder Place, the hospital chain said in a statement. As per government guidelines, all vaccinations will only be done through prior appointment on the government’s Co-WIN platform, and no vaccine would be administered on a walk-in basis. Apollo Hospitals will charge ₹1,200 for administering a dose of Covaxin. The hospital will charge ₹800 for administering a dose of Covishield, wherein ₹600 will be the cost of a dose as charged by Serum Institute and ₹200 will be administration charges. Fortis Healthcare will charge ₹1,250 per dose of Covaxin, with ₹50 as administration cost. Max Healthcare will publish its prices on its website later, a spokesperson for the company said. The start of the vaccination drive has come at a time when the country is facing a massive surge in covid cases in the second wave, with India recording 386,773 new cases on Thursday, a record increase, while on Friday the addition of confirmed patients was at 352,435 at 10.30pm. “The second wave has come like a tsunami with an exponential rise in the number of cases. The government’s decision to open up the vaccination program and permit private hospitals to procure vaccines directly from the manufacturers is a much-required step to counter the covid threat,"" Apollo Hospitals executive vice-chairperson Shobana Kamineni said in a statement. The start of the vaccination drive at all private hospitals contrasts with delays reported by states like Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, who have said they will be unable to start vaccination due to a shortage of doses. Even among private hospitals, it is only a few large ones that would be getting the vaccine. A spokesperson for Manipal hospitals said they will not start vaccinating all adults as there is no clarity on availability of vaccines. Aster DM Healthcare’s hospitals in India will also not be administering covid-19 vaccines. “We have spoken to all the major vaccine manufacturers, and none of them currently have sufficient stock for the private sector,"" Harish Pillai, chief executive officer of Aster India, said in a statement."

Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd. has so far trained 6,000 staff to give out jabs across its network of 71 hospitals, hundreds of clinics and thousands of pharmacies, according to Managing Director Suneeta Reddy, who said the company’s talks with officials in New Delhi had yet to provide any firm guidance. “We need to know if the government wants to handle the whole thing or allow the private sector to do it,"" Reddy said in an interview Tuesday. “The issue here is how can we double the amount of people that can be vaccinated,"" she said from Chennai, adding that Apollo is ready to help in any capacity. The government “can do it, but it will take time."" Also read: The pandemic push to the silver economy How and if India decides to work with its large network of private hospitals on vaccine distribution could be crucial to any success in reining in the world’s second-worst outbreak, which has inflicted deep economic damage. India may start inoculation efforts within weeks as front-running developers apply for emergency authorization. There will be a “flood of Covid vaccines"" in the next five to six months, Krishna Ella, the chairman of Bharat Biotech International Ltd. -- which is producing one of India’s leading indigenous candidates -- told a conference on Tuesday. Apollo has been telling clients via its digital app that a shot “should be available in 60-120 days"" and customers will “be the first ones to know about the vaccines."" Capacity Concerns Companies vying to roll out those vaccines, along with public health experts, have raised concerns about India’s capacity to swiftly inoculate its population of about 1.3 billion people. There are also fears of unequal access, given the enormous wealth disparities across India’s cities and vast hinterlands. Apollo Hospitals has held talks with the Serum Institute of India Ltd., the world’s largest vaccine maker which has already produced millions of doses of AstraZeneca Plc’s shot. But Reddy said developers are waiting on direction from New Delhi “because all of them have committed capacity to the government first."" Rajesh Bhushan, secretary to the federal health ministry, told Bloomberg last month that India will rely on its national immunization network, which currently targets 26.7 million newborns and 29 million pregnant women every year. Experts believe that system will need to be significantly built up with help from private players to meet India’s needs. Private hospitals in India have been criticized for sitting on the sidelines of the coronavirus crisis. Though the private sector accounts for around 60% of India’s total hospital bed capacity, there were widely reported instances of some private hospitals and doctors refusing to treat Covid-19 patients as cases accelerated in India starting from June. Apollo has treated more than 30,000 Covid patients and provided about 400,000 tests, said Suneeta Reddy, one of four daughters of octogenarian founder Prathap C. Reddy, who established the company in 1983. India has nearly 10 million cases of the coronavirus, and is adding over 30,000 new infections daily. The firm saw a “lost quarter"" following the sudden decision by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to impose a draconian national lockdown in March with little notice, she said. The company suffered a loss of 2.08 billion rupees ($28 million) in the three months through June, though it’s seeing a better-than-expected recovery, posting net income of 602.7 million rupees in the latest quarter. Medical Tourism With about 12% of the firm’s revenue derived from international customers, Apollo has received a blow from the near total disappearance of thousands of overseas patients who visit India each year. Until October, India had closed its borders to medical tourism, a market that was expected to be worth $9 billion in 2020, according to the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry. A rise in local demand has compensated for that loss, Reddy said. Many wealthy Indian patients who used to go abroad for treatments are now Apollo’s customers. Occupancy rates across Apollo’s hospitals now runs at about 67%, close to pre-pandemic levels. Roughly 15%-20% of those are Covid patients in specially segregated facilities, she said. The company will raise up to 15 billion rupees through an equity issue in January, Reddy said. The proceeds will be used to acquire IHH Healthcare Bhd.’s remaining 50% stake in a Kolkata hospital, reduce Apollo’s debt, as well as fund upgrades of its digital app and any potential bolt-on acquisitions.

But new regulations, which capped prices of procedures and devices, laid speed-breakers on the hospital highway. In fact, most of the hospital sector stocks seem to be in the intensive care. Barring Apollo Hospitals Enterprises Ltd, which gained 40% the past year, all gave negative returns. A shift to the new tax regime could be beneficial though. The government’s corporate tax cut to 22% excluding surcharge is expected to boost earnings of hospitals that are paying full taxes such as Narayana Hrudalaya Ltd. Other hospital chains that are availing exemptions are likely to shift to the new tax regime. “Full tax paying companies are likely to benefit the most from the reduction in effective tax rates while hospital operators such as Apollo Hospitals, which avail of benefits arising out of 35AD, are likely to move to the new tax regime, given no plans of expansion/commissioning of units in the near term where the 35AD benefit applies. Aster DM Healthcare Ltd derived the bulk of its revenues (83%) from its Gulf-countries operations, which will not be impacted by the reforms, while its India operations are PBT negative and are unlikely to see any benefit in the near term,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities in a note to clients. While tax cuts will help, a revival in operating margins remains a challenge. Hospital chains aggressively expanded their bed capacity up until FY17, adding about 2,380 beds, the highest in the previous five years. That has slowed considerably as only 622 beds were added in FY19. New hospitals take time to mature, leading to higher expenditures, taking a toll on margins. Overall Ebitda margins contracted to 12.4% in FY19 from 14.9% in FY15. Analysts note that hospital chains have started to make small price increases on procedures. They are also focusing on cost rationalization and looking at ways to monetize existing assets. Some of the factors likely to aid the hospital sector are incidences of rising lifestyle diseases, increasing life expectancy, deeper health-insurance penetration, and the rise in medical tourism. “The focus now is to try and stabilize the operational facilities rather than expand aggressively. Regulatory restrictions had impacted the business, but price increase and cost rationalizations have been done now and are helping to improve the operating metrics. Many players have seen a good recovery in the second half of FY19 and Q1FY20"", said Kapil Banga, assistant vice president, corporate ratings, Icra Ltd. That would mean that the slowdown in the capital expenditure of the last two years may look up in the coming years. As for the stocks, recovery is likely to take more time."

The aim now is to keep patients first as the group strives to deliver the best patient care, says Sangita Reddy, managing director of the hospital chain with a capacity of 10,000 beds. Electronic health records, drones and novel IT initiatives are accelerating innovation and transforming healthcare at Apollo, Reddy said in an interview. Edited excerpts: Q: A lot of activity has been seen in the healthcare space with many hospital chains looking to acquire large hospitals. Why is Apollo never been seen in this race? India has a shortage of over 70,000 hospital beds; the chairman in the Apollo group (Prathap C. Reddy) is committed to improving the healthcare of the country. So, you don’t improve the healthcare of the country by doing financial deals; any money we take we put up a new bed and that will add to the service of the country. By buying a hospital or acquiring it, you are cutting short the cycle. We bought a hospital in Guwahati, we are adding 150 beds to that infrastructure; we bought into a hospital in Indore, Lucknow... So we do, but we don’t do acquisition and mergers of advanced hospital systems because there is no win-win for the public. We add beds so we can serve more people. Fortis is serving, it’s a good thing…Let them serve. In the culture of an advanced hospital, we are very different, they are culturally very different and we can’t maintain the same ethos of service that we have because our ideology is very different. So we will not see more Apollos in times to come? I think what you will see is our ability to serve and care for more and more patients. Whether we do that through adding beds or adding clinics or doing more preventive care, we will continue to serve, we will stay committed to bringing advanced care. Apollo was in news for being in search for a foreign investor to offload some debt; is it true? No; there is nothing. With Artificial Intelligence becoming a crucial part in clinical practice, do you think its impact on patients needs to be better understood? In September, we have a conferences on themes like international patient safety conference and transforming healthcare with IT. While we are focused on safety, the whole idea is provisioning of care, then it’s quality of care... In the pursuit of quality, it became quite visible that safety is a very important aspect. It is estimated that one in 10 patients anywhere in the world including developing countries have some incidence of unsafe care and 420 million people are hospitalized. So, that means 42 million people are suffering from some kind of adverse event. All associations of hospitals and healthcare have come together to fight hospital-acquired infections, unsafe surgeries, unsafe injections, wrong medication, wrong dosage of medication, antibiotic misuse.. A range of things. Does technology upgradation also jack up hospitalisation charges? In the Indian context, it is a really good question, but let me give you two-three angles. People typically think of cost of care, they take a certain procedure and analyse that procedure; for example, in case of a gall stone surgery, it may be free for some patients in a government hospital, may cost ₹5,000-20,000 in a government set-up, may cost ₹35,000 in a nursing home and may cost up to ₹75,000 in Apollo, but the infection rate, the pain to the patient is much low. I think more importantly, it’s not just comparing these two costs but comparing the way you get the procedure done; so I think 60% if not more of India can afford ₹10,000 for health insurance; if you spend ₹10,000 for health insurance, they will pay your ₹70,000 bill when you need it. But it’s not easy. Getting an insurance company to pay for your hospital bills is a difficult task? There is a need for simplification of insurance procedure because there is no way that public can afford advanced healthcare by paying out of pocket. There is no country in the world where good healthcare is paid for out of pocket. Since we are talking about insurance, what do you think about the government’s Ayushman Bharat scheme? It is an incredible, bold and appropriate move by the government. In fact, Apollo has been saying for 20 years about Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Even in the US, you have MediCare and MedicAid, which is the government-funded social security system for healthcare. And then, there is private insurance for people who do no fall under that bracket but the point is that if people cannot afford to pay out of pocket for healthcare, they should never be asked to pay out of pocket. The 5% of people who get sick, their cost should be borne by the 95% people who do not have a procedure that year. And when you keep on paying every year, more than 60% of India can afford health insurance premiums. The current coverage is under 20%. So, India should create an awareness, simplify the procedure. You should get an insurance claim approved in three minutes like your credit card. It should be as simple as that; that’s what we should push for, but to say that a hospitals should reduce the price because insurance is difficult is not a long-term solution. In the age of AI and electronic health records, there is also a worry of systems getting hacked. How do you ensure that the patient’s privacy is not compromised? This is a super question but do you stop doing mobile banking because your credit card may be hacked? You depend on someone to create appropriate fire walls and protocols so that your data is safe; same thing is what we have to insist in Indian healthcare, which is what we are doing in National Digital Health Policy -- standards for maintaining data. We should not shy away from going digital in healthcare because we are worried about our data. We should find ways to keep our data safe; this is the way of the future and healthcare should not be left behind. "
