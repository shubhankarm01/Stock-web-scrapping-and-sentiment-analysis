Updated: 06 Jun 2022,‘The world around us has turned more digital-savvy’,https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/the-world-around-us-has-turned-more-digitalsavvy-11654457755809.html,"NEW DELHI : India’s rural marketing landscape is set to change, said Amit Doshi, chief marketing officer at Bengaluru-based Britannia Industries Ltd, the maker of Good Day, Tiger, NutriChoice, Milk Bikis and Marie Gold biscuit brands. In an interview, Doshi, who had stints in Lenovo and Perfetti Van Melle, spoke of the acceleration in digital media consumption, evolution of the influencer ecosystem and the need for brands to be more empathetic in a post-covid world. Edited excerpts:   After covid-19, are brands weaving more sympathy into their messaging?  The pandemic taught marketers to be far more humane and connected with what was happening around us. There’s been a debate around purpose-led advertising, but this (pandemic) was a very different situation. I really hope that brands continue to stay humane. But at the same time, it’s very important that brands are not opportunistic about a situation like this. There is a certain role that categories and brands play in consumers’ lives and it’s extremely important that marketers are aware of where the line is. So, I would say that while it’s a good sign, it’s very important to know what role a brand can or cannot play in difficult situations. During covid, advertising for almost all of our brands turned contextual. We realized that while consumers were staying at home, they were also vulnerable to unhealthy eating. So, NutriChoice advertising was still about healthy snacking, but making sure that your hands don’t go to something unhealthy. Coming out of covid, I feel that all of us, including Britannia, need to be extremely close to the consumer. Because we’re also seeing some of the habits reverse as quickly; people are going back, they are travelling, kids are back to school.  Has the pandemic brought about a rapid shift in media spends? I’m a big believer in taking a balanced approach to marketing and media planning. It’s the classical approach of horses for courses. It completely depends on the markets that we’re speaking to, the socio-economic strata that consumers belong to. Media habits are very varied in a complex market like India. So, depending on the challenge that we have at hand, we work with first principles (of marketing) and come up with a media plan. Having said that, yes, we’ve seen digital media habits change dramatically during the pandemic. This year, that growth will accelerate. If you look projections by prominent media agencies, the prediction is that digital media spends this year will overtake those on television. That means we’ve got to keep with the pace of change, perhaps even stay ahead of the curve.  How much of this digital adoption is changing rural marketing? Has there been a fundamental change in consumer media habits on account of digital?  100%. It’s a massive change that we are seeing unfold in front of our eyes. If you see the influx of content consumption—all of these are trends that cut across the country. The world around us has definitely turned more digital-savvy, post-covid. That’s true of rural consumers as well. Cheap data connectivity, along with a smartphone at hand, and content consumption becoming more democratic, more vernacular, is certainly going to change the way the rural consumers consume media. If you look at the content creator ecosystem, content creation in India is actually bursting open across all strata of the economy. It’s not just a metro or urban phenomenon. Tomorrow’s biggest content creators are actually coming from small towns and rural centres. This will further accelerate consumption.  So, in all forms of digital, whether it’s social media, or its content platforms, like Jio, or even the digital editions of vernacular newspapers, there’s a lot of consumption that’s happening. The supply side is exploding, because the content creator ecosystem is no longer just coming from urban India. Finally, as FMCG expands on e-commerce, the pin code coverage will also increase.  If you look at all of this, I do feel that rural marketing as we know it, will change dramatically. There are some early experiments that we’re seeing in the industry.  How big is influencer marketing for Britannia? For me, influencers form one more conduit to engage with consumers. But I would say the work that most industries and companies in India still do with influencers is very scratchy where there is a product placement, and influencers carry it in their content.  Do we participate in that?  Of course, we do. So, in one case, we’ve helped transform a consumer into an influencer for the local community and now they’re the face of the brand.  In another case, which is for Marie Gold Jeera, we’ve actually used homemakers, who had clout and influence in the social media ecosystem, to actually help us develop products."

Updated: 02 Apr 2022,More consumers switch to smaller packs as inflation pinches,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/more-consumers-switch-to-smaller-packs-as-inflation-pinches-11648838494236.html,"New Delhi: Indian consumers have started purchasing smaller packs of packaged goods as high inflation puts pressure on household budgets. Contribution of low-priced packs to overall sales within categories such as beverages, personal care and commodities moved up by 2%, 4% and 10.5% respectively in rural India between January and first week of March, according to data shared by retail technology platform Bizom. In urban India, contribution from lower price points in categories such as confectionery, commodities, home care and packaged foods moved up by 2.8%, 2.9%, 5.9% and 13.7% respectively. Commodities consist of packaged and branded edible oils, spices, rice, and flour. To be sure, a switch to low priced packs in categories such as confectionery and beverages was also driven by a strong return in out-of-home consumption during the period. Meanwhile, contribution of high value packs across all categories in urban India reported a decline, as per the retail intelligence platform that tracks sales across 7.5 million retail stores. Bizom compared the data to pre-covid period or 2020. “Across both urban and rural India, we see a strong trend of increased consumption across lower price points. Price inflation is among the key drivers of this shift across categories especially among commodity products driven by hyper-inflation in these products,"" said Akshay D’Souza, chief of growth and insights, Bizom. Companies selling everything from soaps, detergents to biscuits and edible oils have taken price hikes—prompting shoppers to look at cheaper or value alternatives. On Thursday Bloomberg reported that cake and cookie maker Britannia Industries Ltd. plans to hike prices as much as 7%. In large categories such as soaps, detergents, shampoo, biscuits and edible oils, price hikes have been to the tune of 15-20% year-on-year within key stock keeping units, analysts at BNP Paribas India said in a report dated 17 March. They noted that such price hikes were insufficient to offset cost inflation. They also flagged some downtrading within the fast-moving consumer goods market. “With price increase ahead of income growth, sector volume growth moderated and we see likelihood of some downtrading. After large price increases in the preceding period, we have seen relatively lower price hikes in Jan-March 2022, as companies could have been looking for consumers to absorb the recent price hikes and expecting commodity costs to moderate,"" they said. Meanwhile, consumers switched to cheaper packets in commodities such as edible oils and pulses. In personal care, fewer social interactions were prompting consumers to purchase lower usage packs, especially in rural areas, the Bizom data revealed. “With more price inflation on the horizon, we will see pressure on personal care and other discretionary products as consumers could look to rationalize their monthly spends by cutting on usage here,"" said D’Souza. In home care, data pointed to consumer preference toward high price point packs in rural. “In urban the wide availability of hygiene products is leading to this shift while rural consumers still seem to be buying longer duration packs as availability of their preferred brands seems to be erratic,"" the firm said in its findings. Meanwhile, companies said higher fuel prices could put pressure on household budgets, especially, for socio-economic classes B and C. “While we have not witnessed that in our business because it’s an everyday consumption item—be it milk or curd but I’m sure there is an inflationary pressure on consumers and across categories. Especially SEC B and C consumers are feeling the pinch of petroleum prices,"" said Sanjay Sharma, Business Head, dairy products, Mother Dairy Fruit & Vegetable Pvt. Ltd. Companies are likely to push cheaper and smaller stock keeping units, said others. “Consumers will downgrade to smaller and cheaper brands as well as. You will find better distribution for cheaper stock keeping units, that is, at price points of Rs10 and Rs20,"" said Aditya Goel, co-founder of Love in Store, a trade activation and execution company that works with FMCG companies and retailers. Bizom said within beverages demand trends indicate that mid-sized packs are leading growth. “Out of home packs for what is expected to be a warm summer and the upcoming IPL season, can help spike consumption at home too,"" said D’Souza. Parle Agro that sells juices and fizzy drinks said demand for its products remained firm as mobility improved. The company that sells Frooti and Appy Fizz beverages has not taken any price hikes in order to keep demand intact. “Two of our largest segments are really value packs which are at the Rs10 and lower price points. And then the larger value packs, which are for home consumption, those are two of our largest segments. From a value for money perspective that’s been something we’re very conscious of, and we’ve been able to provide that to consumers consistently,"" said Nadia Chauhan, JMD and CMO, Parle Agro."
Updated: 26 Mar 2022,It's raining earnings downgrades but these stocks offer some respite,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/its-raining-earnings-downgrades-but-these-stocks-offer-some-respite-11648185069187.html,"The steep increase in prices of raw materials such as crude oil and metals following the Russia-Ukraine conflict has exposed many Indian companies to severe margin pressure, an analysis by domestic brokerage house IIFL Securities Ltd showed that. This is anticipated to lead to an increased risk of earnings downgrades. ""What began as an earnings sensitivity analysis has now started appearing more like an earnings downgrade expectation, because the values we assumed for the purpose of sensitivity for key variables − Brent crude (US$110), LME Metals Index (5000), US$/INR (78) and interest rates (100 basis points higher) − have begun looking like the more-likely levels that will sustain in FY23,"" IIFL said in a report on 23 March. One basis point is one hundredeth of a percentage point. Investors should note that many companies across the board rely on crude-based derivatives as inputs. For some companies, plastic products which are byproducts of crude, hurt their packing costs. These include cement, tyres, fast moving consumer goods and paint makers, among others. For the purpose of this analysis, IIFL has identified stocks price behaviour starting 23 February, when news flow on the war started impacting the markets. Results showed that CEAT Ltd, Apollo Tyres Ltd, MRF Ltd, Indian Oil, Kansai Nerolac, Paints Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd, Century Plyboards India Ltd, Havells India Ltd, Nykaa (FSN E-commerce Ventures Ltd), Berger Paints (I) Ltd, Cipla Ltd and CRISIL Ltd are the stocks where risks of a earnings downgrade is emerging. On the other hand, there are some stocks at odds with the broking frim's expectation of earnings vulnerability. Coforge Ltd, Quess Corp Ltd, Britannia Industries Ltd, L&T Infotech, Tanla Platforms Ltd, Mphasis Ltd, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Bharat Forge Ltd and PNC Infratech Ltdare the stocks where there are upgrade opportunities, added the IIFL report."

Updated: 11 Mar 2022,Colgate Vs Godrej: A tale of two CEO hires,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/colgate-vs-godrej-a-tale-of-two-ceo-hires-11646994170490.html,"Shares of Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd. were unchanged on Friday on the National Stock Exchange after it announced a change of guard at the company. Colgate has named Prabha Narasimhan as its new managing director and chief executive officer (MD and CEO) effective 1 September. Prima facie, Colgate’s investors’ response widely contrasts with the euphoria seen in May last year when Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. (GCPL) had said Sudhir Sitapati will be appointed MD and CEO. Recall that GCPL’s shares had risen 22% following the notification on 12 May to nearly ₹873 apiece. Sachin Bobade, analyst Dolat Capital Market Pvt. Ltd, said, ""In GCPL’s case, the stock did trace back to its initial levels post the heavy reaction to the leadership change. The market seems to be factoring this, which could explain the muted reaction of the Colgate stock on the change in leadership.""  Further, investors may have anticipated relatively higher growth opportunities in the categories GCPL operates in following the change. Not only that, Nisaba Godrej, who occupied the MD’s office prior to Sitapati, is part of the promoter group and as such the change in leadership would have come as a relief because investors tend to worry about concentration of power. As things stand, GCPL’s shares now trade at ₹710, partly bogged down by higher palm oil prices of late. Also, in general, sentiments towards FMCG stocks have been subdued recently due to elevated input cost pressures along with weak rural demand conditions. Even so, leadership changes in FMCG companies are typically viewed as exciting. CEO changes at Britannia Industries Ltd, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), and Dabur India Ltd. in the past suggest that a new leader could drive significant shareholder value. “To be sure, a change in leadership can actually change the dynamics for Colgate. If the new CEO focuses on enhancing distribution, more advertising campaigns, and new launches it may boost volumes and growth, eventually,"" says Bobade. Narasimhan brings more than two decades of experience in various categories across consumer marketing and development roles. In her last role, she served as executive director of Home Care at HUL.  “With market-share gains limited due to elevated competitive intensity (largely from the ayurvedic/naturals segment and HUL stepping up new launches with new formulations), we believe a fresh perspective from outside the industry can bring in cross-pollination of fresh ideas and strategies from other consumer categories,"" said analysts at Nomura in a report on 10 March. In particular, Colgate’s market share decline and muted revenue growth has been a concern. “The combination of sharp decline in market share in recent years and the increased penetration of the category itself have resulted in single-digit topline growth over the last 10 years. In recent years, premiumization has also come off, affecting realization growth (v/s the past),"" said analysts from Motilal Oswal Financial Services in their Q3FY22 review report.  The brokerage added, “For a company with a modest base of ₹2,040 crore in sales in FY10, a sales/Ebitda/PBT CAGR of 8–10% over the last 10 years is a weak result."" CAGR is compounded annual growth rate. The bright spot, however, is that valuations are undemanding. Colgate’s stock trades at 36 times FY23 estimated earnings, Bloomberg data shows. However, near-term scope for meaningful upsides appears limited. “Colgate is entering a low-growth period with the absence of any sustainable triggers to drive incremental growth. We await details of any new strategies from incoming CEO Ms. Narasimhan before turning constructive,"" added the Nomura report."
Updated: 31 Jan 2022,"Britannia’s Q3 margin drags, revenue shines",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/britannias-q3-margin-drags-revenue-shines-11643563568401.html,"Britannia Industries Ltd had to battle a tough cost environment during the December quarter (Q3FY22) owing to persistent commodity cost inflation. While the packaged foods company’s gross margin was expected to drop year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q3, the extent of decline was more than expected. Last quarter, Britannia’s consolidated gross margin shrank as much as 518 basis points (bps) versus the year-ago period to 37.9%. One basis point is 0.01%. This is also the third consecutive quarter of y-o-y drop in Britannia’s gross margin. In Q1 and Q2, too, the company’s gross margin had dropped by 502bps and 296bps, y-o-y, respectively. The company said it continued to see an increase in commodity prices in Q3, with inflation about 4% sequentially and about 20% y-o-y. “We actioned price increases ahead of competition. But the upward trajectory in prices of commodities and fuel impacted profitability, which led us to action further price increases and accelerate cost efficiency programmes,"" said Britannia. It is somewhat comforting that the gross margin has improved sequentially, though below expectations. Further, a fall in employee costs helped curb the drop in Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margin a bit. Ebitda margin dropped by 422bps y-o-y to 15.1%. The upshot: Ebitda in Q3 fell by 11.7% to about ₹540 crore. This is at a time when Britannia’s revenue performance beat expectations, with operating revenues increasing by 13.7% y-o-y to ₹3,531 crore. “Strong growth in revenue was buoyed by volume growth of about 5% (we expected +4%) and net realizations being higher by about 8.5% (versus our forecast of 7.5%),"" said analysts from JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd in a report on 29 January. “Britannia’s ability to sustain volume growth at this level despite price hikes in the category is commendable, especially as nearly two-thirds of the price hikes (for price-pointed packs) need to be effected by grammage adjustments,"" the broker added. In the past one year, Britannia’s shares have declined by 2.6% vis-à-vis the 7.6% gain in the Nifty FMCG index. Bloomberg data shows the stock trades at almost 43 times estimated earnings for FY23. While valuations may not seem demanding, near-term triggers for the stock appear limited. Hereon, investors would closely track the impact on volumes, owing to subdued rural demand. In general, easing commodity costs will bring much needed relief to consumer companies, including Britannia."

Total revenue from operations at the biscuit and butter maker grew 13% to ₹3,574.98 crore against the ₹3,165.61 crore reported a year ago. The company flagged a “significant"" slowdown in rural markets for makers of fast-moving consumer goods. “We delivered a high single digit volume growth significantly ahead of the market and a resilient double-digit top-line growth of 14%, driven by superlative performance across divisions and channels. While the rural markets across FMCG witnessed significant slowdown, we were able to maintain a significant competitive advantage through our focus to enhance rural footprint and our diligent market practices, which is reflected in the robust top-line growth and consistent gain in market share,"" said Varun Berry, Managing Director, Britannia Industries Ltd. Berry said the company continued to witness increased commodity prices with an inflation of 4% quarter-on-quarter and 20% over last year. Cost of material consumed during the quarter grew 22% year-on-year for the maker of Good Day and Marie Gold biscuits. Total expenses during the quarter were up 18.5% to touch ₹3,123.02 crore year-on-year. This is despite the company reporting a marginal dip in employee benefit expenses. As market leaders, we actioned price increases ahead of competition, said Berry. “However, the upward trajectory in prices of commodities and fuel impacted profitability, which led us to action further price increases and accelerate cost efficiency programs,"" he said. Companies across the board have been facing inflationary headwinds with prices of everything from raw materials to packaging material and transportation moving up. Mint had earlier reported that rival Parle Products plans to continue price hikes till the end of the current financial year. During the quarter the company relaunched its power brand “Good Day"" backed by TV, print and outdoor media, and visibility drives, towards the end of the quarter. “We are confident that our resilient brands and strategic growth initiatives will hold us on a path of sustainable and profitable share gain in the future as well,"" said Berry."

In an open letter to companies such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd., Marico, Dabur India, ITC Ltd., Britannia Industries, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd., Nestle India, etc the industry body has called for a non-cooperation movement from 1 January against FMCG companies if their needs are not addressed. The federation that represents over 4,00,000 distributors and stockiest has placed several demands in front of FMCG companies asking for equal treatment of all those engaged in the distribution of FMCG goods as well as seeking price parity. In its letter, AICPDF has sought one pricing and scheme pan-India—that it said will eliminate cross border flow of goods that occurs when goods are being sold at cheaper rates in different markets. It has also asked FMCG companies to “rework margins"" to take into account any incremental costs borne on account of inflation. “We are authorized channel partners of your company in our designated area. We have earned reputation and goodwill amongst our retailers by giving them good service for many years. We understand that Jiomart and other B2B companies are offering them the same products of your company at a lesser price than what we offer them and this is adversely affecting our reputation and goodwill. Hence, our demand is that we also receive those products at prices at which we also can offer the same prices as Jiomart and B2B companies,"" it said. Distributors of large fast-moving consumer goods companies have for years dominated how products reach retailers and consumers. Lately, they have been at loggerheads with consumer products companies as new-age companies offer better prices and technology backbone to retailers potentially threatening their trade. AICPDF has urged FMCG companies to ensure that no preferential treatment is given to any enterprise irrespective of its volumes. If a company is unable to provide such pricing parity, the association said it will “drop"" the products sold by Jiomart and B2B companies from its portfolio. In its letter seeking favourable terms from companies—members of AICPDF said they will sale of new products till they get a guarantee from the company that such products will not be made available on Jiomart and other business to business companies in the future. It has appealed to companies to call for a meeting with their respective distributors as well as representatives of AICPDF to discuss and “sort out the matter"". Moreover, it has sought tighter monitoring on the flow of goods seeking the formation of a draft committee as well as setting up a regulatory body with various industry stakeholders to address future issues."
Updated: 12 Nov 2021,"Increasing prices of your morning coffee, biscuits are troubling RBI. Here's why",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/increasing-prices-of-your-morning-coffee-biscuits-are-troubling-rbi-here-s-why-11636681467462.html,"A clutch of Indian companies have turned increasingly vocal about their inflation concerns, setting the stage for raising prices that could test the central bank’s resolve to keep borrowing costs lower for longer to support the economy. Companies from Hindustan Unilever Ltd., the Indian arm of Unilever Plc, to Nestle India Ltd. have pointed to profit-squeeze from higher input costs and supply chain strains, while the likes of Dabur India Ltd., a maker of packaged honey and hair oil, and Britannia Industries Ltd. have already passed on some of the increased costs to consumers. That could see India’s headline inflation snap a four-month slowing trend in October, with data due later Friday expected to show the print inching up to 4.4%, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Consumer prices are seen accelerating further as a higher base of comparison from a year ago fades. “There is no substitute for price increases in an environment like this,"" Varun Berry, managing director at Britannia, told analysts in a post-earnings call this month. “So we have actioned price increases."" While several central banks have responded to price pressures by raising interest rates, the Reserve Bank of India has stuck with its inflation-is-transitory narrative as it sees the headline number edging lower on higher food output after a bountiful monsoon.  The expected food price-led moderation in India’s inflation was cited by Governor Shaktikanta Das as reason enough to continue with the easy monetary policy to support what he called a “delicately poised"" economic recovery. The RBI’s rate-panel is scheduled to meet early next month to review policy settings. Although the central bank sees inflation ending at 5.3% for the year ending March 2022, well within its 2%-6% target range, economists see the headline number hiding persistent price pressures. “The year-on-year estimates of retail inflation mask the real inflationary undercurrent prevailing in the economy due to statistical base effect,"" said Jay Shankar, chief economist at Incred Capital in Mumbai. “Corporate results continue to underline the raw material inflation led hit on margins, and is likely to persist for a few more quarters due to the slack in the economy."" What Bloomberg Economics Say... “Given the prospect of inflation heating up again and the recovery gathering momentum, we see a risk that the RBI raises rates a bit sooner than our current expectations for a reverse repo rate hike in April 2022 followed by a policy repo rate increase in February 2023."" -- Abhishek Gupta, senior India economist Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration last week cut an excise levy on diesel and gasoline, with an aim to check inflationary pressures and allow the central bank more room to keep borrowing costs low. The move, according to economists including those at IDFC First Bank Ltd. and Yes Bank Ltd., would help lower consumer price inflation by 10 to 14 basis points. Still, a surge in pent-up demand from Indians emerging out of lockdowns could see businesses regain pricing power that could drive inflation faster. “A substantial rise in prices charged for the provision of services in India had no detrimental impact on demand,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. “That said, service providers were concerned that persistent inflationary pressures could deter growth in the coming year."" Those are among risks, which Incred’s Shankar said could turn the RBI hawkish sooner than currently being priced in by markets. “Regardless of near-term inflation prints, the market is focused on the spillover impact of rising global commodity prices and potential Fed QE tapering on India’s monetary policy,"" said Anubhuti Sahay, an economist at Standard Chartered Plc.

Updated: 01 Oct 2021,Britannia Industries to invest Rs340 crore in new plant in Uttar Pradesh,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/britannia-industries-to-invest-rs340-crore-in-new-plant-in-uttar-pradesh-11633085309518.html,"NEW DELHI: Packaged foods company Britannia Industries Ltd on Friday said it has commenced work on its greenfield manufacturing facility in Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh. The plant to be set up across 30 acre, at an investment of Rs340 crore, will have an annual production capacity of 1.25 lakh tonne. The company will make more of its flagship brands including Marie Gold, 5050, Good Day, Milk Bikis, Tiger Glucose and Rusk. This is Britannia’s first greenfield manufacturing facility in Uttar Pradesh. ""Uttar Pradesh is a large consumption market for us and this facility will help us meet the growing demand for bakery products in Uttar Pradesh, and will also create fairly large-scale employment opportunities,"" Varun Berry, managing director, Britannia Industries, said in a statement. Britannia has been augmenting capacity amid growing demand for its bakery products and packaged foods that it said merits investments. In October last year, Britannia had increased its planned investment for Tamil Nadu to ₹550 crore from ₹300 crore, over a period of seven years. In August this year, the company announced an investment of Rs94 crore to expand capacity at its manufacturing plant in Khordha, Odisha. The new capacities in Odisha will be operational by October 2022. In-home consumption of biscuits, cookies, noodles and snacks benefitted as India moved into strict lockdowns to help arrest the spread of the pandemic. Consumers are also likely to shift to more packaged foods and pick brands they trust in the aftermath of the pandemic. Large companies are therefore accelerating product launches and reach. Work on the new manufacturing facility in Uttar Pradesh will commence in October and commercial production will begin in 15 months. The proposed facility will source key input materials such as wheat flour, sugar, and other ingredients locally thereby supporting a cross-section of the farming community in the state."
Updated: 24 Aug 2021,Consumer staples cos put up a resilient show in June quarter,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/consumer-staples-cos-put-up-a-resilient-show-in-june-quarter-11629743351689.html,"Indian consumer staples companies put up a good show for the quarter ended June on the revenue front. A favourable base helped, as the relatively stringent pandemic restrictions last year had weighed heavily on demand in Q1FY21. Companies also used their learnings from the previous year’s lockdown to minimize disruptions in production and supply chain this time around. What’s more, rural demand was strong despite being adversely impacted. A combination of these factors boosted their revenue growth. “Staples pack revenues grew 16% yoy (organic) and +7% on a two-year CAGR basis,"" Kotak Institutional Equities analysts said in a report on 20 August. CAGR is compounded annual growth rate. According to the broker, this growth was led by Britannia Industries Ltd, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL), Jyothy Labs Ltd, Dabur India Ltd and Marico Ltd, registering +12.3%, 11%, 11.5%, 7.2% and 8% two-year CAGR, respectively. Note that Britannia’s Q1FY22 operating revenues exceeded analysts’ estimates, even though the tailwinds from the pandemic were not expected to be as high as last year’s. GCPL’s home care segment did well, with the household insecticides portfolio putting up a strong show. India’s largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firm, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), marginally missed some analysts’ expectations on revenue, posting nearly 13% year-on-year growth in standalone revenues. Within the segments, HUL’s home care business performed well, helped by double-digit growth in fabric wash. For the sector, higher input costs played spoilsport on margins. “Raw material inflation was more than expected for the second consecutive quarter,"" wrote analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 13 August. “Coverage (universe) gross margin (excluding ITC, Varun Beverages) contracted 220 basis points (bps) quarter-on-quarter (versus our estimate of 40bps decline) to 49.6%, lowest in at least five years. This follows a 1.6 percentage point quarter-on-quarter moderation already seen in the last quarter,"" they added. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Here, GCPL and Marico’s sequential gross margin declines were higher at 370bps and 310bps, respectively. Needless to say, to cope with higher costs, many firms have taken calibrated price hikes across categories in the past few months. With the second wave ebbing, investors can anticipate a good recovery in Q2FY22. While that augurs well, it’s worth noting that valuations of consumer staples’ firms don’t offer scope for meaningful upsides hereon. On Monday, shares of HUL, GCPL and Dabur touched new 52-week highs on the NSE. Based on Bloomberg data, HUL stock trades at 57 times estimated earnings for FY23. This measure for Marico, Britannia, GCPL and Dabur stocks stands at 44 times, 45 times, 46 times and 49 times, respectively. As such, valuations are not cheap."

On the other hand, discretionary portfolios and summer consumption have been negatively impacted,"" the brokerage said in a report on the consumer staples sector This is especially true for packaged food companies as consumers bought more biscuits, edible oils, snacks, and frozen foods for in-home consumption. Britannia Industries, Tata Consumer and ITC’s FMCG segment, which has a strong in-home consumption portfolio, evinced good response, boosting volumes and therefore revenues. GCPL also saw a similar effect due to its household insecticide, personal care and hygiene portfolios, it said. Revenue growth was also aided by price hikes taken by several large companies over the last two quarter as commodity pressures remained high. Companies selling soaps, packaged tea, edible oil, snacks etc took prices hikes in March and June quarters. “Revenue and volume growth over two years were shaped mostly by portfolio mix, and relevant and activations riding evolving consumer trends. Revenue growth has benefited from pricing action as most companies took some pricing action to combat inflation,"" the brokerage added. Meanwhile, discretionary goods such as personal care products are yet to fully recover. For instance, ITC’s cigarettes volumes fell 18% on a two-year basis. Bajaj also performed poorly due to discretionary nature of its portfolio. Several companies diversified their portfolio, launching surface cleaners and disinfectants as demand for such products surged. “Companies which were quick to launch products and activations based on consumer trends like rising concern for health, safety and immunity driven by pandemic saw increased revenue traction,"" the report added."

Updated: 07 May 2021,Tata Consumer's shares fall 5% post muted Q4; but valuations still pricey,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/tata-consumer-s-shares-fall-5-post-muted-q4-but-valuations-still-pricey-11620368469201.html,"MUMBAI : Tata Consumer Products Ltd’s (TCPL's) shares have had investors’ love for some time now. In calendar year 2020, the shares had appreciated as much as 84% on the National Stock Exchange, easily making it one of the best performing consumer stocks in the country. After the sharp re-rating, 2021 has begun on a relatively slow note with the shares gaining around 5% so far. This is after accounting for nearly a 5% drop in early deals on Friday, after the company’s March quarter financial results disappointed the Street. Consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) declined by 2.6% over the same period last year to Rs300 crore vis-à-vis Bloomberg consensus estimates of Rs353 crore. Ebitda margins contracted by 294 basis points year-on-year to 9.9%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. True, margins were expected to take a hit considering the extraordinarily sharp spike in tea prices. Even so, margin is lower than expectations. Tata Consumer said, “Consolidated Ebitda growth for the quarter was impacted by tea inflation in India and increased A&P investments, which more than offset the strong Ebitda growth in India food and international business."" A&P refers to advertising and promotion expenses. Even so, JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd’s analysts point out, there are two aspects in the March quarter report that merit attention and monitoring. One, Sampann portfolio grew just 2% during the quarter. Tata Consumer has said the volatility in the pulses market has impacted growth. According to JM Financial, a business that is all of Rs400 crore in size per year should not have been impacted so badly by such macro events. It is also worth noting that the salt revenues saw robust growth in the March quarter, boosting the company’s India foods segments. Two, the international beverages business was especially weak. “While there is some high-base effect here due to pantry-loading in March quarter last year, the imputed 'normalized' growth rate seems to remind us that these are businesses that would continue to exhibit low-growth characteristics over the medium-term, once low-hanging fruits therein are plucked."" Overall, Tata Consumer’s revenues grew by 26% year-on-year to Rs3,037 crore. Weaker operating profit meant pre-tax and exceptional item earnings grew at a much slower pace of 5.8%. Meanwhile, the sharp appreciation in Tata Consumer’s shares since 2020 has understandably increased its valuations. As things stand, the Tata Consumer shares are higher than peer Britannia Industries Ltd’s. For perspective: Tata Consumer stock trades at 49 times financial year 2022 estimated earnings, based on Bloomberg data. The same parameter for Britannia stands at 45 times. As such, Tata Consumer’s high valuations could well limit upsides hereon."

Investors are discouraged by the packaged foods company’s profit margin performance in the quarter ended March. While Britannia’s consolidated gross profit margin expanded by 80 basis points on a year-on-year basis to 40.5%, the measure has declined by 262 basis points vis-à-vis the December quarter. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Britannia has said that on the commodity cost front, palm oil, packing material and dairy products witnessed sudden and steep increases.  But it’s not as if the margin outlook is bright, going ahead. Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a report on 28 April: “We also lower our margin estimates given rising input cost pressures and delayed pricing actions due to a weak demand environment. We see gross margins contracting in H1FY22 and normalizing in H2."" Besides, higher advertising spends are also likely to weigh on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin performance. For the March quarter, Ebitda margin increased by 30 basis points to 16.1% compared to the corresponding period last year. Other expenses increased at a faster rate, capping Ebitda margin expansion. To be sure, Britannia’s revenue performance was satisfactory in the March quarter with operating revenues increasing by 8.2% year-on-year to ₹3,038 crore. Having said that, the base for the current quarter is high considering that in the June 2020 quarter, revenues had increased as much as 26.4% year-on-year. Britannia had benefited from the increase in at-home consumption during last year’s covid-19 lockdown. But the firm is unlikely to gain in a similar manner during the second covid-19 wave. In fact, analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a report on 27 April: “With the onset of the second covid wave, biscuit category is seeing some tailwinds due to pantry stocking. However, unlike last year, there has not been a major supply disruption and, hence, Britannia would not have the benefit of lower competition."" As such, the above mentioned factors are expected to keep sentiments muted for the Britannia stock in the coming days. The shares trade at nearly 45 times estimated earnings for financial year 2022, according to Bloomberg data."

This could lead to a rise in hiring by up to 25% this year, said temporary staffing firms. “There's definitely an uptick in hiring, specifically for the frontline people,"" said Balasubramanian A, business head, clients, TeamLease Services. Also Read | India should worry about its public debt Large consumer goods companies typically work with thousands of distributors across the country and each distributor further has a posse of sales staff. Expansion for most fast-moving consumer goods companies happens on the back of a new distributor or a super stockist—that works in a certain territory and ensures access of products to various retailers in the area, said Balasubramanian. Rural markets have become an engine of growth for large packaged goods companies including Hindustan Unilever, Marico and Dabur among others, over the last three quarters, as parts of urban markets are still reporting muted growth. India’s villages that constitute 36% of sales for FMCG firms, were in a slump in 2019. These markets, however, reported strong growth in the first quarter of the current financial year helped by reverse migration, favourable government schemes and normal monsoon last year. Reverse migration has also helped move consumption trends to India’s smaller cities helping in brisk sale of packaged goods, Balasubramanian said. As a result, for most companies, rural demand continues to march ahead of urban. Jyothy Labs said sales in rural markets grew upwards of 15% in December quarter, while urban markets reported 7-8% growth. Marico Limited, on the other hand, reported a 24% growth in rural volumes in general trade in the December quarter. The company has added more stockists in India’s villages. Its rural distribution could go up 20% over the next few years, said Sanjay Mishra, chief operating officer, India sales and chief executive officer, new business, Marico Limited. “For Marico, rural has been a growth engine for the last 2-3 years, which has been further accelerated in the past 12 months. In Q3FY21 alone, general trade has witnessed a 24% growth in volume terms in the rural market,"" he said. Further, Marico's continued focus on expanding direct distribution enabled the company to develop a wide network of stockists in the rural market. ""We have added 30% new stockists over the last two years. This growth has been driven through different go-to-market models such as super distributors, including stockists as well as ready-stock van units. Going forward, we will also experiment with various different models to penetrate deeper into the rural markets, with an aim to grow the network by 20% in the next couple of years,"" said Mishra. Biscuit maker Britannia Industries added more distributors in rural markets after the lockdown-led disruptions impacted trade. The company has been steadily growing its access in rural areas. Between March 2020 and December 2020, the number of rural preferred dealers, as the company calls them, were up from 19,000 to 23,000. “….our rural distribution is solid, we've again put on more distributors in rural areas. I think during the covid period, there was irregularity of service from our distributors because of obvious reasons. But now, we've brought the discipline back into place, we made sure that supervision is happening, and execution is happening as per the norms set by us, and we are now back to a very solid 23,000 rural distributors,"" Varun Berry, MD, Britannia Industries said during the company’s post-earnings call this week. Packaged foods company Capital Foods said it is stepping up last-mile delivery by partnering with stockists and distributors in focused regions as demand for its Schezwan Chutney, Ching's Hakka Noodles, sauces, etc grew across the country, including in tier 2 and 3 markets in the last year. “Following which there has been a strategic focus on expanding production capacity by adding manufacturing units and strengthening our distribution network across India,"" said Navin Tewari, MD and CEO, Capital Foods Pvt. Ltd. Snacking company Prataap Snacks recovered 96% of business in the December quarter on the back of better rural reach. “We have almost caught up with last year. That is primarily because we have penetrated deeper in smaller towns and rural"" said Subhashish Basu, chief operating officer at the Indore-based company. Basu said urban centres remain weak due to restrictions on colleges and schools. The company is further deepening reach in rural pockets. “It will help us to create some cushion for the shortfalls we're getting from the top urban centers,"" said Basu."

State Bank of India: Reported a 6.9% year-on-year decline in its December quarter net profit to Rs5,1996 crore, as it made higher provisions for bad loans. Profit, however, topped the ₹4,850.5 crore average estimate of 15 analysts polled by Bloomberg. The lender lowered the guidance for FY21 credit growth to 7% from 8-9% announced it November. Reliance Industries: Has agreed to sell its entire stake in certain upstream assets in the Marcellus shale gas asset in south-western Pennsylvania in the US for $250 million amid a weakness in the global hydrocarbon market. The assets, controlled by RIL’s wholly-owned unit Reliance Marcellus LLC and operated by affiliates of EQT Corporation, will be sold to Northern Oil and Gas Inc. M&M: Will likely report double-digit growth in revenue and net profit for the December quarter, on the back of a robust increase in demand for its tractors and gradual recovery in passenger and commercial vehicle segment. A rise in input cost though could impact operating margins on a sequential basis. Bharti Airtel: Will raise up to ₹7,500 crore through debt instruments such as debentures and bonds in one or more tranches. The fundraising has been announced as the telecom companies prepare for the upcoming spectrum auction in March and the proposed rollout of 5G wireless service later this year. HCL Technologies: Has signed a five-year digital workplace services agreement with Airbus. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. As part of this, HCL will create a modernized digital workplace to enhance the user experience and service quality for a majority of Airbus employees globally. HPCL: State-run Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd reported an over three-fold rise in net profit to ₹2,355 crore for the December quarter against a net profit of ₹747 crore in the year-ago period. Revenue from operations, however, declined 2% year-on-year from ₹70,042.2 crore, but beat estimates. Private Banks: The 10 largest private sector banks in India have bad loans worth over ₹42,000 crore that are yet to be classified due to a court-ordered asset quality standstill, as per data compiled by Mint. While lenders have set aside ample provisions under the Reserve Bank of India’s guidelines, the loans, once classified, will add to the existing burden of NPAs on their books. FMCG stocks: As consumers in India’s top cities spend more time shopping for groceries online, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) makers are accelerating the launch of digital-first brands and rolling out more online specific stock keeping units. From organic honey and male grooming kits, to beverages and snacks, companies such as Marico Ltd, Dabur India Ltd and Hector Beverages are eyeing new launches. Biocon: The company has signed an agreement with Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) to expand access to lifesaving cancer biosimilars in over 30 countries in Africa and Asia. Vedanta: The company's board has approved expansion of the Lanjigarh alumina refinery from 2 MTPA to 5 MTPA at a cost of ₹3,779 crore."
Updated: 03 Jan 2021,Kotak Securities' top 10 stock picks for January,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/kotak-securities-top-10-stock-picks-for-january-11609651298986.html,"2020 has turned out to be one of the most unpredictable year for everyone. Equity markets worldwide have gone through a roller coaster ride in this calendar year. Two defensive sectors namely BSE Healthcare (up 62%) and BSE IT (up 56%) gave exceptional returns in 2020. Recovery across risk assets supported mainly by easy monetary policy by global Central banks. Finally, we are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel with covid vaccines availability. Three sectors delivered negative returns in 2020 which are BSE Bankex (-2%), BSE Oil & Gas (-4%) and BSE Utilities (-1%). Analysts at Kotak Securities believe there are three key factors which will drive the markets in 2021 - i) Covid-vaccines wide availability and reopening of economies, ii) Dollar index movement and related FPI flows, iii) Oil price movement, iv) Inflation and interest rates movement and vi) Earnings trajectory. ""We see possibility of moderate earnings upgrade over the next few months. We expect Nifty-50 earnings to increase by 11%, due to base effect in FY21E, 28% in FY22E and 19% in FY23E. Notably, sharp earnings jump in FY22E will be supported by automobiles, banks, metals and telecom sector. Our updated free float EPS for Nifty-50 stands at ₹488 for FY21E, ₹628 for FY22E and Rs746 for FY23E. Moreover, last five years earnings CAGR of Nifty-50 is just 2.6% (i.e. FY16-20). On the low base, we expect Nifty-50 earnings CAGR for the period of FY20-23E to be ~18%. Top stock picks for January by the brokerage includes, Bajaj Auto, Bharti Airtel, Britannia Industries, Hindustan Zinc, ICICI Bank, Infosys, Kalpataru Power, Petronet LNG, State Bank of India and SBI Life Insurance."

Updated: 10 Nov 2020,India beverages biz helps Tata Consumer brew a good Sep quarter,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/india-beverages-business-helps-tata-consumer-brew-a-good-september-quarter-11605008908471.html,"Tea has been comforting Indians during the pandemic, or so it appears from Tata Consumer Products Ltd’s September-quarter results. The company, which is a beneficiary of the rise in at-home consumption, had seen consolidated revenue growth of 13% year-on-year during the June quarter. Growth has further improved to 18.5% in Q2 on the back of robust performance of domestic beverage segment, revenues from which grew by 32%. The segment saw better realizations driven by higher tea prices and volume (up 11%). On the other hand, revenue growth from Tata Consumer’s international beverage business was slower at 7%. Revenue in the company’s domestic food business grew at 13% in Q2, down from 19% in Q1. To be sure, packaged foods company Britannia Industries Ltd saw a sharp revenue growth deceleration to 11% in the September quarter from 26.4% in the June quarter. In this backdrop, Tata Consumer’s performance appears better. While improved tea realizations helped boost overall revenues, higher tea prices did pose a risk to the company’s profitability for the quarter. After all, average domestic tea prices were up about 65% year-on-year. But the company managed well, restricting its consolidated gross profit margin contraction to about 270 basis points. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. A relatively slower pace of growth in employee costs, advertisement and sales charges, and other expenses boosted earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin, which expanded by 95 basis points to 14.4%. Post the results announcement on Friday evening, Tata Consumer’s shares closed marginally higher on Monday on the NSE. But, recall that the stock has seen a massive rally already. Currently, the shares are around 25% higher than pre-covid highs in February. Analysts from JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said, “Strictly speaking, we find the stock overvalued at 45 times one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio, especially since one-third of its revenue are from slow-growth international developed markets and another 10% are non-branded."" In a report on 8 November, the analysts said, “For now, however, the stock price could stay strong given that upgrades were still made to earnings forecasts, which came by on the back of good growth momentum in the overall business and expectations of further margin gains from acquisition synergies."" In the near term, domestic tea inflation remains a headwind. “While we have gained market share in tea and salt, navigating the unprecedented inflation in raw tea prices will be critical,"" said the company. It also remains to be seen whether the double-digit volume growth in the domestic beverage segment last quarter sustains. Nevertheless, valuations suggest investors haven’t woken up to these concerns yet."

Hindustan Unilever Ltd, the country’s top FMCG company, said the share of online retail to its total sales volume is close to 6%, rising from 3% in 2019. E-commerce sales at Nestle India Ltd surged 97% in the September quarter, comprising 4% of its local business. Packaged foods company Britannia Industries also said that its e-commerce sales have grown very “aggressively"" in the September quarter even as modern trade sales have been slow to catch up. “E-commerce has been a growth accelerator for us. Today, e-commerce has actually doubled from where it was pre-covid. It’s a shade under 6% in terms of our business and the growth rates have also doubled,"" Srinivas Phatak, chief financial officer, Hindustan Unilever, said last week after HUL’s earnings call. The maker of Surf Excel detergent and Dove soaps has been beefing up its e-comme-rce capabilities over the years. India’s FMCG trade is still dominated by millions of traditional mom-and-pop stores, despite the latest surge in online retail. Online sales have a minuscule 3% share, market researcher Nielsen said in a September report. The share is, however, more in metros. Packaged beverage company Parle Agro said it has seen “unprecedented growth in the segment"" as the supply squeeze prompted consumers to place online orders. “A lot of people who resisted adopting e-commerce as a platform to buy from had no choice because of the supply situation, or the number of stores open or even because the fear of going out was so high. So, most people started depending on e-commerce,"" said Nadia Chauhan, joint managing director and chief marketing officer, Parle Agro, which sells Frooti and Appy Fizz beverages. The curbs put in place to contain the spread of coronavirus and consumer worries about venturing into physical stores is fuelling the growth of online retail, with a lot of people ordering goods online for the first time. For FMCG firms, personal care categories helped get new consumers online, according to Nielsen. “It’s a very profitable part of the business and every company is treating this as the most important vertical from a medium-to-long term perspective, because if you can grow your market share here, obviously your pan-India market share will improve as e-commerce grows. Though it is 2-5% for every FMCG company, in the long term it will be in double digits,"" said Abneesh Roy, senior vice-president, research, Edelweiss Securities."

Updated: 25 Aug 2020,Industry body seeks lower GST rates on packaged food products,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/industry-seeks-lower-gst-on-processed-foods-11598262949424.html,"New Delhi: Ahead of the GST Council meeting on 27 August, the All India Food Processors’ Association (AIFPA), an industry body that represents several large and regional packaged food companies, has written to the Ministry of Food Processing Industries as well as the finance minister asking for lower Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates to 5% from the current 12% on packaged food items such as chips, cereals, pickles, ready-to-eat foods, snacks and instant meals, among others. The AIFPA that represents some of the country’s largest packaged food companies, including Haldiram's, Prataap Snacks, ITC, Mondelez India, Britannia Industries, PepsiCo, Bikanerwala and MTR, has been seeking lower GST rates on packaged foods on a par with unbranded food items that could help expand the packaged and branded food market in India. “Non-branded namkeens, bhujias, fruit & vegetable chips, snack foods etc. are charged only 5% GST, while in the packaged form these items are charged 12% GST. This anomaly has been increasing complexities for the industry and encouraging production of unsafe & unhealthy products. It is further realised that a shift of consumption from branded to non-branded foods reduces revenue to the Government and proves to be counterproductive,"" All India Food Processors’ Association’s, president, Subodh Jindal, said in the letter, which has been reviewed by Mint. Currently, food accounts for 57% of sales contribution to the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry in India. AIFPA argued that consumer expenditure on the food basket is estimated in the range of 35% to 50% for most households. Covid has turned the spotlight on packaged food consumption in India, as consumers stuck at home owing to the pandemic bought more staples, snacks and ready-to-cook items benefiting companies like Parle Products, Britannia, ITC (FMCG business excluding cigarettes). The move could also help reduce agri-produce linked wastages, AIFPA has said. “An important step for increasing farmer’s income is to increase the consumption of agri-produce by promoting the use of consumer food products,"" the letter added. It added that daily use food items attract a higher GST of 12% on food preparation from fruits, vegetables, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, milk and cereals besides spices, pickles, chutneys, namkeens and ready-to-eat foods. The ask comes at a time when companies also faced several supply-side disruptions such as interruptions in manufacturing and movement of goods in the months of March and April that effectively dented their sales. In a separate recommendation, The Indian Beverage Association (IBA) also sought lower tax on aerated beverages ahead of the GST council meeting. IBA that represents several large companies including PepsiCo, Coca Cola, Dabur India and ITC has asked the government to stop levying compensation cess on aerated beverages by removing them from the ‘sin’ category, according to a news report in The Hindu Business Line on Monday. Moreover, it has also sought reduction of GST rate on juice-based beverages to 5% from 12%, while seeking reduction in GST rate on packaged water. AIFPA’s letter also urged the government not to include food processing items as “luxury products"" and tax it at par with other non-branded food products. “Food processing is not an option but an essential step in making natural agri-produce ready for human consumption. Even wheat, rice, corn, milk, potato, tomato, onion, sugar, salt, fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, pulses, spices, meat, fish etc. have to be processed to make them usable,"" the letter said. Drawing comparisons to global taxation rates on packaged foods, AIFPA’s letter said food products are either exempt from tax or chargeable at a minimal rate, in several markets globally. ""About 74% countries have 0% GST rate on food and in 92% countries the maximum GST rate on food is 10%,"" it said."
Updated: 30 Jul 2020,Mother Dairy forays into bread category,https://www.livemint.com/industry/retail/mother-dairy-forays-into-bread-category-11596098972139.html,"NEW DELHI: Cashing in on the growing trend of in-house snacking as Indians remain stuck at home due to covid-19, Mother Dairy, the wholly owned subsidiary of National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), has entered the bake category with the launch of bread. The diversified dairy brand which manufactures and sells milk and milk products such as ice creams, paneer and ghee, on Thursday announced the launch of a range of breads priced between ₹15 and ₹40. The breads will be available at its existing network of booths in Delhi-NCR. “Mother Dairy already offers milk, butter, cheese, curd and fruits. With bread, we also want to raise awareness about breakfast and how it is the most important meal of the day. It has been found that one out of four Indians in metro cities, skip breakfast, which could lead to chronic diseases,"" said Sangram Chaudhary, managing director at Mother Dairy Fruit & Vegetable Private Ltd. He said the newly introduced range also strengthens the company’s breakfast portfolio as a source of protein with low-fat content. With changing lifestyle and demand for convenience food, bread is gaining importance and finding a place in Indian households. The growth in the bread category has been further accelerated by the pandemic which has forced consumers to stay indoors, driving in-home food consumption. Although bread is a very local category owing to logistical and supply chain challenges, there are some large national firms in the fray. Britannia Industries, the maker of Gooday and Tiger biscuits, for instance also reported a spike in bread sales during covid-induced lockdown. Speaking to Mint, the company’s managing director Varun Berry said for the company bread and cheese saw the highest growth during the period followed by rusks and biscuits. For Mother Dairy, which also sells edible oils under Dhara and fresh fruits and vegetables and frozen vegetables under Safal brand, the bread launch comes close on the heels of the launch of Haldi Milk."
