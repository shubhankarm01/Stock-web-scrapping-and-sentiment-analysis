Updated: 30 Apr 2022,"Power cuts continue in UP, Punjab, other states amid coal crunch, heatwaves",https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/power-cuts-continue-in-up-punjab-other-states-amid-coal-crunch-heatwaves-11651278452033.html,"Several Indian states faced power cuts for up to 10 hours in the past two days amid coal shortages and increased temperature. According to a report by the Hindustan Times, Livemint's sister publication, 100 out of the 165 operational coal plants in the country are running at a ""critical level"" of stocks. The current power crisis highlights the strained finances of the country's power sector where many firms have run out of money to pay for replenishment or buy from the grid, or have not placed an order on time. The power generation companies are also reluctant in purchasing more expensive coal imports. Power officials also said more electricity is available on the grid but some states preferred load shedding over paying extra. The blackouts are also the outcome of an unrelenting surge in power demand due to heatwave, compounded by a lack of freight train wagons that carry coal from mines to plants. Consequently, states such as Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan have opted for 8-10 hours of unscheduled power cuts, mostly in smaller towns and rural areas. Data from Power System Operation Corporation (Posoco) showed that India’s power demand hit a new record of 207,000 MW on April 28. On the other hand, the Union Power Ministry has said that firms in states are resorting to load-shedding for cost cutting. Yesterday, power secretary Alok Kumar said that there was still up to 5,000 MW of power available in the Central pool, but no state has placed any request so far. Further, the temperature touching 47 degrees in some parts of the country has led to increased power demand. In April, which is set to be one of the hottest since 1951, the power demand has risen by 50% in states such as Punjab. India's overall electricity demand has risen by around 10% as compared to last year. Yesterday, Union Power Minister RK Singh said that power outages are due primarily because states have not paid their dues to Coal India and are unable to lift allocated coal on time."
Updated: 19 Apr 2022,"Crisis-hit Sri Lanka, India revive talks to link electric grids: Report",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/crisishit-sri-lanka-india-revive-talks-to-link-electric-grids-report-11650368873468.html,"COLOMBO : India and Sri Lanka have resumed talks on linking their electricity grids, officials told Reuters on Tuesday, a step that could aid New Delhi's goal of reducing China's influence on the island nation, now grappling with a severe economic crisis. There was no immediate prospect that power cuts brought by the crisis could be eased by the talks, which are a preliminary effort on a multi-year project both sides have explored before. India has extended assistance running into billions of dollars to its southern neighbour to fight the crisis, brought on by a steep drop in foreign exchange reserves that stalled imports of essentials such as fuel, so disrupting power supply. ""It is at very initial stages of discussion,"" Wasantha Perera, secretary of Sri Lanka's power ministry, told Reuters, but gave no further details. Protests and political turmoil brought on by rocketing inflation, a currency devaluation and shortages have spurred the nation of 22 million to begin talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a loan programme, also backed by India. Now officials of both countries are turning to a project that has made little progress since it was first proposed more than a decade ago, aiming to link the neighbours with a miles-long transmission line running under the Indian Ocean. The grid connection project came up in talks with India's power ministry in March, when Basil Rajapaksa, then Sri Lanka's finance minister, visited New Delhi to seek assistance, said a source with knowledge of the matter. ""It will be mutually beneficial,"" added the source, who sought anonymity, as the talks were private. The foreign ministries of both India and Sri Lanka did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The project figured among the key objectives of a strategy paper issued by Sri Lanka's diplomatic mission in India last July. ""This would enable Sri Lanka to obtain electricity during operational maintenance and droughts, and also to export excess generation to India,"" it said in the document. Nearly two-thirds of Sri Lanka's electricity is generated by oil and coal-fired plants, while hydro makes up the rest. Its total daily power demand is just a fraction of India's, and meeting peak demand can be a challenge during times of drought. Vying for influence Beijing and New Delhi have long vied for influence over the island, strategically located just off India's southern tip, and Indian assistance in recent weeks has swelled amid a worsening crisis that has brought thousands on the streets. The grid connectivity project could become part of New Delhi's requests from Sri Lanka, which has also secured Chinese infrastructure deals in recent years, a source with knowledge of India's thinking told Reuters, on condition of anonymity. Until now, India has provided aid amounting to about $1.9 billion through credit lines and swaps, and is ready to commit up to $2 billion more to help Sri Lanka tackle its worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948. The plan to link the two grids has been in the works for years, with the neighbours signing a pact in 2010 on feasibility studies for an undersea power cable. A study by the Power Grid Corporation of India envisaged deployment of either a 500-megawatt (MW) or a 1,000-MW undersea transmission system, the state-run company said in an annual report in 2015. The shortest distance separating India and Sri Lanka is a narrow strip of ocean called the Palk Strait, which is about 40 kilometres (24.85 miles) wide, though the length of an undersea cable would depend on its alignment. Subsea electrical cables with long spans include the NordLink, between Germany and Norway, which is about 623 km (387 miles) long."
Updated: 02 Mar 2022,Super 15: Stocks benefitting from rising popularity of ESG theme ,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/super-15-stock-benefitting-from-rising-popularity-of-esg-theme-11646195130371.html,"In a post-Covid world, conscious investing has gained lot of traction among investors. In fact, in 2021, at a global platform, India made a commitment to reach net carbon zero by 2070. With the environment, social and governance (ESG) theme fast catching-up, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd have outlined key considerations for investors and picked stocks from five sectors to bet on this theme. They are as follows: 1) Coal Sector: The fundamental question for India's transition is linked to its coal sector. Ensuring a well-planned and just transition away from coal will be a significant challenge, with both risks and opportunities in the power sector and beyond. With around 8% of state revenue from coal activities, diversification of the economy is needed. Coal India Ltd will be central to the transition. The company has already taken steps to diversify into renewable power, with three gigawatts of planned solar capacity to FY24. Natural gas is also set to play a significant role in displacing coal. GAIL India Ltd operates around 220 mmsmd (million metric standard cubic meter per day) of pipeline capacity and is the largest LNG trader in India. 2) Agriculture accounts for around 20% of India's greenhouse gas emissions and is the main source of non-carbon dioxide related emissions. Opportunities exist for investors through chemical free farming and low-cost solutions which improve irrigation and energy efficiency. UPL Ltd will likely play a central role in decarbonisation efforts. Through various projects, it is driving the adoption of digital solutions and increased penetration of bio-solutions. 3) Road Transport: With auto demand set to grow to 2040, an uptake in electric power-trains is an important area of focus for policy-makers. Tata Motors Ltd leads the local market with nearly 7% market share. Bajaj Auto Ltd, TVS Motor Company Ltd & Hero MotoCorp Ltd are actively expanding their electric vehicles portfolios. 4) Power Utilities: State-run distribution companies will underpin India's energy transition. Their financial fragility however currently inhibits their appetite for investment and transformation of the power grid. NTPC Ltd should be a key beneficiary of new renewable capacity given its access to low cost funding. Power Grid Corporation of India, Larsen & Toubro Ltd, Siemens Ltd and KEI International Ltd could all see tailwinds from increased transmission and distribution spend. 5) Heavy Industry: Heavy industry's share of energy consumption has increased to 42%, making it the largest end user of energy. Incumbents are focused on renewable power with Shree Cement Ltd, The Ramco Cements Ltd and Ultratech Cement Ltd all active in this regard."

On Monday, the BSE Sensex ended at 54,402.85, up 125.13 points or 0.23%. The Nifty was at 16,258.25, up 20.05 points or 0.12%. Asian stocks started off on a weak footing on Tuesday after a largely soft performance on Wall Street and as persistent concerns over the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus dented sentiment and triggered falls in metals and oil prices. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan declined 0.4% in early trading, with Korea’s Kospi index down 0.56% while China’s blue chip index CSI300 shed 0.33%. Japan’s Nikkei was UP 0.9% while Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX200 was 0.2% higher on the back of strong earnings results. Among key companies Power Grid Corporation, Zomato, Coal India, Siemens, Motherson Sumi Systems, Lupin, Jindal Steel & Power, Max Financial Services, Trent, Max Healthcare Institute, Whirlpool of India, Manappuram Finance and Computer Age Management Services will announce June quarter earnings today.

Domestic air passenger traffic rose steeply for the second consecutive week, as a fall in covid-19 cases, lower fares, and the easing of curbs by most states encouraged more people to take to the skies. Average number of daily fliers rose to 227,000 in the week ended 7 August from 165,000 a week before, broking firm ICICI Securities said in a report on Monday. Oil prices were recovering on Tuesday after falling as much as 4% in the previous session, which extended last week’s steep losses amid a rising US dollar and concerns that new coronavirus-related restrictions in China could slow a global revival in fuel demand. US crude oil futures were trading at $66.82 per barrel, up $0.35 or 0.53%. Brent crude was at $69.29, up $0.25 or 0.36% higher. Gold stabilised after falling to a more than four-month low on Monday as strong US jobs data bolstered expectations for an early tapering of the Federal Reserve’s economic support measures. Spot gold was fetching $1,732.13 an ounce, up 0.16%. The strong jobs data lifted US Treasury yields. Benchmark 10-year notes were last yielding 1.3237%, up from 1.3170% on Monday. US stock indexes were mostly soft, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.3%, the S&P 500 off 0.09% while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.16%.

Investors were still assessing whether Friday’s strong US payrolls report would take the Fed a step nearer to winding back its stimulus. However, the pace of tapering was still up in the air and would decide when an actual rate increase comes, he said. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion of assets a month. The spread of the Delta variant could argue for a longer taper. In the currency markets, the dollar index moved 0.02% higher, with the euro off 0.03% to $1.1732, its lowest since early April. The dollar held firm against the yen at 110.38 yen, near its highest level in about two weeks. The US currency’s broad rally came as US Treasury yields spiked to three-week highs on the back of the strong jobs data and early Fed taper speculation. (Reuters contributed to the story)"
