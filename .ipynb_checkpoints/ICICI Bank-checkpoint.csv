This had an effect on the retail loan segment, prompting both new and current loan borrowers to pay higher EMIs. Home loans are now more expensive as a result of the benchmark interest rate increase, and the rates are often significantly higher for borrowers without salaries or those with credit scores below 750. Repo Linked Loan Rate (RLLR) and Marginal Cost of Fund Based Lending Rate (MCLR) hikes are still in progress even after a month of MPC meetings. As a consequence, it is difficult to get a home loan with cheap interest rates currently. However, let's examine the home loan rates being provided by the largest lenders in our nation.  Bank of Baroda (BoB) accepts applications for home loans from Indian residents who are at least 21 years old. Additionally, eligible are non-resident Indians (NRIs) with Indian passports, persons of Indian origin (PIOs) with foreign passports, and overseas citizens of India (OCI). The bank has set a maximum age restriction of 70 years for borrowers who want to get loans, and the maximum loan term is 30 years. The effective interest rate on home loans for non-staff members ranges from 7.45 per cent to 8.80 per cent. While the interest rate that applies to staff members (Public Scheme) is 7.45 per cent.  The minimum interest rate for home loans was raised to 7.55 per cent on June 15, 2022, by SBI, the largest lender in our nation. On the bank's website, it is stated that the lender has also raised its External Benchmark-based Lending Rate (EBLR) from 7.05 per cent to a minimum of 7.55 per cent. With effect from June 15, 2022, SBI has increased the benchmark one-year MCLR rate from 7.20 per cent to 7.40 per cent and updated the marginal cost of fund-based lending rates (MCLR) by up to 0.20 per cent.  Home loans with reasonable interest rates are available from ICICI Bank for terms of up to 30 years. Through ICICI Bank Express Home Loan, a self-service digital platform for current as well as non-ICICI Bank customers, borrowers can obtain digital approval for a home loan. With effect from June 8, 2022, ICICI Bank updated its External Benchmark Lending Rate (EBLR). ""ICICI Bank External Benchmark Lending Rate"" (I-EBLR) is referenced to RBI Policy Repo Rate with a mark-up over Repo Rate. I-EBLR is 8.60% p.a.p.m. effective June 8, 2022,"" the bank has mentioned on its website.  The marginal cost of lending rate, or MCLR, has been raised by the HDFC Bank across all tenors, and the new MCLR rates are effective as of Thursday, July 7. The overnight, one-month, and three-month HDFC Bank MCLR rates were increased by 20 basis points to 7.70%, 7.75%, and 7.80%, respectively. The HDFC Bank MCLR rates have increased by 20 bps to 7.90% and 8.05%, respectively, for tenures of six months and one year. The MCLR for HDFC Bank has increased by 20 bps to 8.15 per cent and 8.25 per cent for terms of two and three years, respectively.

Home loans from Axis Bank start at Rs. 3,00,000 and include a number of benefits including longer-term, appealing interest rates, a simple application procedure, doorstep service, etc. No prepayment fees as well as floating and fixed interest rates are permitted by Axis Bank for home loans. The bank provides a floating rate of 7.60 per cent to 7.95 per cent per year for salaried individuals and a fixed rate of 12 per cent for home loans. The floating rate for individuals who are self-employed ranges from 7.70 per cent to 8.05 per cent annually. and the current fixed rate for loans is 12 per cent."

According to Trading Economics data, the 10-year yield of g-secs is around 7.45 %, while the 5-year yield is at 7.26% on June 30. In line with Shyamala Gopinath Committee recommendations to ensure small savings schemes are market-linked, the Finance Ministry in March 2016, had announced instead of annual resetting of small savings schemes' interest rates for the next financial year, the interest rates from now on will be reset every quarter based on the G-Sec yields of the previous three months. In 2011, the Gopinath committee had recommended keeping small savings interest rates higher by 25-100 basis points from the average yields of government securities. With the small savings schemes' interest rates kept unchanged, are they attractive compared to bank deposits that have witnessed massive hikes in their interest rates since RBI started to hike repo rate?. Since May this year, RBI has hiked the repo rate by 90 basis points - taking the rate to 4.90%. Here is the list of interest rates offered by major banks on their fixed deposits. SBI: From June 14, SBI is offering a 5.30% interest rate to regular customers on 1 year to less than 2 years tenure. The rate is 5.80% for senior citizens on the same tenure.

This is the ninth quarter in a row that small savings interest rates have not changed. The interest rate on small savings schemes has not been revised since the first quarter of 2020-21. New investments made during the second quarter of FY 2022-23 into these schemes will also earn the same interest rates as in the previous quarter. The PPF will continue to earn 7.10%. The Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS) will continue to earn 7.40%, and post office time deposits will fetch 5.5-6.7%, the Finance Ministry said. Interest rates on small savings schemes are reset on a quarterly basis, in line with the movement in benchmark government bonds of similar maturity. During the last quarter, the government had decided to maintain the status quo. The Shyamala Gopinath committee in 2011 had recommended to make small savings scheme market linked.  Analysts had indicated a possibility of the interest rates being raised this time given the increase in G-Sec yields over the last quarter. As of today, India 10-year Bond yield was at 7.424%, compared with 6.843% on 31 March. Notably, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also raised the policy interest rate by 90 basis points during the April-June quarter. Amid rising inflation, the government in March kept interest rates unchanged for small savings schemes, including PPF and NSC, for the first quarter of 2022-23. PPF and NSC will continue to carry an annual interest rate of 7.1% and 6.8%, respectively, in the first quarter of the next fiscal. ""The rate of interest on various small savings schemes for the first quarter of the financial year 2022-23, starting from April 1, 2022, and ending on June 30, 2022, shall remain unchanged from the current rates applicable for the fourth quarter (January 1, 2022, to March 31, 2022) for FY 2021-22,"" the finance ministry had said in a notification earlier. The one-year term deposit scheme will continue to earn an interest rate of 5.5% in the first quarter of the next fiscal while the girl child savings scheme Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana will fetch 7.6%. It is to be noted that the country's biggest lender State Bank of India (SBI) offers 5% interest rate on one-year fixed deposit. The interest rate on the five-year senior citizens' savings scheme will be retained at 7.4%. The interest on the senior citizens' scheme is paid on a quarterly basis. The interest rate on savings deposits will continue to be at 4% per annum. Term deposits of one to five years will fetch an interest rate in the range of 5.5-6.7%, to be paid quarterly while the interest rate on five-year recurring deposits will earn a higher interest of 5.8%. Recently, the Provident Fund (PF) rate was reduced to a four-decade low of 8.1% for 2021-22 from 8.5%. Defending the proposal to cut interest rate paid on employees' provident fund deposits, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, earlier this month, said the rate is dictated by today's realities where interest rate on other small saving instruments was even lower. FM Sitharaman had also cited the comparative prevailing interest rates of other schemes saying Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana offers 7.6%, Senior Citizen saving scheme (7.4%) and PPF (7.1%) while SBI's 5-10 year fixed deposits gives 5.50%."

We seem to be nearing a trough in the asset-quality cycle and provisioning levels appear demonstrably sufficient. Capitalisation for sector-leading large private banks is more than adequate in our view,"" it said in a note on Indian banks. BNP Paribas thinks deposit flows have entrenched a lot of cost-stability advantages that larger banks enjoy. Valuations, while not a bargain, are not in the highest reaches of trading bands either. BNP Paribas' top stock picks - HDFC Bank: The global brokerage believes recent headwinds on tech investment news flow create a special opportunity in HDFC Bank as its traditional strengths (CASA tailwinds, best-in-class asset quality) are being somewhat discounted. Its Buy tag on HDFC Bank shares comes with a target price of ₹1,710. ICICI Bank: ICICI Bank remains a play on credit revival with high provisioning levels, tech investments and continued CASA mobilization, it said with target price of ₹890.  Axis Bank: “We choose Axis Bank for the valuation headroom it offers as well as gearing to a credit cycle recovery through both asset quality and loan growth. Our comfort with AXSB’s provision levels is as high as what we have for ICICIBC’s but recognise that a lower CASA and higher cost of funds ensure that higher rates do not confer an equal amount of competitive benefits on it as on HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank,"" the note stated. The brokerage's Buy tag on the bank stock comes with a target price of ₹970. Further, BNP Paribas also has buy ratings on IndusInd Bank (TP: ₹1,030), AU Small Finance Bank (TP: ₹750) and State Bank of India (SBI) with price target at ₹500.

Updated: 27 Jun 2022,S&P affirms ICICI Bank's 'BBB-' rating on improved asset quality,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/sp-affirms-icici-bank-s-bbb-rating-on-improved-asset-quality-11656325311510.html,"Affirming ratings for ICICI Bank, global rating agency Standard and Poor’s (S&P) on Monday said the private sector lender is expected to sustain improvements in asset quality, backed by India's economic recovery and improved risk management. S&P has retained a 'stable' outlook on the rating reflecting the view that ICICI Bank will maintain its strong market position and good capitalisation over the next 12 to 18 months. It has 'BBB-' long-term rating on the private lender. This is despite an uneven economic recovery in the country and macroeconomic challenges. In a statement, S&P Global Ratings said, ""In our base case, the bank's weak loans, defined as nonperforming loans (NPLs) and restructured loans, will decline to 3-3.5 per cent of total loans over the next 12 months, from about 4.6 per cent as of March 31, 2022."" Broadly stable credit conditions will support this and credit costs should remain at about 1 per cent over the next 12-18 months, it said, adding the bank's asset quality should remain better than the Indian sector average and in line with international peers over the next two years. ""The bank's better customer profile and underwriting relative to the Indian banking sector will likely limit losses from the spillover impact of geopolitical tensions. Retail loans form about 53 per cent of the bank's loan portfolio,"" it stated. These are well diversified among home loans, vehicle loans, and unsecured loans, including personal loans and credit cards. The stable outlook reflects that ICICI Bank will maintain a strong market position in the Indian banking sector. The bank should maintain good capitalization over the next 12-18 months, supported by healthy earnings, it further said. An upgrade of ICICI Bank is unlikely over the next one to two years as an upgrade will require an improvement in the bank's financial profile as well as the credit rating on the country."

Ltd), a pan-India distributor for AMD, JBL, Nvidia, Dell, Lenovo, and Fitbit, is planning an initial pubic offering (IPO) to raise as much as ₹1,000 crore, two people aware of the development said. Founded by Krishna Choudhary and Suresh Pansari in 1989, RP Tech is one of India’s five largest IT distributors and service providers. The company works with more than 30 top global technology brands. It has a network of 50 branches and 50 service centres serving more than 9,000 dealers across the country. “RP Tech has hired investment banks JM Financial and ICICI Securities to advise it on the proposed IPO. Work on the draft red herring prospectus has already started. While the final contours of the deal are yet to be decided, it is expected that the company could raise as much as ₹1,000 crore, which will be a mix of primary and secondary share sale,"" one of the two people mentioned above said. Emails sent to RP Tech and its senior management on Friday remained unanswered. “While the company predominantly deals in personal computers, peripherals, and components, it has been adding new brands and product categories to its portfolio. The disruptions caused by covid has led to significant demand for IT hardware both from corporates and public, leading to a strong rise in revenue for distributors. Also, while the supply chain issues have led to price hikes, margins are protected, as any price hike is completely passed on to customers,"" said the second person mentioned above. For FY21, RP Tech reported a revenue of ₹5,865.59 crore, compared to a revenue of ₹3,918.42 crore in the previous fiscal. It reported a profit of ₹122.31 crore in FY21, jumping multi-fold from a profit of ₹42.16 crore in the last fiscal, as per a credit rating report from Crisil, dated 31 August, 2021. “RPPL (Rashi Peripharals Pvt Ltd) have a long-standing relationship with principals such as Lenovo, Asus, Hewlett-Packard, Sandisk, and Western Digital. RPPL also has made significant vendor additions in the recent past, including brands such as Samsung and LG. CRISIL Ratings believes that RPPL will further improve its business risk profile over the medium term, on the back of its established market position in the domestic IT hardware distribution business and continued healthy demand for its products,"" the rating agency noted in its report."

These stocks are hot picks",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/bear-days-are-numbered-build-quality-portfolio-in-markets-these-stocks-are-hot-picks-11656263787991.html,"Markets recovered last week as equity benchmarks snapped a two-week losing streak as investors took a breather from inflation concerns due to the downside in commodity prices. Going forward, markets will continue to witness volatility as bearish stick still lingers with current macroeconomic risks, however, the days are numbered. The selling pressure is expected to be short-lived and experts have advised investors to build quality stocks portfolio. On Friday, Sensex finished at 52,727.98 up by 462.26 points or 0.88%. Nifty 50 closed at 15,699.25 higher by 142.60 points or 0.92%. Both the benchmarks have gained nearly 3% each from June 20 to 24. During these days, investors' wealth on BSE climbed by ₹7,40,977.89 crore. BSE market cap stood at ₹234,86,923.67 crore on June 20 and jumped to ₹242,27,901.56 crore on June 24. Research Analysts - Dharmesh Shah, Nitin Kunte, CMT, Pabitro Mukherjee, and Vinayak Parmar at ICICI Securities in their technical note said, equity benchmarks behaved contrary to our expectations as downbeat global cues tracking anxiety around rising inflation globally, rate hikes weighed on investor sentiments. On Nifty 50, they said the velocity of the decline accelerated on breach of March low of 15700 and drifted further to the 15200 mark. Going forward, the analysts said, ""We expect the index to gradually resolve higher and extend pullback towards the 16600 regions in coming months wherein strong support is placed in the vicinity of 14800-14600 zone, which we expect to hold as it is 80% retracement of CY-21 rally (13596-18604), at 14600. Thus, dips should be utilised to construct a portfolio by accumulating quality stocks in a staggered manner."" ICICI Securities analysts' positive bias is based on four factors: 1. The reading of the percentage of stocks above 200 DMA below 15 signifies extreme pessimism in the markets that eventually leads to a technical pullback to the tune of a minimum of 10% in the subsequent three months. 2. Index has already corrected 18% from the life highs and has approached oversold reading on the weekly momentum oscillator. The weekly RSI has approached its lowest level (placed at 35) since May 2020. Historically, a reading of 35 on weekly RSI has produced a decent pullback, and the analysts expect this rhythm to maintain in the coming months. 3. India continues to relatively outperform the EM basket even in the ongoing corrective phase despite significant selling by FIIs. Over the past one year, while the MSCI EM index has corrected over 40% from highs, India has relatively outperformed as the benchmark corrected only 18%. 4. The India VIX and crude oil prices have cooled off from the recent swing high. Indian Equities have an inverse correlation with the India VIX. Thus, providing impetus for the acceleration of ongoing pullback. They added, ""On the broader market front, in three instances over the past decade, intermediate correction in the Nifty Midcap, Small cap indices have been to the tune of 28% and 40%, respectively. At present, both indices have corrected 25% and 34%, respectively."" Therefore, the analysts said, ""any further correction is likely to be short-lived amid oversold territory and would set the stage for a technical pullback in coming weeks."" Here are the top picks of ICICI Securities analysts: BFSI - SBI, HDFC, Kotak Bank, Federal Bank, and Bajaj Finance. Telecom & Technology - Reliance, TCS, Infosys, L&T Infotech, HCL Technology, and Coforge. Capital goods - L&T, ABB, Siemens, BEL, AIA Engineering, ELGI Equipment, Sanghvi Movers, and Timken India. Consumption - Hindustan Unilever, Titan, ITC, Asian Paints, Tata Consumer, Havells India, Jubilant Foods, and Astral Poly. Auto - M&M, Maruti Suzuki, Ashok Leyland, Jamna Auto, Mahindra CIE, FIEM Industries, and Minda Industries. Infra and Realty - DLF LTD, Brigade Enterprise, and Phoenix Mills. Pharma & Chemicals - Divi's Laboratories, Cipla, Syngene, Torrent Pharma, and SRF Ltd. Metal - JSW Steel, Hindalco, and Graphite. Others - Adani Port, Indian Hotels, Zee Entertainment, Trent, Concor, Nocil, Balrampur Chinni, BDL, Bluedart, Dixon Technologies, Kansai Nerolac, and NRB Bearing. Markets weekly outlook: For the week June 27 to July 1, ICICI Direct analysts expect Nifty to eventually resolve past falling channel placed at 15800 and gradually head towards 16200 levels in coming weeks. In expiry week, use dips towards 15400 to create long positions as the index is poised at extreme oversold readings. ICICI Direct analysts added that brent oil prices have breached the weekly rising trend line indicating a loss of momentum and ""we expect upsides to be capped in 125-130 zone."" According to ICICI Direct analysts, amongst sectors preferences, IT, and BFSI are key sectors with favourable risk/reward, while Auto and Capital goods are expected to extend outperformance. The analysts prefer - SBI, HDFC, Kotak Bank, TCS, Maruti Suzuki, ITC, and Titan in large caps while in midcaps we like KPIT Technologies, Federal Bank, AIA Engineering, NRB Bearings, Ashok Leyland, Automotive Axles, Bharat Electronics, Havells, Trent, and Indian Hotel. Yesha Shah, Head of Equity Research, Samco Securities said, ""The coming week has a host of events arriving which could affect the mood of the market. Globally, investors will keenly analyze the US quarterly GDP growth rate numbers. The USA would officially enter into a recession if they post a negative growth and thus this could have a spill-over effect on global markets."" ""In India, the vehicle sales figures will continue to fuel stock-specific moves on D-Street as investors attempt to decipher the future trend,"" Shah added, ""Moreover, the monthly F&O expiry in the second half of the week may cause volatility in the indices. Investors are thus advised to accumulate good stocks with strong fundamentals, free cash flows, and lower leverage over the long run while disregarding short-term difficulties."""

Unlike a fixed deposit, which requires a lump-sum deposit to create an account, an RD allows you to invest on a monthly basis, similar to a mutual fund SIP, and receive interest rates that are comparable to fixed deposits. You can not only earn good returns on your RD by making monthly deposits, but you can also manage your emergency fund more effectively by not parking a lump sum amount at once. RD, like other deposit products, is insured by DICGC up to ₹5 lakhs, minimizing deposit security risk to almost zero. Because interest rates are rising, now is the ideal time to create an RD account. Here are the banks that have raised their recurring deposit interest rates promptly after the RBI raised the repo rate to 4.90 per cent.  On 17th June 2022, HDFC Bank made interest rate revisions on RDs across selected tenors.

The upgrade of the BCAs does not result in any change in the deposit ratings because these are already at the same level as the India sovereign rating (Baa3 stable), the global rating agency said. ""The upgrade of the two banks' BCAs is driven by improvements in asset quality, capital, and profitability. Their asset quality has seen a significant improvement, with both the gross and net non-performing loans (NPL) ratios declining. ""Credit costs have also reduced at the same time as provision coverage has increased. Lower credit costs have resulted in higher profitability,"" it said. ICICI Bank and Axis Bank's return on assets for the year ending March 2022 was 1.8 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively, compared to an average of 0.8 per cent and 0.4 per cent over the four years ending March 2020, it said. ICICI Bank's profitability has also benefited from rising net interest margins as the share of the low margin international business has come down in the last four years, it added. Both lenders have raised equity capital, resulting in significantly higher capital ratios, it said, adding the core equity tier 1 ratios of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank at end March 2022 were 17.6 per cent and 15.2 per cent respectively, compared to 13.6 per cent and 11.3 per cent at end March 2019. However, it said, Axis Bank's proposed acquisition of Citigroup Inc's India consumer assets will result in an approximately 230 bps decline in capital at the bank. As Axis Bank has good access to capital markets, the ratings agency expects the bank to raise capital to maintain its current capital ratios. Axis Bank is targeting to close the acquisition by March 2023.  (With inputs from PTI)"

We recommend a BUY rating on the stock and assign a 26 x P/E multiple to its FY24E earnings of ₹71.1/share to arrive at a TP of ₹1,850/share, implying an upside of 25% from the CMP.   Oil prices recovered on Thursday from a steep drop in the previous session, supported by tight oil supply and peak summer consumption, after a U.S. rate hike sparked fears of slower economic growth and less fuel demand. Brent crude futures rose 77 cents, or 0.7%, to $119.28 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures climbed to $116.33 a barrel, up $1.02, or 0.9%.

The sharp increase in aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices and the depreciation of the rupee have left the domestic airlines with no choice but to immediately raise airfares, said Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director, SpiceJet, on Thursday. A minimum 10-15% increase in air fares is required to ensure that cost of operations are better sustained, Singh said in a statement.   The short-term trend of Nifty continues to be weak with rangebound action. Such lack of strength at the important support signal chances of false downside breakout or one leg of downside before showing sharp upside bounce from the lows of around 15,500 levels in the short term. Immediate resistance for Nifty is placed at 15,780 levels.   Prices of aviation turbine fuel (ATF), or jet fuel, surged to a record high of ₹1.4lk/litre in the national capital after oil marketing companies raised prices by 16%. Prices of the fuel have risen 91% in the last six months.   India's petrol consumption jumped 54% and that of diesel soared 48% in the first fortnight of June from a year earlier with continuing demand recovery from a relatively low base in 2021 when the world's third-biggest oil user was in the grip of the second wave of COVID-19. Petrol sales by state-owned fuel retailers, which control roughly 90% of the market, at 1.28 million tonnes during 1-14 June rose 54.2% on year. Month-on-month sales were up 0.8%, preliminary industry data showed on Wednesday. Diesel, the most-used fuel in the country, saw sales jumping 47.8% year-on-year to 3.4 million tonnes during the first 14 days of June. This was 12% higher on month.

On Wednesday, sliding for the fourth straight day, the Sensex shed 152 points in choppy trade to close at 52,541.39, an over 10-month low. The broader Nifty50 declined 39.95 points to end at 15,692.15.   Stocks and US equity futures climbed Thursday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said super-sized interest-rate hikes will be rare following the central bank’s biggest increase in borrowing costs since 1994. An Asian share gauge added about 1%, led by Japan, while Hong Kong and China fluctuated. US contracts increased about 0.5% in the wake of a Wall Street rally that halted a five-day, 10% rout in the S&P 500. The Fed raised rates 75 basis points Wednesday, stepping up the fight against inflation. Powell signaled another big hike in July but added “today’s 75 basis-point increase is an unusually large one and I do not expect moves of this size to be common."" That leans against the risk of a string of jumbo moves. S&P 500 futures rose 0.6% and the Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.7%. The Nasdaq 100 rose 2.5% Japan’s Topix index increased 1.6%, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.5%, South Korea’s Kospi index rose 1.6%, while Hang Seng Index fell 0.3% and Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.1%. Overnight, Wall Street stocks rallied following the Federal Reserve's sharpest hike to interest rates since 1994, and its later assurance that such mega-hikes would not be common.  "

The other lenders include – Bank of Baroda (BOB), Bank of Baroda (New Zealand) Ltd, Bank of India, Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Union Bank of India. In a statement, Fitch said, ""Fitch Ratings has revised the Outlook to Stable from Negative on the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) of 9 India-based banks, while affirming their IDRs."" The IDRs are based on Fitch's assessment of high to moderate probability of extraordinary state support for these banks, which takes into account its assessment of the sovereign's ability and propensity to provide extraordinary support. It factors in the government's consistent record of supporting systemically important banks, the lenders' relative systemic importance and their different ownership, Fitch said. Separately, Fitch also revised the outlook on Export-Import Bank of India's (EXIM) Long-Term IDR to stable from negative. These rating actions follow Fitch's revision of the outlook on the 'BBB-' rating on India to stable from negative last week due to diminished downside risks to the country's medium-term growth, which is underscored by its rapid economic recovery and easing financial sector weaknesses. ""The Outlook revision reflects our view that downside risks to medium-term growth have diminished due to India's rapid economic recovery and easing financial sector weaknesses, despite near-term headwinds from the global commodity price shock,"" Fitch said in a statement on June 10. ""We expect robust growth relative to peers to support credit metrics in line with the current rating,"" the rating agency added. Fitch expects India's GDP to grow by 7.8 percent in FY23 compared with its median forecast of 3.4 percent for countries it rateds BBB."

Updated: 14 Jun 2022,Monthly instalment bounce rates fall to more than 3-yr low,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/monthly-instalment-bounce-rates-fall-to-more-than-3-yr-low-11655149280776.html,"MUMBAI : Bounce rates, or defaults in paying equated monthly instalments (EMIs), fell to a 38-month low of 22% by value in May, well below pre-covid levels of 24-25% and near June 2019 levels as most borrowers keep repaying dues on time, according to an analysis of National Payments Corp. of India (NPCI) data by ICICI Securities. EMI bounce rates reached a peak in June 2020 following the shock of the first covid-19 wave that led to disruption in income generation amid widespread restrictions on movement. It again rose in May and June 2021 after the second wave wreaked havoc but has since been on a decline. By volume of transactions, 29% of the auto-debit transactions failed in May, down from 29.9% in the previous month, taking it to a 33-month low. Analysts at ICICI Securities said that improving bounce rate trajectory, after a surprising rise in March, suggests that slippages and credit cost will descend in FY23. “Also, Q4FY22 earnings reflected that asset quality woes have waned for financiers and the focus is shifting back to growth,"" they said in a report on 11 June. However, as the rate cycle has turned, there are some concerns with regard to bounce rates as higher interest rates might affect the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments. Going by bounce rate trends during the third wave of covid-19, borrower incomes seemed to have been mostly insulated. “Given inflationary pressures, rising input costs, and surprise hikes in benchmark rates, we will watch out for the extent of decline in asset quality,"" the report said. This data does not reflect intra-bank standing instructions and is only for inter-bank mandates and those between a bank and a non-bank lender. These are recurring payments where borrowers have agreed to auto-debit mandates and funds are drawn on a monthly basis from their bank accounts. Meanwhile, banks are facing a fresh spike in bad loans, with close to 9% of the debt restructured under the Reserve Bank of India’s pandemic relief plan turning sour in the last six months of 2021-22, data compiled by Mint showed. Bad loan numbers are improving, but analysts are cautious about future delinquencies arising out of the restructured book."

The domestic equities also tracked global woes as investors betted cautiously ahead of US Fed and European Central Bank policy. Following this, more than ₹5.16 lakh crore of investors' wealth has been wiped out from Dalal Street. Nearly half of the total losses were seen in the top -10 most valued companies.

The top ten most valued companies accounted for nearly half of the losses witnessed on Dalal Street. As per a PTI report, the market capitalisation (m-cap) of the top-10 most valued companies eroded by over ₹2.29 lakh crore last week.

And, in the face of rising interest rates, debt investors with a low-risk profile can consider investing in fixed deposits, which are instruments that are not linked to market-based returns and provide you with regular or fixed income based on your chosen tenure, which ranges from 7 days to 10 years.

Updated: 09 Jun 2022,ICICI Bank home loan EMIs to increase as the bank hikes EBLR by 50 bps,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/icici-bank-home-loan-emis-to-increase-as-the-bank-hikes-eblr-by-50-bps-11654758881879.html,"ICICI Bank, a leading private sector bank in India, has upped its external benchmark lending rate (EBLR) by 50 basis points to 8.60 per cent from 8.10 per cent before. According to the bank's website, the change will take effect on June 8, 2022, following the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raising the repo rate by 50 basis points (bps) to 4.90% in its monetary policy committee meeting (MPC) held on Wednesday. ""ICICI Bank External Benchmark Lending Rate"" (I-EBLR) is referenced to RBI Policy Repo Rate with a mark-up over Repo Rate. I-EBLR is 8.60% p.a.p.m. effective June 8, 2022,"" the bank has mentioned on its website. On 10-02-2022, the repo rate stayed steady at 4.00%, and the repo rate was increased to 4.40% at the RBI's MPC meeting on 04-05-2022, and the repo rate was hiked to 4.90% at the previous MPC meeting on 08-06-2022, meaning a total repo rate rise of 0.90% for the fiscal year 2022. Because of the 90-bps increase in the repo rate, lenders such as banks and other financial institutions will raise their lending rates appropriately, which in turn will cause your EMIs to go up, resulting in a hurdle to managing your personal finance. A day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) increased the repo rate by 50 basis points (bps), other major banks such as Bank of India (BoI), Bank of Baroda (BoB), and Punjab National Bank effectively lifted their external benchmark lending rate.  The bank has mentioned on its website that “The RLLR has been changed from 6.90% to 7.40% {Repo Rate (4.90%) + Mark-up (2.50%)} w.e.f. 09-06-2022 for existing and new customers. Along with RLLR BSP of 25 bps will be charged."" The RLLR, as the name implies, is linked to the repo rate set by the RBI and is changed on a routine basis. This implies that if the RBI changes the repo rate, it will influence your home loan interest rate and, as a result, your EMIs will go up.  BoB changed the interest rate on certain retail loans linked to the Baroda Repo Linked Lending Rate [BRLLR] on June 9, 2022. The bank has mentioned on its website that “For Retail Loans applicable BRLLR is 7.40% w.e.f. 09.06.2022 (Current RBI Repo Rate:4.90%+Mark-Up-2.50%), S.P.0.25%."" Currently, interest rates on home loans at Bank of Baroda vary from 7.40 per cent to 8.75 per cent, translating to a 0.9 per cent increase in EMI for outstanding customers. Customers who get a home loan, mortgage loan, car loan, education loan, personal loan, or any other retail loan product would be impacted by higher interest rates because all retail loans are linked to the BRLLR (External benchmark-Repo linked rate). With this change in the BoB BRLLR, home loan rates begin at 7.40 per cent, car loan rates begin at 7.90 per cent, mortgage loan rates begin at 9.10 per cent, and education loan rates begin at 7.15 per cent.  BOI has mentioned on its website that “The effective RBLR w.e.f from 08/06/2022 is 7.75% as per the revised Repo rate (4.90%)."" As a result, borrowers will face higher interest rates on bank loan products such as Star Top Up Loan, Star Personal Loan Scheme, Home Loan, Star Pensioner Loan Scheme, Star Vehicle Loan, Star Educational Loans, Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Rin Yojana, Star Loan Against Property, and all other loan products.  The public sector lender increased the RBLR (4.40 percent +2.85%) + CRP to RBLR (4.90 percent +2.85%) + CRP. The bank's declaration dated 09.06.2022 and a 50 basis point increase will affect borrowers who use the bank's retail loan products such as housing loans, auto loans, school loans, personal loans, and other loans that are linked to the benchmark-linked lending repo rate. In response to the RBI Monetary Policy Meeting on Wednesday, where the governor, Shaktikanta Das, announced a repo rate rise of 50 basis points, Mr. George Alexander Muthoot, MD, Muthoot Finance, stated that ""In the light of the uncertainty of persisting geopolitical tensions, concerns over rising global inflation and escalation in global crude oil prices and other commodities, we had expected the RBI to hike interest rates in consonance with the recent off-cycle policy meeting. The RBI has further hiked the repo rate by 50bps to 4.9% and will be focused on 'withdrawal of accommodation' to ensure inflation remains within target going forward while supporting growth. RBI further retained its FY23 GDP forecast at 7.2% on the back of recovery in urban demand and improving rural demand conditions along with expectations of normal monsoon. The push from the government on capex and increase in capacity utilization is likely to bolster well domestic economic activity. The RBI has also reiterated that they will ensure adequate liquidity in the banking system for productive purposes of the economy. We are optimistic that with pick up in both urban and rural demand, there will be a pick-up in demand for gold loans in the industry in the upcoming quarters."" As of now, the banking system has already started revealing to us that loan products will become more expensive as banks raise interest rates further, and higher EMIs will impact borrowers to become debt-free sooner, but retail investors looking for a fixed income from bank deposit products will rejoice as banks may raise interest rates on fixed deposits and savings accounts soon, which is good news for debt investors who find equity markets riskier to invest in."

Updated: 09 Jun 2022,ICICI Bank hikes MCLR: How does it compare with other private banks?,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/icici-bank-hikes-mclr-how-does-it-compare-with-other-private-banks-11654753507135.html,"The MCLR (Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate) has been raised by leading private sector lender ICICI Bank. According to the bank's statement on June 1, 2022, and based on the revision, the bank's overnight and one-month MCLR sits at 7.30 per cent, three-month MCLR stands at 7.35 per cent, six-month MCLR stands at 7.50 per cent, and one-year MCLR is at 7.55 per cent. These rates reflect how a borrower's EMI would be affected. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday hiked its key policy rate, the Repo rate — the rate at which it lends money to commercial banks by 50 basis points from 4.40 per cent to 4.90 per cent, implying that interest rates on loan products will rise even higher in the near future, making it difficult for borrowers to become debt-free sooner. ICICI Bank also increased its external benchmark lending rate (EBLR) by 50 basis points (bps) to 8.60 per cent from 8.10 per cent, promptly after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised the repo rate to 4.90 per cent. ICICI Bank's new EBLR rates are effective as of 8th June 2022. The bank has mentioned on its website that ""ICICI Bank External Benchmark Lending Rate"" (I-EBLR) is referenced to RBI Policy Repo Rate with a mark-up over Repo Rate. I-EBLR is 8.60% p.a.p.m. effective June 8, 2022."" We noticed that the ICICI Bank offers personal loans with interest rates ranging from 10.50 per cent to 19 per cent per annum, and auto loans with interest rates ranging from 7.35 per cent to 8.50 per cent for new cars and 10.50 per cent to 15.00 per cent for old cars. ICICI Bank Gold Loan interest rates range from 10% to 19.8%, and after the repo rate hike, all of these loan products may give you new interest rates with a 50 basis point increase shortly.  Yes Bank's overnight MCLR is 7.10 per cent, its one-month MCLR is 7.55 per cent, its three-month MCLR is 7.70 per cent, its six-month MCLR is 8.50 per cent, and its one-year MCLR is 8.75 per cent as of June 1, 2022. Personal interest rates at Yes Bank now begin at 10.99 per cent, gold loan interest rates vary from 9.00 per cent to 15.00 per cent, and auto loan interest rates begin at 9.7 per cent per annum. Borrowers would have to pay higher EMIs on their existing loans after the bank raised its Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate (MCLR) across tenures by 15-25 basis points.  With effect from June 7, 2022, HDFC Bank increased its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) on loans of all tenures by 35 basis points. Previously, HDFC Bank increased the MCLR by 25 basis points on May 7, 2022. The overnight MCLR is now 7.50 per cent, up from 7.15 per cent earlier, according to the private lender's website. The one-month MCLR is 7.55 per cent, three-month and six-month MCLR are both 7.60% and 7.70%, one-year MCLR will now be 7.85 per cent, 7.95 per cent for two years MCLR, and 8.05 per cent for three years MCLR. As a result of this increase, housing, car, personal, and other loans would all become more pricey, and borrowers will have to pay higher EMIs on their outstanding loan amount.  IDFC First Bank, a private sector lender, announced a change in MCLR on June 8, 2022. Following the revision, the bank's overnight and one-month MCLR is at 7.85 per cent, three-month MCLR stands at 8.05 per cent, six-month MCLR stands at 8.35 per cent, and one-year MCLR stands at 8.65 per cent. IDFC First Bank's personal loan interest rates begin at 10.49 per cent, house loan interest rates begin at 7.10 per cent for salaried persons and 7.50 per cent for self-employed individuals, and auto loan interest rates begin at 7.75 per cent. By commenting on the repo rate hike Mr. Umesh Revankar, Vice Chairman & MD, Shriram Transport Finance has said “The RBI, largely on expected lines, hiked the repo rate by 50 bps with the MPC focussing on ‘withdrawal of accommodation’ to ensure inflation remains around the medium-term inflation target, while supporting growth. As the inflationary expectations have been rising, the RBI hiked the FY23 inflation forecast to 6.7%, but retained the FY23 GDP forecast at 7.2%. The rise in inflation is largely attributable to global crude oil prices and the geo-political environment. The RBI has been taking measures to tame excess system liquidity while the Government is managing inflation by reducing tax on petroleum products and restricting exports of essential commodities. We believe the regulator may not hikes rates very aggressively hereon, and will continue to monitor the evolving growth-inflation dynamics. While surplus system liquidity has come down, the RBI has said they will ensure adequate system liquidity for productive purposes. As a result, we do expect borrowing cost to go up gradually. It was heartening to see that RBI expects a pick-up in investment activity and an improvement in both urban and rural demand conditions. There continue to be some challenges, but we do expect to see a pick- up in new vehicle sales as investment activity and government capex spend in the economy while used vehicle demand continue to be robust."""
Updated: 07 Jun 2022,RBI Monetary Policy: What does a repo rate hike mean to your home loan EMIs,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/rbi-monetary-policy-what-does-a-repo-rate-hike-mean-to-your-home-loan-emis-11654620941039.html,"Any change in RBI's policy repo rate makes a direct impact on banks lending and deposits interest rates as well. The six-member monetary policy committee (MPC) is set to present bi-monthly monetary policy outcomes tomorrow. A rate hike is on the cards! Experts believe RBI could increase key interest rate from 25 basis points to as highest as 50 basis points to tackle inflationary pressures which is well above the central bank's comfort levels. But a repo rate hike is likely to make EMIs costlier going forward.  Interest rates on term loans such as houses, cars, and personal are linked with the external benchmark including the repo rate. When RBI's policy rate gets higher this also leads to a higher cost of funds for banks. Hence, banks raise interest rates which ultimately hits your pocket as monthly instalments (EMIs) get costlier. Last month, RBI increased the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 40 basis points to 4.40% with immediate effect. The rate hike was done to maintain sufficient liquidity and to tackle inflationary pressure. After the rate hike, many banks including SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, and Kotak Bank among others also hiked their MCLR (Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate) and other lending benchmarks. What do experts expect from the upcoming RBI policy? According to Dhananjay Sinha, MD & Head –Strategist, JM Financial Institutional Securities, the combination of external vulnerabilities and higher fiscal deficits will complicate matters for RBI as it juggles between multiple objectives of inflation control, orderly currency, and Gsec yield scenario. Our assessment indicates that RBI’s currency management in the face of rising US rates and the strong dollar has translated into rising exchange rate rigidity and it reflects in decline in RBI’s forex reserve by USD 42bn from the peak to USD 600bn. Thus, in the context of continued rate and quantitative tightening by the US Federal Reserve will result in both liquidity moderation in India along with further rate hikes. Further, Sinha said, inflation management is tricky as the real repo rate is deeply negative at -3.4% (4.4%-headline CPI at 7.8%) and -2.6% assuming core inflation of 7%. Thus, to arrive at a neutral real rate of 1% RBI will have to substantially increase the repo rate and tighten liquidity. Assuming that core inflation softens to 6% in the next 12 months the short-term rates will have to be at 7% from the current level of ~4% (overnight call money rate). This would ideally call form about 200-250bp addition repo rate hike."" ""Over the next 12 months RBI can be expected to hike rates by 150bp at least and a 40-50bp hike on Jun 8th,"" Sinha added. Indranil Pan - Chief Economist at Yes Bank said, ""We see the RBI extending its 40bps repo hike of May with a 35bps increase in June, followed by 25bps each in August and September. By this time, we expect the global growth to have softened enough to pull down commodity prices and thus provide some comfort to the domestic inflation cycle too. We thus factor in the RBI to press the pause button again after a 15bps insurance hike in the repo rate in December and analyze the implications of its rate hike cycle of 140 bps on growth before taking any further decision."" On markets sentiment towards RBI's upcoming policy, Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, ""The market has factored a hike up to 50bps of repo rate & CRR, but any further stricter measures to clamp liquidity due to lingering inflation will have ramifications on the market trend. Apart from the monetary measures, the RBI’s guidance on growth and inflation forecast will determine the market trend."" What does a rate hike mean to your home loan EMIs? Ashish Khandelia, Founder, Certus Capital said, ""We expect the repo increase to be between 40-50bps in upcoming MPC meeting with future increases leading to ~5.75% (where we were exactly 3 years ago) or upwards by the end of FY23."" On home loans, Khandelia said, ""Last 40 bps increase in May caused homes loans to move into 7% +/- range from ~6.5% earlier. And by the end of this financial year, home loan rates will likely touch ~8%. This is unlikely to derail the housing momentum but it will certainly soften it. Coupled with increasing prices, the growth may slow down a bit in FY23, after a record FY22."" Here are some major banks' home loan rates: State Bank of India: With effect from June 1, SBI's home loan rates have been increased. However, to avail of the lowest interest rate at SBI, your CIBIL score matters. Under SBI's regular home loans, for a credit score above or equal to 800 - the interest rate will be lowest at 7.05% with a max gain of 7.45%. Between 750 - 799 credit scores, the interest rate is 7.15%, while on 700-749 credit scores - the interest rate is 7.25%. For credit scores 650-699, the interest rate will be 7.35%, whereas on credit scores of 550-649 - the rate is 7.55%. For NTC/ no cibil score, the interest rate is 7.25%. HDFC Bank: The lender offers special home loan rates. For loans up to ₹30 lakh, the interest rate is 6.75 to 7.2% for salaried women and 6.80 to 7.30% for others. Meanwhile, for home loans from ₹30.01 lakh to ₹75 lakh, the interest rate is 7.00 to 7.50% for salaried women and 7.05 to 7.55% for others. For home loans above ₹75.01 lakh, a salaried woman will have an interest rate ranging from 7.10 to 7.60% and others will pay a 7.15 to 7.65% rate. ICICI Bank: From May 4th, ICICI Bank revised its home loan rates linked with a repo rate (RR) of 4.4%. To salaried borrowers, ICICI Bank's home loans up to ₹35 lakh have an interest rate of 7.1% to 7.55%, while for loans up to ₹35 lakh to ₹75 lakh - the rate is 7.1% on the lowest front and maximum 7.7%. For home loans above ₹75 lakh, the lowest rate is 7.1% but can go maximum up to 7.8%."

Updated: 02 Jun 2022,"ICICI Securities sets 'Buy' rating on HDFC Bank, positive on post-merger growth",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/icici-securities-gives-buy-rating-on-hdfc-bank-sets-a-target-price-of-rs-1-955-hdfc-merger-deal-to-drive-growth-11654182099092.html,"The largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank is well placed ahead after its merger with parent HDFC. The merger is expected to sustain the growth momentum of HDFC Bank. The bank's senior management team has shared better visibility on the strategic merger and its benefits during their analysts' meet. ICICI Securities has given a 'Buy' rating on HDFC Bank shares as analysts here are optimistic about the acquisition deal. In their research note, ICICI Securities Research Analysts Kunal Shah, Renish Bhuva, and Chintan Shah, stated that the senior management team of HDFC Bank (HDFCB) shared their perspective and thoughts on - 1) Why this is an opportune time to fructify the merger given housing loan growth opportunity with deeper penetration, regulatory convergence, conducive market development, pricing convergence, portfolio rebalancing, enhanced cross-sell, etc. 2) What gives them confidence on merger being approved in the proposed form and structure. 3) How the merged entity will continue to grow well above industry average as demonstrated in the past. 4) Reversion in RoE is estimated to be quick as capital is consumed and 5) How it will significantly accelerate its deposit engine through deeper and broader network expansion, reactivating front-end team aggression and not being an outlier on deposit rates. In May last year, the housing sector has got an impetus with the launch of RERA. GST, etc. and the downcycle since FY13 seems to have ended in FY21 as transactions are rising. The analysts revealed that during its May’21 strategy session, the housing segment was presented as a growth theme for the country and the bank realised it is missing out on an opportunity with its home loans constituting merely 6% of advances. Further, they said that since then, real estate inventory levels have fallen substantially (>20% from their peak), developers’ balance sheets have strengthened (through deleveraging), affordability has improved and housing demand is rising in Tier-2/3 cities. Also, they highlighted that real estate is expected to bolster economic growth, but HDFC Bank is not participating in this opportunity in its truest sense. And hence, the merger scenario was becoming an ideal choice for penetrating the housing segment in its fullest forms. Of its 71 million HDFC Bank customers, only 2% opted for HDFC home loans while ~5% of the bank customers have availed of mortgages externally. Meanwhile, the majority of the HDFC's customers, somewhat about 70%, are not banking with HDFCB which presents yet another addressable opportunity. Also, it was understood that the conversion of a mortgage from an agency product to an in-house product was required. Regulatory convergence and market developments over time have improved the risk-reward equation. As per the analysts, HDFC Bank's business heads highlighted franchise strength, opportunities, initiatives, and strategies in their respective domains. Here are the key highlights of the benefits HDFC Bank will be able to achieve from the merger as per the analysts. 1. Corporate banking strategy is to increase its share of wallet and product holdings for existing-to-bank (ETB) clients. It has reimagined the supply chain landscape. Identified growth opportunities include - i) new-to-bank (NTB) corporate clients, ii) corporates looking to tap PLI scheme benefits, and iii) becoming the largest and most preferred bank for MNCs. 2. Commercial & rural banking segment, an enabler for 60-70% of the bank’s PSL requirement, has the potential to grow at 25-30% in FY23 targeting to achieve FY23 disbursements equivalent to outstanding book as of FY22. It will double its revenues by FY25 and can consistently deliver more than 3% RoAs. Strategy is oriented towards geographical expansion, market share gain, customer acquisition and deeper village penetration. 3. In retail banking, the bank has launched India’s first digital end-to-end car loan disbursing engine. It is looking to launch digital end-to-end solutions for NTB customers for personal loans by Q3FY23. Bank will also increase its distribution presence for gold loans by 3x and offer the product pan-India by Q4FY23. 4. Bank differentiates on digital/tech landscape by delivering technology at a global scale (7x UPI switch volumes in 3 years, 3x growth in core banking transaction volumes, 4.4bn ATM switch transactions in FY22) through assisted (rural) and unassisted (urban) journey experience. 5. Bank will launch Payzapp 2.0 mobile commerce payment app, which will facilitate frictionless customer onboarding and accept all payment forms (UPI, cards, BNPL, wallet, etc.) across offline and online merchant acceptance points for all spend categories. Other digital initiatives include Turbo No Touch Digital Card Program, a self-service digital platform to access and service card payments, and SmartHub Vyapaar 2.0. They said, ""Garnering liability will be key and the bank will accelerate its deposit engine. Bank would not be an outlier on rates and pricing will not be a strategy to garner deposits. Expansion in-network and reactivating front-end team aggression will be key to push the liability engine."" ICICI Securities analysts said, ""The interaction addressed some of the queries relating to the merger and provided better visibility on strategic intent and how synergy benefits would more than offset any statutory drag. Maintain BUY."" The analysts have set a target price of Rs1,955 apiece on HDFC Bank going forward. On Thursday, HDFC Bank shares closed at ₹1385.10 apiece down by 0.80% on BSE. The bank's market valuation stood at ₹7,69,007.43 crore. It continues to be the third largest company in terms of market capitalisation on stock exchanges. Taking into consideration the target price and June 2nd stock exchange closing price, HDFC Bank has the potential to jump by more than 41% ahead."

Yes Bank increased its Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate (MCLR) across tenures by 15-25 basis points after making this announcement on June 1, 2022 and as a result loan EMIs will rise for borrowers who are borrowed or are going to apply for MCLR-linked loans. Yes Bank's overnight MCLR has been raised to 7.10 per cent as a result of the adjustment. While the bank's one-month MCLR was raised to 7.55 per cent, the three-month MCLR was raised to 7.70 per cent, the six-month MCLR was raised to 8.50 per cent, and the one-year MCLR was raised to 8.75 per cent. Yes Bank's Base Rate is 8.50 per cent as of September 1, 2021, and its BPLR is 19.75 per cent as of July 26, 2011.   MCLR rates have been modified for all banks as a result of the RBI repo rate rise to 4.40 per cent. The state-owned Punjab National Bank (PNB) upped its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate by 15 basis points on June 1, 2022. PNB's one-year MCLR rate has risen to 7.40 per cent from 7.25 per cent before the modification. Many financial institutions have recently raised their marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) across tenures, including the State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, ICICI Bank, and HDFC HFC. All-new floating rate personal or retail loans, as well as floating-rate loans to MSMEs, shall be based on an external benchmark, according to RBI rules. With effect from June 1, 2022, HDFC increased its Retail Prime Lending Rate (RPLR) by 5 basis points on Housing loans, on which its Adjustable Rate Home Loans (ARHL) are benchmarked. ICICI Bank, on the other hand, has increased its marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR) by 30 basis points across all tenures and overnight, bringing the one-month MCLR to 7.30 per cent as of June 1, 2022. The state-owned Bank of Baroda (BoB) announced a 10-basis-point rise in its lending rate on May 12, 2022. The bank has increased the marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) on different tenures by up to 0.1 per cent, with the 1-year MCLR being raised to 7.40 per cent which was earlier 7.35%. Borrowers who have taken out MCLR-based loans can either prepay the loan to reduce the amount of interest they pay and the amount of principal they owe, allowing them to become debt-free sooner, or they can part-pay off their loan, lowering their EMIs and the total interest they pay."

Have shares become cheaper",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/lic-m-cap-drops-over-rs-87-500-cr-against-ipo-issue-price-have-shares-become-cheaper-11654098774627.html,"India's largest insurer, LIC has been struggling since the time of its listing on stock exchanges. The shares still trade lower from their IPO issue price. And the FY22 financial performance further added to its woes. So far this week, the behemoth's market cap has declined drastically and on Wednesday LIC tumbled to become the seventh most valued company with ICICI Bank overtaking the sixth spot. LIC currently is near its all-time low. On BSE, LIC shares closed in red at ₹810.55 apiece, however, flat compared to the previous closing. Its market cap stands at ₹5,12,672.69 crore. LIC floated between an intraday high and low of ₹817 apiece and ₹808.55 apiece respectively today. The shares neared their 52-week low of ₹801.55 apiece. This led LIC's market cap to decline to the seventh rank from the previous sixth position in the top ten most valued companies on exchanges. At Dalal Street, ICICI Bank surpassed LIC and bagged the sixth rank with a market cap of ₹5,23,353.87 crore. When LIC was listed on May 17, it held the fifth rank in terms of market capitalisation and since then has lost its spot to Hindustan Unilever and ICICI Bank. On Tuesday, LIC said it booked a profit of ₹42,000 crore from its investment in the stock market for the financial year FY22 - higher compared to a profit of ₹36,000 crore in FY21. While interacting with the media, Raj Kumar, managing director, LIC said that LIC is the largest asset manager in India, with assets of close to ₹42 trillion under management, besides being the largest domestic investor in the local stock market. It invests approximately 25% of its assets in Indian equities. Kumar also pointed out that LIC's fourth quarter of FY22 was not compared with the Q4 of last year as the insurer started reporting quarterly profits from the September quarter of 2021. LIC's management further said that they are conducting an exercise to calculate the Indian embedded valuation, value of a new business, and the margin of new business, which is expected to be completed by 30 June. Before the IPO, LIC's embedded valuation stood at ₹5.39 trillion. ""We are implementing a new IT solution for calculation of IEV and we need to cross-check all the data to be absolutely sure the new system is perfect, although the two previous data (September and December) were perfectly matching our liabilities,"" Kumar said. LIC registered a growth of 6.1% in the Net Premium Income at ₹4,27,419 crore for FY22 as compared to ₹4,02,844 crore in the previous fiscal. LIC's net profit for the full year stood at ₹4,043.12 crore increasing by 39.39% as against ₹2,900.57 crore in FY21. Further, in FY22, the company's Yield on Investments on policyholders' funds excluding unrealized gains was at 8.55 % as against 8.69% in FY21. The insurer's net NPAs in the policyholders' fund declined to 0.04% in FY22 as compared to 0.05% in the previous fiscal. Also, the solvency ratio for the year ended March 31, 2022, was 1.85 against 1.76 for the period ended March 31, 2021. At the IPO's upper price band of ₹949 apiece, LIC's market cap stood at ₹6,00,242 crore. However, since its debut, LIC shares and market cap have corrected sharply. Against its IPO upper price band, LIC shares have nosedived by nearly 15% as of today. While its market cap has dropped by over ₹87,569 crore against the IPO issue price. Have LIC shares become cheaper? For how long the shares will continue to be under pressure? Manish Jeloka, Co-head Products & Solutions, Sanctum Wealth said, ""The drop in Q4 net profit, lower 13th-month persistency, and lower than expected dividend payout have spooked LIC investors."" Jeloka added, ""In the run-up to the IPO and after the results, the management has reiterated its focus on increasing the share of the non-par business, improve VNB margins, arrest market share decline and focus on reducing expense ratios."" Further, Jeloka said, ""Given that LIC is such a behemoth, these changes will be at best gradual and so will be the multiple rerating. Inexpensive valuations provide a lot of comfort to LIC investors."""

Updated: 01 Jun 2022,"ICICI Bank, Punjab National Bank, HDFC raise lending rates",https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/icici-bank-punjab-national-bank-hdfc-raise-lending-rates-11654070771238.html,"NEW DELHI: Two large banks – ICICI Bank and Punjab National Bank – and mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp (HDFC) on Wednesday hiked their lending rates in the range of 5-30 basis points (bps) as lenders adjust pricing of assets in a rising interest rate scenario. ICICI Bank and PNB raised their marginal cost of funds-based lending rates (MCLR), an internal benchmark used by banks to price corporate loans, by 30 bps and 15 bps across tenors, respectively. The hike in MCLR would also impact a section of retail and small business borrowers who took loans before October 2019. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had asked banks to link all new floating rate personal, and micro and small enterprises loans to an external benchmark from October 2019 and medium enterprise loans in April 2020. HDFC Ltd raised its retail prime lending rate (RPLR) on housing loans, on which its floating rate mortgages are benchmarked, by 5 bps. Loans on the RPLR benchmark are offered at a discount to customers, unlike a bank’s benchmark where loans are offered after adding a spread. For larger firms, lending rates are primarily linked to MCLR, where transmission is slower than external benchmarks like the repo and treasury bills. As of 31 December, 70.9% of all loans to large industries were linked to MCLR and 20.4% to external benchmarks. For small businesses, loans linked to MCLR were at 24.2% of their aggregate loans, while 69.2% of loans were on external benchmarks, as per data from the Reserve Bank of India. The rate-setting panel of RBI met out-of-turn last month to “reassess the evolving inflation-growth dynamics"" and the impact of the developments after its previous meeting in April. All six members of the committee voted for a 40 bps hike in repo rate that takes the repo rate up to 4.4%. It is expected that there are more hikes in the offing as the central bank tries to tame inflation. Following RBI’s move in May, banks raised their interest rates on loan linked to the repo rate and a few more rounds could follow."

Updated: 26 May 2022,Interest rates on FDs rise but who is paying more?,https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/interest-rates-on-fds-rise-but-who-is-paying-more-11653583626303.html,"If you are among those investors who prefer the safety of bank deposits, then a 40 basis points repo rate hike by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is good news . Major lenders such as HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank have revised their fixed deposit (FD) rates over the past three weeks. HDFC Bank is now offering 2.50-5.75% for different tenors on domestic term deposits of less than ₹2 crore, while ICICI Bank’s FDs also are in the same range. State Bank of India, which had last revised its FD rates, offers interest of 5.50% on tenors of five years and up to 10 years. Note that the highest interest rate is generally paid on tenors of five years and above and senior citizens get an additional payout on their deposits in the range of 50-75 basis points. While major scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) have been conservative in their interest payout, certain smaller banks such as IDFC First Bank are now offering FD rates in the range of 3.50-6.25%. IndusInd Bank, too, is offering interest of up to 6.50% on its domestic term deposits. Meanwhile, some small finance banks (SFBs) have now come out with higher interest rates on deposits.   Ujjivan SFB recently raised interest rates on its term deposits. Rates on deposits with tenurebetween 15 and 18 months have been raised by 75 bps to 6.75%, and those for a 990-day tenure have been increased 35 bps to 7.1%. Jana SFB offers up to 7% interest on its regular FD options. Apart from banks, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) also offer fixed deposits, which are called company FDs. Bajaj Finance Ltd recently raised its FD rates, with the highest FD rate now at 7.20% for non-senior citizens (tenure of 44 months). Notably, Shriram Transport Finance offers rates of up to 7.90% on its term deposits. According to experts, FDs are not a great investment avenue as returns after inflation and tax tend to be negative. However, FDs are good savings instrument for parking emergency or surplus funds. While company FDs are viable alternatives, investors need to be aware of the risks involved. “Compared to a bank FD, the risks are higher in case of corporate FDs. The interest rates are higher because there is additional risk. The largest credit risk at this point is that the company may not be able to pay back the depositor in terms of the interest or the principal. Keep in mind that this is not the case for all corporate FDs. Retail investors may be better off looking at other options, unless they are looking at AAA-rated NBFCs,"" said Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.com."
Updated: 26 May 2022,ICICI vs HDFC Bank: Check latest RD rates effective from May,https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/icici-vs-hdfc-bank-check-latest-rd-rates-effective-from-may-11653577071402.html,"After the RBI raised the repo rate by 40 basis points to 4.4 per cent in May, interest rates on banks' debt instruments started to rise and are currently climbing. Recurring deposit (RD) plays an essential role in personal finance for debt investors, particularly salaried persons, because the plan allows you to invest a predetermined amount on a monthly basis, allowing you to save for your wealth and unexpected crises at the same time. Without a doubt, seeking the highest interest rates on recurring deposits before investing is a good idea, but keeping track of interest rate revisions on recurring deposits is also necessary to determine whether to proceed or not. HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank both updated their recurring deposit interest rates last week, so let's have a look at the changes.  HDFC Bank raised the interest rate on recurring deposits from 27 to 120 months on May 17, 2022. Interest rates on RDs of 27 to 36 months increased from 5.20 per cent to 5.40 per cent, from 5.45 per cent to 5.60 per cent on RDs of 39 to 60 months, and from 5.60 per cent to 5.75 per cent on RDs of 90 to 120 months.  On May 21, 2022, the bank increased the interest rate on recurring deposits, raising it from 5% to 5.10% on 12-month to 24-month RDs, from 5.20% to 5.40% on 27-36-month RDs, from 5.45% to 5.60% on three- to five-year RDs, and from 5.60% to 5.75% on five- to ten-year RDs."
