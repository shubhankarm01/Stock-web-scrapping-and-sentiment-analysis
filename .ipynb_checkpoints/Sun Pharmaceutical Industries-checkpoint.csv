On Thursday, the BSE Sensex closed at 52,653.07, up 209.36 points or 0.40%. The Nifty ended at 15,778.45, up 69.05 points or 0.44%. US equity futures slid and Asian stocks dipped Friday as traders weighed signs of a slowdown ahead for megacap technology companies and risks from China’s regulatory crackdown. Treasuries and the dollar rose. Stocks fell in Hong Kong and China as well as Japan. Asia-Pacific stocks had jumped Thursday after Beijing tried to allay fears over regulatory curbs on private industries, but US-listed Chinese equities later resumed declines. S&P 500 futures also fell. The gauge rose overnight on data signaling scope for the Federal Reserve to keep policy ultra-loose. US economic growth was solid while trailing estimates. Jobless claims dropped but were higher than forecast. Among key companies, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Indian Oil Corporation, Britannia Industries, Marico, UPL, Bandhan Bank, PI Industries, JSW Energy, and Shriram Transport Finance Co.y Ltd will release their June quarter earnings today. The Maharashtra Food and Drug Authority (FDA) on Thursday said it has issued notices to e-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart after it allegedly found that pregnancy termination kits and pills are available for sale on these platforms without prescription. IFC, and two investment funds managed by IFC Asset Management Company—IFC Financial Institutions Growth Fund and IFC Emerging Asia Fund—have bought a 4.99% stake in Federal Bank Ltd for ₹916 crore, the lender said on Thursday. The dollar snapped a four-day retreat but is on course for its biggest weekly drop since May. Oil mostly held recent gains on expectations that demand from economic reopening will weather delta-strain Covid-19 flareups. Stocks are rounding out a volatile week amid Beijing’s clampdown on private enterprise, which sparked a sharp selloff in Hong Kong and China and briefly caused widespread risk aversion.

Updated: 22 Jun 2021,Sun Pharma’s Revlimid drug patent settlement does not enthuse Street,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/sun-pharma-s-revlimid-drug-patent-settlement-does-not-enthuse-street-11624378702163.html,"Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s agreement with Celgene Corp. is not enthusing investors. In fact, the Sun Pharma stock has not been able to clock much outperformance. It is just about keeping pace with the Nifty Pharma index. Returns have been around 35%, a tad lower than Nifty Pharma’s 38% gain over the past year. For now, there seem to be limited catalysts to spark an outperformance. Sun Pharma has been pushing its US business hard. Its US generics revenue grew 7% year-on-year. But even while the numbers are up, competition is catching up. Its recent agreement with Celgene Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol Myers Squibb, to resolve patent litigation over the generic Revlimid in the US highlights the same. The oncology drug is one of several big products with an annual market size of around $8 billion, and it signals a huge opportunity for Indian pharma. But Celgene is granting Sun Pharma a licence to sell a limited quantity of the generic in the US, which is set to begin after March 2022. This licence further extends the potential to an unlimited quantity after 2026. Still, many Indian generic players are knocking on the doors of this market and have struck a deal with Celgene. This not only crowds the space, but could also see a potential price-erosion in the product point analysts. As a result, the upside for the likes of Sun Pharma stock may be limited. “Six out of 11 para IV filers have settled the patent litigation case now with the majority entering the market in FY23. We estimate this opportunity represents an upside of ₹10/share for Sun Pharma on net present value basis,"" said an analyst with Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. Sun Pharma also recently inked a pact to launch the covid drug Molnupiravir in India. But analysts point out that the current contribution of the covid portfolio is minimal. In the coming quarters, much will depend on the ramp-up in its specialty segment. Analysts are pencilling specialty products to clock revenues of about $600 million in FY22, which is a decent jump compared to $473 million in FY21. But costs are also expected to rise in the second half as marketing and branding costs start to normalize. Hence, despite the uptick in revenues expected, overall margins are likely to shrink a tad this year. One positive has been the pick-up in domestic chronic segment. In fact, the domestic segment grew 13% y-o-y. However, the acute segment is facing challenges due to lower incidence of infection and low patient inflows, note analysts. That may not help its stock much as valuations are rich. “We believe current valuations amply capture all upside related to specialty,"" said analysts at Emkay Global."
Updated: 10 May 2021,"Cipla, Lupin, Sun Pharma ink pacts to make Lilly’s covid drug",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/lilly-issues-voluntary-licences-to-firms-to-speed-up-availability-of-baricitinib-11620642570712.html,"NEW DELHI : US drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co. on Monday said it has issued royalty-free, non-exclusive voluntary licences to Cipla, Lupin and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd to produce its baricitinib drug in India to help combat the deadly second wave of the pandemic in the country. The company is also in talks with other pharmaceutical firms in India to grant similar voluntary licences in an effort to expand the availability of the drug. Eli Lilly recently received permission from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) for restricted emergency use of baricitinib to be used in combination with remdesivir for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed covid-19 in hospitalized adults requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). These voluntary licensing pacts will ensure high-quality manufacturing and accessibility of baricitinib during the pandemic, improving the local treatment options available to those battling by the deadly infection, the company said in a statement. “Lilly is committed to supporting India in this healthcare challenge through our innovative and effective portfolio of breakthrough medicines. During the current surging covid-19 pandemic, we have responded by issuing three voluntary licences for baricitinib by pharmaceutical companies in India to accelerate its local manufacturing and distribution under best quality conditions,"" said Luca Visini, managing director, India subcontinent, Lilly India. “More licences to additional Indian generic manufacturers are expected to be announced soon. This is in addition to the donations being offered by Lilly to the Indian government that will potentially help alleviate the burden of covid-19. We will continue to explore other possible initiatives to support patients and the healthcare system in India,"" said Visini. Lilly is working with the Indian government to fight the pandemic through various initiatives including donations and expanding the availability of Lilly therapies. On 4 May, Lilly announced that an initial donation of 400,000 baricitinib tablets was being made immediately available through the humanitarian aid organization, Direct Relief, to the Indian government for eligible hospitalized covid-19 patients in India, while urgently working to increase product supply over the coming days. This donation furthers both Lilly and Direct Relief’s charitable goal of providing access to covid-19 treatments to patients in need, the company said. Meanwhile, Lilly continues to engage in discussions with the regulatory authorities and government in India to donate Lilly’s anti-covid-19 treatments, including its neutralizing antibodies, bamlanivimab and bamlanivimab and etesevimab which need to be administered in a single combination."

Molnupiravir is an investigational oral antiviral drug, currently being studied in a phase 3 trial for the treatment of non-hospitalized patients with confirmed covid-19. The agreements are aimed at accelerating availability of molnupiravir in India and in other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) following approvals or emergency authorization by local regulatory agencies. “We are in talks with the Government and other key stakeholders as we remain committed to expanding equitable access to medicines and bringing innovative treatments to the country,"" Rehan A Khan, managing director of MSD-India Region, said in the statement. Hetero Group chairman B. Partha Saradhi Reddy said that the company will soon approach the Drugs Controller General of India for a regulatory authorisation. “We are vertically integrated to manufacture and commercially ready to supply this product to patients swiftly across the country. We will be immediately approaching the DCGI to seek regulatory pathway and emergency use authorization,"" Reddy said. MSD is developing molnupiravir in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. “The scale of human suffering in India at this moment is devastating, and it is clear that more must be done to help alleviate it. These agreements, toward which we have been working as we have been studying molnupiravir, will help to accelerate access to molnupiravir in India and around the world,"" said Kenneth C. Frazier, chairman and chief executive officer of Merck & Co, said. MSD is known as Merck & Co in US and Canada. Under the agreements, Merck & Co., Inc., US will provide licenses to these manufacturers to supply molnupiravir to India and more than 100 LMICs. Merck & Co is also in discussions with the United Nations-led Medicines Patent Pool to explore the potential for additional licenses."
Updated: 08 Apr 2021,Pharma firms to track drug supply,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/drugmakers-come-together-to-modernize-india-s-pharma-infrastructure-11617880267157.html,"In an unprecedented move, at least half-a-dozen Indian drugmakers, including Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Cipla, Lupin and Zydus Cadila, have partnered with ABCD Technologies LLP to digitize the country’s vast medicine distribution infrastructure for better tracking of product movement. The platform will allow drug stores to gauge availability of prescription drugs, which in turn will help companies reduce wastage and address any shortages. “If you see (covid-19 drugs) favipiravir or remdesivir, so many people don’t even know where to get them. The entire supply chain between distributors, stockists and chemists is very scattered... The tracking mechanism will allow a chemists to tell patients where they can find the medicine if it is out of stock. It will also allow a distributors to recognize batches that may be about to expire and send it to chemists so that the medicine is consumed and there is no wastage,"" said Girish Vanvari, founder , Transaction Square, which managed the ABCD Technologies deal.  On Monday, ABCD Technologies LLP completed the acquisition of a 91.8% stake in Pharmarack through the purchase of shares from its shareholders for ₹111 crore. The partnership is in the process of acquiring the remaining stakes over the next five years. The entity will also pick up a 33% stake in pharmaceutical market research firm AIOCD Pharmasofttech AWACS Pvt. Ltd for ₹75 crore. Over the next few months it will acquire the remaining stakes. ABCD Technologies will be renamed IndoHealth Services LLP. “The business model of Pharmatrack is to connect distributors and chemists. Right now, they are good in Maharashtra. That will now go nationwide with the strength of the partnership. Similarly, AWACS is one of the most favoured subscriptions (for pharmaceutical market research) and that will also be grown,"" Vanvari said. The track-and-trace mechanism is similar to the Indian drug regulator’s proposed mechanism to monitor the supply chain for key drugs using a bar code system. Vanvari said the entity is also looking to rope in other pharma companies in the initiative and is in talks with some large Indian drugmakers other than the ones mentioned above. “There is a lot of interest from other pharmaceutical companies and they are keen to be a part of this initiative,"" Vanvari said but declined to name the drugmakers as they are listed on the stock exchanges. The initiative is in support of the National Digital Health Mission of the government, which had envisaged supply chain management as a key component, said the six drug companies in their respective statements."
Updated: 29 Mar 2021,China to make covid vaccines in UAE,https://www.livemint.com/news/world/china-picks-uae-as-regional-production-hub-for-sinopharm-shot-11616933879059.html,"The United Arab Emirates will start producing China’s Sinopharm vaccine next month in a deal that deepens Beijing’s influence in the Arab Gulf, long a bastion of US power. Gulf Pharmaceutical Industries PSC said on Sunday it signed a contract to start manufacturing the vaccine from April. With the accord, the UAE will become the first Gulf state to set up a coronavirus vaccine production facility, boosting its efforts to become a supply hub to the Middle East and beyond. The company, also known as Julphar, said it signed the agreement with Abu Dhabi’s G42 Medications Trading. G42, which describes itself as an artificial intelligence and cloud computing firm, had helped roll out trials of the Sinopharm vaccine in the country. The state-backed Sinopharm vaccine was approved in the UAE last year after local late-stage trials showed it was 86% effective in preventing infections -- the country has since overseen one of the world’s fastest inoculation drives, with most people having received the Chinese vaccine. The Sinopharm vaccine can be transported and stored at normal refrigerated temperatures, making it a candidate for vaccination programs in the developing world. The company’s annual production capacity for Covid vaccines is set to reach 3 billion doses, its chairman Yu Qingming said this month, without giving a time frame. While the UAE has approved vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc as well as Russia’s Sputnik V, its inoculation program hinged on Sinopharm given early availability and the potential to produce the shots locally -- key to the UAE’s aspirations of becoming a supply hub. In November, Abu Dhabi launched the Hope Consortium, a logistics grouping with the capacity to distribute more than six billion vaccine doses. The consortium includes the emirate’s Department of Health, Etihad Cargo, Abu Dhabi Ports Group, Rafed and SkyCell. In neighboring Dubai, companies including Emirates airline, ports operator DP World and Dubai Airports have also formed an alliance to move two billion doses of vaccines around the world this year, focusing on emerging markets.
