Updated: 07 Jul 2022,BHEL commissions India’s largest floating solar PV plant,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/bhel-commissions-india-s-largest-floating-solar-pv-plant-11657183392278.html,"Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) has commissioned India’s largest floating Solar PV plant rated at 100 MW at NTPC Ramagundam in Telangana. The plant is installed across the natural raw water reservoir, saving valuable land resources, and also conserves water by reducing evaporation. With innovatively engineered layouts and arrangements for the solar PV modules, electricals and floaters, the plant will ensure that the aquatic ecosystem is maintained while producing clean power. All major components of the solar plant – viz. solar PV modules, floaters, bio-degradable natural ester oil filled inverter-duty transformers, switchgear, SCADA and cables are indigenous, contributing to the government of India’s ‘Make in India’ mission. With this, BHEL has achieved the unique distinction of commissioning 3 floating solar projects – 25 MW at NTPC Simhadri, 22 MW at NTPC Kayamkulam and 100 MW at NTPC Ramagundam - in the last 10 months. Each one of them is unique in respect of their engineering and execution features. BHEL is the leading EPC player in the floating solar segment in the country. 152 MW of capacity has been commissioned so far, delivering plants on all kinds of water bodies – natural reservoirs, man-made reservoirs and saline back-water kayals. BHEL’s in- house capability for end-to-end engineering and execution of floating solar projects is supported by its dedicated and committed engineering and project teams, which have made this feat possible, a company statement said."
Updated: 07 Jul 2022,State-run NTPC invites firms to set up hydrogen unit,https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/ntpc-invites-eois-for-green-hydrogen-pilot-project-11657119615629.html,"NEW DELHI : State-run power major NTPC has invited expressions of interest (EoI) from Indian and global companies for setting up a pilot project for production of hydrogen using electrolyzers. The deadline for submitting the EoIs is 10 August, 2022. “NTPC is Inviting Expression of Interest from Indian/Global Company/their Consortium/Affiliates/Representatives for setting up a pilot project for production of part quantity of hydrogen using electrolyser technology, required for demonstrating hydrogen co-firing in one of existing gas plants of NTPC along with requisite storage, fuel cell for standalone microgrid and equipment for blending with cooking natural gas,“ said the notice inviting EoIs. It said that NTPC intends to source part quantity of hydrogen through in-house production using electrolyser technology for demonstrating the capability of hydrogen co-firing in one of the existing NTPC gas turbines and comparing different electrolyser technologies, along with all the required infrastructure for storage and compression.  Presently, alkaline, PEM and SOEC technologies are already implemented or are under pilot implementation by NTPC. It also aims to utilize the hydrogen produced either through a standalone fuel cell micro-grid or by mixing the stored hydrogen with cooking natural gas for the same NTPC Gas plant premises after trial run of gas turbine or when the hydrogen is not being used for co-firing in gas turbine.  The public sector major said that it plans to set up a hydrogen production infrastructure, storage infrastructure of hydrogen, standalone fuel-cell based microgrid system and infrastructure for blending hydrogen (5-10%) with cooking natural gas at any of its existing NTPC gas plants. It said that the interested applicants will specify the technical specification, guarantee parameters, the total estimated project cost and shall propose the financial contribution to be shared by themselves and by NTPC. “The intellectual property generated from the pilot project will be co-owned by NTPC and the applicant. The same may be monetized separately during the commercialization of the technologies,"" it said. NTPC role in the planned pilot project would be providing land for installation and commissioning of the system within its gas plant premises and provide necessary support during operation and maintenance (O&M) of the pilot project. Among other functions, it will also facilitate the applicant in applying for statutory clearances for the project and also facilitate the installation and commissioning of the system. The selected applicant on on the other hand would work on the design, engineering, manufacture, supply, erection, commissioning and testing of hydrogen plant based on selected technology, production and storage infrastructure, fuel cell based microgrid and blending system. It will also look at the routine maintenance of the systems for a period of 3 years from the date of commissioning, the notice said. PSUs and private sector companies have diversified their sources of energy towards cleaner fuel amid the policy push to achieve carbon neutrality by 2070. The green hydrogen policy released in February also has boosted the industry participation in the sector. Further, a comprehensive green hydrogen mission is also in the works and is expected to the released soon."

Updated: 02 Jul 2022,India's largest floating 100-MW solar power project now fully operational,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/indias-largest-floating-100-mw-solar-power-project-now-fully-operational-in-telangana-read-here-11656720485096.html,"The country's largest floating solar power project has become fully operational, just as NTPC declared commercial operation of the final part capacity of 20 MW out of 100 MW Ramagundam Floating Solar PV Project at Ramagundam, Telangana with effect from July 1. The operationalisation of 100-MW Solar PV Project at Ramagundam means that the total commercial operation of floating solar capacity in the Southern Region has now gone up to to 217 MW. Additionally, NTPC declared commercial operation of 92 MW Floating Solar at Kayamkulam (Kerala) and 25 MW Floating Solar at Simhadri (Andhra Pradesh). As per an official release, the 100-MW floating solar project at Ramagundam is endowed with advanced technology as well as environment-friendly features. Constructed with a financial implication of R. 423 crore, the project spreads over 500 acres of its reservoir. An official release said that with the presence of floating solar panels, the evaporation rate from water bodies is reduced, thus helping in water conservation. Notably, approximately 32.5 lakh cubic meters per year water evaporation can be avoided. The water body underneath the solar modules helps in maintaining their ambient temperature, thereby improving their efficiency and generation. Similarly, while coal consumption of 1,65,000 tons can be avoided per year, Co2 emission of 2,10,000 tons per year can be avoided,"" it added.  Meanwhile, just last week, Tata Power Solar Systems had said it has commissioned India’s largest floating solar power project of 101.6 Megawatt Peak (MWp) in Kerala backwaters. The project is installed on a 350-acre water body in Kayamkulam, Kerala, a company statement said. The installation was completed within the stipulated period, despite the arduous challenges of variable water depths, high sea tides, and severe water salinity concerns, it stated. Tata Power Solar is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Power. This project is the first in the Floating Solar Photovoltaic (FSPV) through power purchase agreement category, the company said. ""The commissioning of India's first and largest floating solar project is an innovative and incremental step toward meeting India's sustainable energy goals,"" said Praveer Sinha, CEO, and MD, Tata Power. A power purchase agreement has been signed with a PSU client, wherein the entire power generated from this plant will be used by Kerela State Electricity Board (KSEB). Interestingly, all the solar modules used in this plant were safely transported, unloaded, and stored on a limited parcel of land for about 35 days by Tata Power Solar, it said.
