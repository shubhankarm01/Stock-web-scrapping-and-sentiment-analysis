Updated: 07 Jul 2022,Telcos may see slower revenue growth in Q1,https://www.livemint.com/industry/telecom/telcos-may-see-slower-revenue-growth-in-q1-11657133640951.html,"NEW DELHI : The April-June quarter will see slower mobile revenue growth for the telecom sector due to subscriber decline for Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, fewer 4G net additions due to lower smartphone sales and diminishing benefit of the November 2021 tariff hike, analysts said. Some said the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) may have some upside coming from longer validity recharges, primarily for Reliance Jio, and one additional day in the tariff cycle—29 days versus 28 days—which was mandated by the telecom regulator. Therefore, average revenue per user (Arpu), a key metric used for measuring the profitability of a telco, is set to rise by as much as 4% for Jio, the highest among all carriers. According to ICICI Securities and ICICI Direct, RJio’s Arpu is expected to rise to ₹174, while Vodafone Idea’s Arpu will grow by 2% to ₹126 in the quarter ended June. Bharti Airtel’s Arpu is expected to grow by 3.1% to ₹184, the highest in absolute terms among the carriers. Sector watchers are also monitoring the upcoming spectrum auctions, during which they do not anticipate aggressive bidding. “We expect telecom operators to stagger their 5G spectrum purchases due to sufficient spectrum availability and lack of ecosystem. Consequently, the balance sheet commitment could be limited,"" analysts at Edelweiss said in a report seen by Mint. With little pressure on balance sheets, the additional upside to the Arpu levels will come from the next round of tariff hikes, which are likely to commence from October-December in FY23, they added. They, however, flagged inflationary pressures, which will lead to a contraction of 45-145 basis points in Ebitda margins for all carriers, even as telcos are expected to report revenue growth of 1-5% quarter-on-quarter, thanks to Arpu improvements. “Mobile revenue growth for Bharti is estimated at 1.6% on-quarter, while VIL’s will grow only 0.6% and RJio’s revenue will be up 3.3%,"" Sanjesh Jain, vice-president at ICICI Securities, said in a research note ahead of first-quarter earnings later this month. The brokerage estimated revenue for Airtel India to be ₹23,100 crore, led by the mobile business, while Africa revenue is expected to be about $1.2 billion, up 0.8% from the preceding quarter. Ebitda growth will be further restricted owing to higher power costs due to the rise in diesel prices, and Ebitda margin will be flattish quarter-on-quarter for all the three operators, the brokerage said. Airtel’s India Ebitda is expected to be around ₹11,600 crore, up 1.6% sequentially, while Africa Ebitda may be about $579 million, up 0.5% sequentially. “Consolidated revenue to rise 2.6% on-quarter to ₹32,300 crore and Ebitda will dip 1% on-quarter to ₹15,900 crore. Net profit is seen at ₹1,900 crore,"" Jain noted. For Vodafone Idea, revenue may rise 0.6% sequentially to ₹10,300 crore, negatively impacted by subscriber decline. “Vi is expected to suffer a subscriber decline of 2.5 million versus a contraction of 3.4 million in Q4FY22,"" said analysts at Edelweiss in a research note. Ebitda may drop 3.4% quarter-on-quarter (up 21% year-on-year) due to one-off gains of ₹150 crore in the base and higher power costs. “Net loss seen at ₹6,600 crore for Vodafone Idea,"" ICICI Securities’ Jain said."

It goes beyond super-fast downloads and uploads, or glitch-free video calls, live streaming, and real-time gaming. 5G holds the promise of a tech utopia — from automated cars, to robotic surgeries and much more futuristic technology. 5G may also end the monopoly of telecom companies over telecom services as the government is allocating spectrum to private enterprises too, a move that has become controversial. But that could be just a teething trouble. It’s the biggest spectrum auction with 72,000 MHz up for grabs. What is 5G? 5G, short for the fifth-generation cellular technology, promises to exponentially raise the speed and data capacity of wireless networks. Data is the new oil, as Mukesh Ambani has famously said. Data traffic is surging, estimated to be growing more than 60% every year. 5G is tailor-made to handle this data explosion globally, including in India. Unlike 4G, 5G is capable of connecting multiple devices seamlessly and can handle a staggering 1 million devices per square kilometre. In India, 5G networks will run on mid- and high-end spectrum with speed and capacities more than 10 times greater than the 4G networks.           "

Google and Airtel have executed an Investment Agreement (IA) per which the Acquirer proposes to acquire a minority and non-controlling stake of 1.28% of equity share capital. Along with the IA, the acquirer and the target through their affiliates have also entered into certain commercial deals.   The body added that the companies also intend to enter into certain other commercial arrangements in future.  Google had said in January this year that it will invest up to $1 billion in India’s No 2 telecom services provider Bharti Airtel through an equity purchase of 1.28% for $700 million and commercial agreement of $300 million on mutual terms over the next five years.    The investment comes on the back of the internet search giant having invested $4.5 billion in Reliance Jio back in July 2020, both part of the Google for India Digitization Fund, making it an investor in two rival telecom service providers in the sector.    Google has already partnered with Reliance Jio to launch of low cost smartphone – JioNext - with an optimized Android OS, as part of Google’s investment into Jio last year. Jio Platforms, the holding company of Reliance Jio, has also received a $5.7 billion investment from Facebook, now Meta, for a 9.99% stake. "

As per ICICI Securities, the three companies can cumulatively save around ₹5,400 crore from the new SUC rule, and their cash outflow will also reduce. With that, spectrum payouts will become cheaper. On Tuesday, the Department of Telecommunications in major good news for telecom firms, announced for spectrum through an auction held after September 16, 2021, in different access spectrum bands, no 'Spectrum Usage Charges' will be charged. The government will be auctioning about ₹4.3 lakh crore worth of airwaves on July 26, 2022, that will be capable of offering 5G telecom services, including ultra-high-speed internet. As much as 72 GHz of the spectrum will be put on the block during the 5G auction. Also, the government okayed for setting up of 5G networks by the tech firms. Sanjesh Jain, Research Analyst at ICICI Securities said, ""modification in SUC, issued by the DoT, will significantly reduce spectrum pay-out burden for operators from the upcoming 5G spectrum auction, and also restrict RoIC compression."" Data of ICICI Securities showed that in the fourth quarter of FY22 (Q4FY22), Airtel had the highest SUC as a percentage of AGR including NLD at 4.1%, meanwhile for peers Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio the charges were at 3.8% and 3.6% respectively as a percentage of AGR. However, the data also said that this includes SUC on the microwave spectrum which is not part of the above modification. Thereby, SUC on the access spectrum for Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and RJio works out to 3.2%, 2.9%, and 3.1%, respectively, after adjusting for SUC on the microwave spectrum. ""We have deducted 0.9% for Bharti / VIL and 0.5% for RJio from circle-wise SUC rate with a floor at 3% of AGR to reach SUC rate for access spectrum,"" the analyst said. After applying the new SUC rule on Q4FY22 (annualised) AGR, as per the analyst, it shows savings of ₹1,000 crore to ₹2,300 crore for the three telecom giants. RJio will be the biggest beneficiary with annual savings to the tune of ₹2,300 crore, while Airtel and Vodafone Idea will save up to ₹2,100 crore and ₹1,000 crore respectively. According to the analyst, the key assumptions are - 1) each operator will buy 100MHz pan-India in 3300MHz band, and 500MHz pan-India in 26GHz band in the upcoming auction, and 2) assumption of SUC on microwave spectrum. Jain said, ""Above quantity of spectrum acquired in the upcoming auction attracts nil SUC which will drop weighted average SUC rate to 0.4%/ 0.3%/0.4% for Bharti/VIL/RJio for access spectrum. Including SUC on the microwave spectrum, the new SUC rate works out to 1.3% / 1.2% / 0.9% of AGR for Bharti/ VIL/RJio, respectively. This implies annual savings of Rs21bn for Bharti; Rs10bn for VIL and Rs23bn for RJio on Q4FY22 annualised AGR."" Also, the spectrum EMI payout from the upcoming auction is expected to decline in the range of ₹1,100 crore to ₹2,400 crore for the three telcos. The spectrum EMI payout will dip to ₹1,200 crore for Airtel, ₹2,400 crore for Vodafone Idea, and ₹1,100 crore for RJio. ""If we continue with the above assumption of spectrum acquisition (100MHz pan-India in 3300MHz band, and 500MHz pan-India in 26GHz band) in the upcoming auction, total spectrum payout at reserve price is Rs352bn. If operator chose 20 years’ annual installment with a coupon rate of 7.2% (as notified in NIA) then annual installment works out to Rs33.7bn,"" Jain said. Further, the analyst added, ""If we apply corresponding savings from SUC, the annual payout for spectrum acquired in the upcoming auction reduces to Rs12bn for Bharti, Rs24bn for VIL, and Rs11bn for RJio. Unlike previous auctions, we don’t expect much pressure on FCF and RoIC from 5G spectrum auction due to modification in SUC."""
Updated: 20 Jun 2022,Telcos seek level-playing field for 5G network operations,https://www.livemint.com/industry/telecom/telcos-seek-level-playing-field-for-5g-network-operations-11655659053548.html,"NEW DELHI : Telecom operators have asked the department of telecommunications to ensure that captive 5G networks abide by all rules and regulations concerning quality of service, security, enable lawful interception by enforcement agencies among others, while remaining completely isolated from commercial networks and are set up only by end-user enterprises instead of intermediaries and system integrators. In a letter to telecom minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and telecom secretary K. Rajaraman, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which represents all the operators including Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, has opposed captive networks as permitted in a government notice inviting applications (NIA) while announcing the auctions. The communication comes close on the heels of tech companies seeking access to 5G airwaves through direct allocation, that is without participating in the auctions. The operators have laid down nearly two-dozen conditions that captive networks should comply with so that same-service-same-rules principles are applied to ensure a level playing field, in their first official response to the NIA that laid down guidelines of the spectrum auctions, stating that third parties wanting to set up 5G captive networks should take spectrum through auctions, the same way as telcos. “We reiterate that all the steps listed by us are aimed at ensuring orderly growth of the sector and maintain investors‘ confidence. Any guidelines for setting up captive non-public network (CNPN) by obtaining spectrum directly from the department of telecommunications (DoT) should be issued only after a demand study by DoT and subsequent recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India,"" the association said in the letter sent on Saturday, a copy of which was seen by Mint. Telcos have said that captive networks should not be permitted on 2G, 3G or 4G technologies and should be assigned spectrum only in the non- International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) bands. “The allocation of IMT band spectrum to CNPN is likely to fetch minuscule revenue compared to auction of such spectrum for public networks,"" said the letter. Every network element for CNPN should comply with the requirements of trusted product or trusted source set by the government, the association said. Any equipment should be installed only after obtaining approval from the National Security Council Secretariat, it said. “Given the geopolitical and cybersecurity risks and to mitigate national security concerns, CNPNs should be permitted only after installing lawful interception equipment and providing connectivity to law enforcement agencies,"" the association said. Further, CNPNs set-up using dedicated spectrum must store call or data records for two years, command logs for three years, keep records of software updates, ensure data localization, and allow remote access only from within the country and not allow remote access outside of India, COAI said. Similar conditions were put for non-captive networks, it said. Use cases meant for masses cannot be part of CNPN, the telcos said, and sought revenues earned by service providers from provision of captive network to be exempted from payment of licence fee and goods and service tax. COAI highlighted that the economic impact of captive 5G networks was marginal as per some international benchmarks even when the cost of spectrum set aside for the services was significant. It cited an assessment of economic impact by Compass Lexicon on Germany keeping aside commercial spectrum for local private networks, which found that 100 MHz set aside by the government could cause consumers welfare loss around €6.2 - €15.6 billion, while consumers may suffer from a significant degradation in quality of service. “Public network operators paid €2.2 billion extra in the German auction, money that could have been used for faster and more extensive deployment of 5G,"" COAI said, while noting that reduction in capability of public mobile networks will have ripple effect on the wider economy. “Taking away chunks of crucial spectrum to dedicate them to verticals runs the serious risk of fragmenting the available spectrum (reducing spectrum’s carrying capacity) and threatens the wider success of 5G and Digital India and can also pose a threat to national security,"" it said. The telcos said the scope of CNPN should be restricted to machine-to-machine communication inside well-defined premises and plant automation. Enterprises owning such networks should ensure they do not cause any interference to any public network or network of licensed telecom operators, comply with electromotive force norms set by DoT."

Telcos lost 7 million active subscribers in April, the sharpest decline in the past 10 months, due to SIM consolidation or users switching off second SIMs, sector watchers noted. “In the past 10 years, this is only the second time when all operators have witnessed decline in active subscribers. A continuation of this trend could indicate sim-consolidation amidst rising tariffs,"" analysts at Jeffries said in a note to clients following subscriber data released by the sector regulator. While all operators witnessed active subscriber decline in April, Jio’s decline was the lowest at 0.1m while Bharti and VIL lost 3.1 and 3.8m active subscribers, respectively, according to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) data for April issued on Thursday. The sector’s reported subscriber base rose by 0.6m in April led by Jio which added 1.7m subscribers taking its base to 406 mn and Bharti Airtel which added 0.8m subscribers to take the total to 361 mn. Vodafone Idea’s reported subscriber base declined by 1.6m to 259 mn. The number of active users of each of the telcos stood at 93% or 377.6 mn for Jio, 98% or 353.7 mn and 86% or 222.7 mn for Vodafone Idea. Overall, Jio’s subscriber addition momentum improved month-on-month, whereas Bharti’s strong momentum from earlier months seems to have slowed in April, said Navin Killa, managing director at UBS in a note on the sector. The firm added that Jio remained the market leader, with a subscriber market share of 35.5%, which increased by 10 basis points on-month, followed by Bharti Airtel with a 31.6% share and flat additions on-month in April. Vodafone Idea ended April with 22.7% share, down 10 basis points on-month. Since March 2021, sector’s active subscriber additions have been modest at 20m, but Jio has outperformed with 47m sub adds vs Bharti’s 8m, driven by the discount that Jio offers versus Bharti and Bharti’s sharp tariff hike in prepaid voice segment, analysts at Jeffries noted. Jio gained 30bps market share in active subscribers while Vodafone Idea and Bharti lost 20bps and 5bps market share, respectively. With Jio’s inactive subscribers being steady at 24-27m over Feb-Apr-22, analysts said that Jio’s subscriber cleanup has ended which could drive higher reported subscriber additions for Jio in the future. “Jio’s leadership in active subscriber adds and Bharti’s ARPU focus bode well for the sector’s tariff outlook,"" Jeffries noted. Jio was also the only operator to add rural and urban subscribers, while VIL lost subscribers on both fronts. The weak subscriber addition trends can be attributed to the Nov’21 tariff hikes and higher smartphone inflation, said Naval Seth, analyst at Emkay India Equity Research in a note to clients. Jio was the only operator to see additions in both urban and rural subscribers, while the mix for all operators remained stable. Bharti saw a marginal decline in its urban subscriber base, while Vodafone Idea lost both urban and rural subscribers.

Updated: 17 Jun 2022,Telecom firms may not bid aggressively at 5G auctions,https://www.livemint.com/industry/telecom/telecom-firms-may-not-bid-aggressively-at-5g-auctions-11655401678511.html,"Telcos are likely to pick up 5G airwaves at the reserve price and may not bid aggressively considering that surplus spectrum has been made available, brokerages tracking the auctions said. Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio are likely to purchase pan-India spectrum, while Vodafone Idea may bid for only a few circles considering its weak financial position, they said. However, the Centre’s decision to allow captive 5G networks to buy airwaves is a key concern for telcos. “More than adequate spectrum is available for the three operators, and hence we don’t expect a bidding war,"" said analysts at JP Morgan in a note to clients on Thursday. In the 3300-3650MHz spectrum band, 330MHz of airwaves has been made available for every circle, according to the notice inviting applications issued by the department of telecommunications. An operator requires 100MHz for a pan-India rollout. “We note that despite reserving 40MHz in the 3,300MHz band for public sector telcos, there is adequate spectrum for the three operators, as the spectrum cap is set at 40% (or 130MHz), which would limit the scope for aggressive bidding in our view,"" analysts at Nomura Global Markets Research had said in a note a day after the government said that 5G auctions will begin on 26 July. Sector watchers questioned the participation of Vodafone Idea, given its stretched balance sheet and its inability to raise funds but said Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio were likely to participate with an estimated annual payment of ₹2,840 crore, including interest, for pan-India 5G spectrum. “Despite no upfront payment requirements, we remain sceptical of Vodafone Idea’s ability to meaningfully participate in the auctions as it would require immediate servicing (unlike about 3.5 years of moratorium on the entire existing spectrum debt), which would be difficult given its stretched balance sheet and elusive equity fundraising,"" said analysts at Credit Suisse in a note to clients. “We believe Vi could restrict its bid for 5G spectrum to select circles, given its capex constraints, much-delayed fundraising and existing gaps in 4G coverage,"" analysts at Nomura noted. The Swiss brokerage house said in the note that while Airtel and Reliance Jio were well-positioned to participate in the 5G auctions, Airtel remains the key beneficiary of the average revenue per user (Arpu) improvement, improved regulatory environment, and organic market share gains. Another upside will come from the scrapping of spectrum usage charges, which will significantly reduce the acquisition cost of fresh spectrum. “We expect Bharti and Jio to participate in the auctions but note that telcos may be selective on the quantum this time given the likely demand-supply imbalance and annual auctions,"" analysts at JP Morgan said in the note. The annual cash outflow is estimated at ₹2,840 crore for each telecom operator for over 20 years, which will impact the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Ebidta) of Vodafone Idea the most and Bharti Airtel the least till March 2025. To mitigate the impact, Arpus would have to be increased by 6% for Vodafone Idea and 3% for Reliance Jio and Airtel, they said. For the quarter ended March, Airtel had an Arpu of ₹178, followed by Jio at ₹168 and Vodafone Idea at ₹124. Analysts, however, cautioned that in the past telcos have bid for more spectrum than expected, so an upcycle in telco capex over FY24-25 could follow from substantial bidding in these auctions and is, therefore, a risk. However, the key issue is captive 5G networks, which may pose a threat to telcos’ enterprise revenue pipeline as most use cases will be enterprise-driven. The government is yet to come up with modalities and pricing of direct spectrum allotment to enterprises. The three telcos had expressed strong views against such allotment. “Enterprises being permitted to directly obtain spectrum to set up captive non-public networks is a more concerning situation given that the 5G opportunity is a play on enterprise solutions rather than retail consumers,"" analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities said. However, a section of experts said the concerns were not well-founded. “Large enterprises will accelerate private network ecosystem and aid growth in telcos’ enterprise business,"" said Sanjesh Jain, vice president, equity research, telecom, media and chemicals, ICICI Securities."

Final bids from interested parties have been called by 8 July. The government has set the base price of 5G airwaves (3300-3600MHz band) at ₹317 crore on a pan-India basis, a 36% reduction from the ₹492 crore it had kept in 2018 when the spectrum remained unsold. “The roads are now clear for the 5G auctions. This is probably one of the most awaited spectrum auctions which will bring significant advancements for the industry and the consumers,"" said Peeyush Vaish, partner and telecom sector leader, Deloitte India. The government has also announced auction of mm Wave band which will not only help in unlocking the true potential of 5G, but will also help strategically manage costs for the operators, he added. Leading carriers Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are key contenders of the airwaves that are critical for introducing the next generation of technology after 4G. Carriers are expected to shell out ₹1 trillion to ₹1.1 trillion in the upcoming auctions, according to ratings agency ICRA. According to the notice inviting applications, the formal document that lays down the auction guidelines and procedures, bidders can apply by 8 July for 72097.85 MHz of spectrum that will be put on sale, including 5G airwaves in the 3300-3600 MHz band. The auction will be held for spectrum in various low (600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz), mid (3300 MHz) and high (26 GHz) frequency bands. “It is expected that the mid and high band spectrum will be utilised by telecom service providers to roll-out of 5G technology-based services capable of providing speed and capacities which would be about 10 times higher than what is possible through the current 4G services,"" the government said in a statement on Wednesday. Telcos will be allowed to share spectrum in a particular band only after one year in the band acquired through the auction. Some key payment relaxations have been made in the payment terms for the 2022 auctions. Spectrum bought in the auction will be allotted for 20 years and payments for spectrum can be made in 20 equal annual instalments. The mandatory requirement to make upfront payment by the successful bidders and submitting a financial bank guarantee equivalent to one annual instalment, have been done away with. Telcos will have an option to pay up front as well. The bidders would be given an option to surrender the spectrum after 10 years with no future liabilities with respect to balance instalments. “This avoids any dent on the liquidity position and is also likely to boost participation. The upfront payment is likely to be close to ₹10,000 crore; adding this to the existing payments, the industry needs to shelve out only ₹17,000 crore annually towards spectrum instalments, till the moratorium ends,"" said Ankit Jain, vice president and sector head, corporate ratings at ICRA. Jain also pointed to an increase in debt levels to around ₹5.7 trillion as on March 31, 2023, before moderating to ₹5.3 trillion by March 31, 2025, even as telcos have been focusing on deleveraging, with Bharti Airtel recently concluding its rights issue of Rs. 21,000 crore and collected 25% as upfront payment, while Vodafone Idea close to raising additional funds of ₹20,000 crore in debt and equity.. The government has further said that no spectrum usage charge will be levied on spectrum bought in the present auctions. The relaxations are expected to significantly ease cash flow requirements and lower the cost of doing business in the sector, the government said. “This is a positive move. SUC paid by operators currently varies between 3-5% of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) depending on the year of acquisition and the 0% SUC will be a welcome relief to operators and enable a faster 5G rollout,"" said Prashant Singhal, global telecom media and technology emerging markets leader at EY. Private 5G networks The Cabinet also decided to enable the development and setting up of private captive networks. The government said this will spur a new wave of innovations in Industry 4.0 applications such as machine to machine communications, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) across automotive, healthcare, agriculture, energy, and other sectors. The government has specified that enterprises setting up captive non-public network may obtain the spectrum on lease from telcos and establish their own isolated network. The department of telecommunications will issue the required licensing terms and conditions, and spectrum leasing guidelines. “Enterprises setting up CNPNs may obtain the spectrum directly from DoT and establish their own isolated network. In this regard, DoT will undertake demand studies and thereafter seek TRAI recommendations for direct assignment of spectrum to such Enterprises,"" the government specified. The move comes as a big blow to telecom service providers that have said that this will distort the level playing field and rob the government of revenues, but will benefit big tech companies like Google and enterprises like TCS have been seeking direct allocation of spectrum for applications such as machine-to-machine communications, IoT and AI. “To boost technological advancement the government has also announced development of private networks which will pave the way for industry 4.0 applications. Together these steps will open up newer avenues for deeper penetration and access, rich user experience via consolidation as well,"" said Deloitte India’s Vaish. The government said in the statement that it will be the responsibility of the telco to ensure that the prescribed QoS or quality of service to their customers through public network is maintained, including interference-free co-existence of the public and private networks. Broadband India Forum, which represents technology companies backing private 5G networks, welcomed the government’s decision, stating that this will lead to better efficiencies, productivity and output for the enterprises, accelerate digitisation, boost capabilities, propel indigenous manufacturing and eventually garner greater economic gains for the country."

The domestic equities also tracked global woes as investors betted cautiously ahead of US Fed and European Central Bank policy. Following this, more than ₹5.16 lakh crore of investors' wealth has been wiped out from Dalal Street. Nearly half of the total losses were seen in the top -10 most valued companies. Life insurance giant LIC was the worst hit. The top two heavyweights Reliance Industries and TCS also took a significant beating. Data on BSE shows that the total equity market capitalisation stood at more than ₹251.84 lakh crore on Friday. From June 6 to 10th, the market cap plunged by ₹5.16 lakh crore. The valuation was a little over ₹257 lakh crore on June 3. Notably, in the past five trading sessions, Sensex nosedived by 1,465.79 points or 2.63%, while Nifty 50 shed 382.5 points or 2.31%. On Friday alone, Sensex dropped by 1,016.84 points or 1.84% and ended at 54,303.44. Nifty 50 closed at 16,201.80 down by 276.30 points or 1.68%. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, ""Rising inflation fears gripped the domestic market leading to heavy sell-off ahead of the release of US inflation data & Fed policy meet next week. The inflation data will be crucial to sense the quantum of a rate hike. European Central Bank in its policy meeting signaled to start rate hike from next month and a large change in September. Persisted foreign fund outflow and widening trade deficit due to the elevated oil prices led to depreciation of INR, weakening the sentiment."" The top ten most valued companies accounted for nearly half of the losses witnessed on Dalal Street. As per a PTI report, the market capitalisation (m-cap) of the top-10 most valued companies eroded by over ₹2.29 lakh crore last week. On BSE, LIC's market cap slipped by a massive ₹57,272.85 crore to ₹4,48,885.09 crore. The insurer holds the seventh rank in the most valued firms list currently on the exchange. Meanwhile, LIC which got listed on May 17, has witnessed a more than ₹1.51 lakh crore decline in market cap against the IPO issue price. At the IPO's upper price band of ₹949 apiece, LIC's market cap before listing stood at ₹6,00,240 crore. Meanwhile, RIL's market cap dipped by ₹44,311.19 crore to ₹18,36,039.28 crore. Furthermore, IT giants TCS and Infosys cumulatively lost a market cap of ₹45,746.13 crore. As of June 10, TCS' market cap stood at ₹12,31,398.85 crore and Infosys at ₹6,21,502.63 crore. At present, in terms of market capitalisation, RIL holds the top spot followed by TCS. HDFC Bank and Infosys hold the third and fourth spots as most valued companies. HDFC Bank's market cap dropped by ₹16,433.92 crore to ₹7,49,880.79 crore, while its peers SBI's market cap contracted by ₹2,231.15 crore to ₹4,12,138.56 crore, and ICICI Bank's market cap slipped by ₹16,305.19 crore to ₹5,00,744.27 crore. ICICI Bank is the sixth most valued company and SBI holds the eighth rank behind LIC. FMCG giant Hindustan Unilever, which is the fifth most valued company, saw its market cap drop by ₹21,674.98 crore to ₹5,16,886.58 crore. Meanwhile, HDFC's valuation fell by ₹17,879.22 crore to ₹3,95,420.14 crore, and telecom giant Bharti Airtel's valuation dipped by ₹7,359.31 crore to ₹3,69,613.44 crore. HDFC and Airtel hold the ninth and tenth rank in the most valued companies list. The order of these top-10 firms on BSE are - RIL, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, Infosys, HUL, ICICI Bank, LIC, SBI, HDFC, and Bharti Airtel Yesha Shah, Head of Equity Research, Samco Securities said, ""Despite the fact that this week's trading patterns suggest additional downside, the overall bearish momentum has moderated as Nifty is currently trading above the falling resistance line. As long as Nifty does not fall below 15,900, there is a significant chance that it can test 16,800 levels. We recommend traders keep a neutral view for the coming week and avoid aggressive trades on either side."" Weekly market outlook: Samco Securities, Head of Equity Research, said, ""Globally, Fed's interest rate decision as well as the volatility in crude price will keep market anxious. Back home, the CPI and WPI inflation print will be the main headliner next week. Markets participants will keenly analyse whether the import duty restrictions and rate hikes have had a positive impact on the inflation numbers."" Furthermore, Shah added, ""statistics on India's trade balance will be closely monitored as this statistic clocked a record high in May 2022. The movement of rupee against the dollar will also be kept an eye on. Amid increasing macro uncertainties, investors are advised to exercise extreme caution till markets decisively find their direction."""
Updated: 09 Jun 2022,Telcos and tech cos at loggerheads on 5G private networks,https://www.livemint.com/industry/telecom/telcos-and-tech-cos-at-loggerheads-on-5g-private-networks-11654767817399.html,"NEW DELHI: Indian telecom operators and the Broadband India Forum (BIF) are at loggerheads over the issue of private entities being allowed to set up captive networks with direct allotment of 5G spectrum. The Forum, comprising members such as Tata Consultancy Services, Amazon, and Meta, among others, has said that private networks are revenue generators for the government and giving out 5G spectrum to set up private networks does not pose a security threat as the networks are closed and disconnected from public telecom networks. In a position paper, Broadband India Forum has emphasised that the government should have a forward-looking approach towards use and advancement of technology, while asking the Centre to earmark certain amount of exclusive spectrum for private 5G networks in each type of spectrum band. “Allow direct allocation of spectrum to enterprises/organisations at nominal administrative fee, as per global best practices,"" it said. “Facilitate a light-touch online portal based paperless regime for acquiring permission/license for ‘Captive Wireless Private Network (CWPN)’ within 30 days of application, (as recommended by Trai) to enable ease of doing business,"" the body led by technology companies has said. It has argued that private 5G networks were best set up by enterprises since public networks cannot deliver the levels of efficiencies required. It added that such networks would make for additional revenue streams for telcos and the government, since they will purchase the spectrum at a price fixed by the government and allocated administratively. The Forum noted that the perception that spectrum can be assigned only through auction is grossly inaccurate and misleading, referring to the Supreme Court guidelines on spectrum allocation issued in 2012. It also said that private 5G networks were not allowed for external communications and the need for lawful monitoring, interceptions and the possibility of threats to national security do not arise at all. Indian telcos, on the other hand, have written to the government against direct allocation of 5G airwaves to private companies as it will adversely impact the enterprise businesses of telecom companies and will leave no business case for the carriers to roll out 5G services. In a communication to telecom minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) which represents Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, has sought the government’s “urgent intervention"" to protect the interest of telcos. The association said giving away dedicated spectrum for private captive networks will hurt the financial health of the industry which is on the path of revival after the government’s relief package last year. “We request your urgent kind intervention in the matter so as to ensure that the interest of the TSPs as well the enterprise segment is efficiently catered to,"" the association said in a letter to the minister on Thursday. This comes in response to private companies such as Tata Consultancy Services seeking direct allocation of 5G spectrum, following recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) that had left it to the government to either license out the airwaves directly or through a leasing model via existing telcos. The telecom department has taken an internal view that telcos were best suited to provide the services to private companies, however a final decision on the matter is yet to be taken. The association had on Wednesday said in a position paper that there was no justification for allocating radiowaves directly to enterprises for operating private captive networks, and that licensed telecom companies are fully capable of providing all customised solutions in the most competitive and economic manner. “If independent entities set up private captive networks with direct 5G spectrum allotment by DoT, the business case of TSPs (telecom service providers) will get severely degraded... This will diminish the revenue so much that there will be no viable business case left for the TSPs and there will not remain any need for 5G Networks rollout by TSPs,"" the association said in the letter to the ministry sent on Thursday. “If private captive networks for enterprises are set up independently by other entities then this would mean dramatically altering the industry dynamics and hurting the financial health of the industry and will strike at the very heart of the business case,"" it further stated. The association has said that worldwide, statistically, wherever 5G has been rolled out, any consequent revenue increment has not come from the retail segment but rather only from the enterprise segment. It also argued that revenues of telcos are not going to increase from the retail segment despite very heavy capital investments for rollout of 5G networks, which will get accentuated further because of the high price-sensitivity of the market. “The new segment that would be benefitted by 5G services of the TSPs is the enterprise segment including manufacturing, logistics, education, hospitals, campuses, factories, etc. Our TSP members have also conducted successful 5G trials for many of these use cases in the last one year,"" the association said, noting that with 5G auctions, telcos were targeting the enterprise segment for revenue enhancement."
Updated: 09 Jun 2022,"Sensex jumps 428 pts, Nifty ends above 16,450; RIL, DRL shine, Tata Steel drags",https://www.livemint.com/market/live-blog/share-market-live-updates-sensex-nifty-bse-nse-stock-market-today-09-06-2022-wipro-pnb-vedanta-yes-bank-tata-power-11654738139336.html,"Indian indices on Thursday ended in the green as both the Sensex and Nifty gyrated between gains and losses amid weak Asian trends. Indices remained volatile for most part of the day as investors were worried that aggressive policy tightening by central banks could stifle global economic growth. However, in the noon trade, the indices made smart recovery. European equities slipped ahead of a European Central Bank decision that will put the region’s monetary policy on a path of tightening and help close the gap with global peers. Oil prices hovered near three-month highs on Thursday after parts of Shanghai imposed new Covid-19 lockdown measures. Shares were flat in Japan and South Korea, while it fell in Hong Kong, Australia, and Shanghai.  Indian indices on Thursday closed higher, snapping 4-day losing streak, led by buying support in pharma, energy, and IT stocks.  The Sensex advanced 427.79 points, or 0.78%, to close at 55,320.28, while Nifty50 gained 121.85 points to end at 16,478.10. Sectorally, metal stocks came under heavy selling pressure, while IT, energy, and telecom sectors ended in the green. On the 30-stock index, the most gains were made by Reliance, DRL, Airtel, and TechM, among others, while Tata Steel, UltraTech, and NTPC were among the biggest losers. On Nifty50, DRL, BPCL, and Reliance made the most gains, while Tata Steel, Grasim, and Shree Cement were among the biggest laggards.   Global wealth rose 10.6% last year to reach a record high of $530 trillion in 2021 and is set to continue rising in all regions despite inflationary pressures and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Strong equity markets and a surge in demand for real assets such as property, wine and art drove the increase, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group. About $80 trillion of new wealth is likely to be created over the next five years. “Wealth development is resoundingly resilient, and even against the backdrop of geopolitical turmoil the growth rate will remain positive,"" said Anna Zakrzewski, global leader of BCG’s wealth management arm.   China’s trade growth rebounded in May after anti-virus restrictions that shut down Shanghai and other industrial centers began to ease.   The rupee slipped 13 paise to hit its intra-day record low of 77.81 against the US dollar on Thursday, weighed down by elevated crude oil prices and persistent foreign capital outflows. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 77.74 against the American dollar, then fell further and touched its intra-day record low of 77.81, registering a fall of 13 paise from the last close. On Wednesday, the rupee recovered from its record low to close 10 paise higher at 77.68 against the American currency. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday raised the key interest rate by 50 basis points, the second increase in five weeks, to rein in the rise in prices that it saw continuing to hurt consumers in the near term.   Repo rate hiked further, MPC focused on containing inflation: MPC unanimously voted to further hike policy repo rate by 50bps to 4.9%. It remains focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure inflation is contained within the target while supporting growth. There is a change in the commentary from ‘withdrawal of ultraaccommodative’ stance to ‘withdrawal of accommodative’ and that upside risks to inflation persists, and appear more hawkish. The move reflects reversal of rate action in 2020 and also points towards further rate hikes during the year and get closer towards the pre-pandemic repo rate. No CRR hike: Post CRR hike of 50bps in May (that would have sucked systemic liquidity to the extent of Rs870bn), systemic liquidity has moderated. There was no further hike in CRR. While normalising the pandemic related extraordinary liquidity accommodation, RBI will ensure adequate liquidity to meet the productive requirements. Will trigger further increase in deposit and lending rates: Recently, post repo rate hike in May, MCLRs were hiked by 10-30bps by leading banks. Banks have also raised deposit rates across maturity buckets with peak retail TD rates being at 5.75%. Also, wholesale peak TD rates are in the range of 5.25-5.75% for leading private banks. Now with another 50bps repo rate hike, rates will be further revised upwards.   We believe cloud opportunities will be beneficial for Indian IT service providers given – 1) 51% of IT spending in the areas of application software, infrastructure software, business process services and system infrastructure will shift to public cloud by CY25 (vs 41% in CY22), according to Gartner; 2) worldwide spending on public cloud services to increase from US$411bn in CY21 to US$495bn in CY22 with IaaS expected to grow the fastest (Gartner); and 3) cloud sustainability initiatives to start with leading cloud providers. Surge in cloud adoption could prove to be a growth lever for IT service providers on the back of cloud platforms created by them to help speed up cloud transformation journey of clients, thereby improving the utilisation of cloud capacity subscribed by clients, and thus, translating bookings into revenues for hyperscalers partners. With Indian IT players already building strong partnerships with hyperscalers, we believe pickup in spends on cloud transformation should make Indian IT a key beneficiary as well. Companies like TCS, INFY, HCLT and TECHM have developed strong organic cloud platforms and it is yielding good results. We believe among tier-2 players, MTCL, LTI and PSYS have strong collaborations and are expanding aggressively in cloud opportunities.   A consortium of Apollo Global Management Inc. and Reliance Industries Ltd. has made a binding offer for Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.’s international arm, people with knowledge of the matter said.   Shares of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) continued to decline with the stock hitting a new record low of ₹723 apiece on the BSE in Thursday's afternoon deals. The stock is now about 25% down from its IPO issue price of ₹949.   Our neutral stance on paint industry (and stocks) is intact - a function of our inability and unwillingness to subscribe to BAAP (buy at any price) as believed by some market participants. We actively cover most listed paint stocks. Ratings: ADD - Akzo Nobel; HOLD - Asian Paints, Indigo Paints, Kansai Nerolac; REDUCE - Berger Paints (based on valuation).   Witnessing positive momentum for the 15th straight month, equity mutual funds attracted a net sum of ₹18,529 crore in May amid heightened volatility in stock markets and consistent selling by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs).   The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday allowed credit cards to be linked with the unified payments interface (UPI), which will enable more people to make payments using the popular platform.   Most Asian and European markets fell Thursday as a rally in oil ramped up inflation fears, with top officials warning of more pain to come as the Ukraine war continues to push prices up and put further pressure on the global economy. Buyers on Wall Street were in retreat again after data showed US crude and gasoline stockpiles sank, just as the summer driving season begins and a leading OPEC member warned demand would surge further as China reopens. Adding to the gloom was the OECD's sharp downward revision of its global growth outlook and doubling of its inflation forecast. The glum mood was only slightly offset by ongoing optimism that Beijing's tech crackdown was close to an end.   We estimate 20-22% CAGR in CIF and Receivables over FY22-24. Despite modelling 25 bps MDR reduction (partial recoup through opex), we estimate RoA/RoE to be 5.5-6%/24-26% which was the pre-pandemic metric (adjusted for capital base). We believe that stock price represents overstretched concerns on a) MDR reduction and lack of flexibility to recoup it, b) structural pressure on cost-income/profitability from increased competitive intensity, c) impact on growth from rising scale of the new-age card cos. and BNPL. Being the only listed pure-play credit card issuer with significantly higher profitability than Banks and NBFCs (in good times as well as bad times), SBI Cards would continue to command a premium valuation. Reiterate BUY with 12m PT of Rs1260.   Outstanding credit cards in the system in April grew 20.7% year-on-year to 75.2 million, the highest in the past 25 months, according to Digital Payments tracker report from Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.   Shares of BLS International rallied about 10% to ₹195 apiece on the BSE in Thursday's early session after the company announced the acquisition of business correspondent Zero Mass Private Limited (ZMPL) for ₹120 crore in an all-cash deal.   Notwithstanding the inflation worries, the housing cycle continues to gather strength, said Jefferies, adding that the rising rates are associated with a booming property market and the other way around and rising prices, low inventory and strong affordability imply durability should add ~1ppt/ year to India's GDP growth rate over next 5 years.   The Indian stock market's benchmark Sensex was witnessing volatile trading with negative bias on Thursday dragged by selling pressure in infra, banking, and IT stocks. The 30 stock S&P BSE Sensex was trading 34.73 points or 0.06 per cent down at 54,857.76 points at 11.36 am, against its previous day's close at 54,892.49 points. Earlier, the Sensex started the day in the red at 54,514.17 points and slumped to a low of 54,507.41 points in the early morning trade. The Sensex turned positive in the late morning session rising to a high of 55,010.89 points. The Sensex is trading in the negative for the fifth straight session. The index had lost 214.85 points or 0.39 per cent on Wednesday.   The Indian rupee hit a record low against the U.S. dollar on Thursday as the relentless surge in global crude oil prices raised concerns of a sustained rise in imported inflation, while weakness in domestic shares also hurt. The partially convertible rupee was trading at 77.78/79 per dollar after touching a record low of 77.81. The previous life low of 77.7975 was touched on May 17. Oil prices held firm near 13-week highs on Thursday after China reported stronger-than-expected exports in May, although new Shanghai lockdown restrictions capped gains.   The yen dropped to a new 20-year low versus the dollar on Thursday, and the euro inched higher ahead of a highly-anticipated meeting of the European Central Bank, which should offer insights into its monetary policy tightening plans. The ECB is all but certain to flag an end to its long-running asset purchase programme at the end of this month, and promise a rate hike for July, but the size and pace of its tightening are uncertain.   State-owned CIL on Thursday said that it has floated its maiden tender to import 2.416 million tonnes of coal to ensure adequate supply of the fuel to power plants in the country. The development assumes significance in the wake of the government making all efforts to build up stock of coal to avoid the reoccurrence of power outages, which happened in April on account of shortage of the fossil fuel. ""In a first-ever, Coal India Limited (CIL) on Wednesday floated an international competitive bidding e-tender, seeking bids for import of 2.41,6 million tonnes of coal,"" the company said in a statement.   Shares of AU Small Finance Bank started trading ex-bonus in Thursday's trading session, a day ahead of the record date for its bonus shares issue. AU Small Finance Bank shares plunged nearly 2% to ₹617 apiece on the BSE in today's early deals.   American Airlines and IndiGo have launched a codeshare agreement that allows the former to sell seats on the latter's flights operating on Delhi-Bengaluru and Delhi-Mumbai routes, a statement said on Thursday.   London copper prices crept lower on Thursday ahead of a monetary policy decision by the European Central Bank, although better-than-expected economic data out of top consumer China raised hopes of a demand recovery amid declining inventories. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was down 0.3% at $9,697 a tonne, as of 0518 GMT. The most-traded July copper contract in Shanghai was up 0.1% at 72,800 yuan ($10,885.39) a tonne by the midday break.   Gold prices in India struggled near three-week lows amid firm US bond yields that lower the safe-haven appeal of zero-yielding gold. On MCX, gold futures were flat at ₹51,070 per 10 gram while silver edged up to ₹62,059 per kg. In global markets, gold prices slipped today ahead of key US inflation data, due later this week. Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1,852.21 per ounce, amid firm US 10-year Treasury yields.   Shares of Deepak Nitrite have fallen about 13% in the last five trading sessions amid reports of Gujarat govt issuing closure notice to chemical intermediate maker Deepak Nitrite over Nandesari explosions, on which the stock exchanges have also sought clarification.   The rupee slipped 10 paise to 77.78 against the US dollar in early trade on Thursday, as elevated crude oil prices and persistent foreign capital outflows weighed on investor sentiments. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 77.74 against the American dollar, then lost ground to quote at 77.78, registering a fall of 10 paise from the last close. On Wednesday, the rupee recovered from its record low to close 10 paise higher at 77.68 against the American currency. Rupee is hovering around its lifetime low of 77.78 against the US dollar tracking the strength of the American currency in the overseas market and firm crude oil prices. Rupee opened on a bearish note as crude oil neared USD 125 per barrel, Anil Kumar Bhansali, Head of Treasury, Finrex Treasury Advisors, said.   Indian stock markets' key indices, Sensex and Nifty, opened with minor cuts on Thursday amid subdued global sentiment. The 30 stock S&P BSE Sensex was trading 186.05 points or 0.34 per cent down at 54,706.44 points at 9.38 am. The broader Nifty 50 of the National Stock Exchange was trading 52.50 points or 0.32 per cent down at 16,303.80 points. MRPL rose 3.50 per cent to ₹121.55, Raymond rose 30.20 per cent to ₹1,008.90, Blissgvs, Biocon, and JKIL were among the major Sensex gainers. PhoenixLTD, Deepakni, EmamiLTD, Dwarkesh, and MotilalOFS were among the major Sensex losers.   According to the brokerage firm Sharekhan, the consumer goods sector's Q4FY2022 performance was impacted by a slowdown in consumer demand, which impacted sales volume, and a sharp increase in raw-material prices, which impacted operating profit margin (OPM), after which the brokerage selected good quality stocks like Marico, Tata Consumer Products, HUL, Nestle India, Asian Paints, and Zydus Wellness as top stock picks to buy.   Most companies announced dividends following the Q4 results of the current financial year, but it is important to note that one should look at companies that are virtually debt-free and have a continuous record of paying dividends. As dividends are a wonderful way to make passive income, buying high-quality stocks is a solid strategy. As a consequence, here are three Mahindra group companies that will pay dividends soon.   6 stocks to buy today — 9th June   In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin price today plunged below $31,000 level after rising above the mark in the previous session. The world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency plunged more than 3% and was trading at $30,173. The digital token is down more than 34% so far this year (YTD), and is trading far below its record high of $69,000 it had hit in November last year.   Back in February, when India was still in denial about its brewing inflation challenge, economists at Nomura Holdings Inc. summarized the choices before the monetary authority into three neat boxes. First, they said, there was a 15% probability that the central bank was right to ignore supply-side pressures. But their base case, to which they assigned a 50% likelihood, was that the Reserve Bank of India was wrong and it would have to pivot to containing price increases. They did consider a third possibility to which they gave a fairly significant 35% chance: that the RBI, although wrong about inflation, would simply go on to tolerate it.   Gold inched lower on Thursday, with prices restrained by rising Treasury yields ahead of key U.S. jobs and inflation data this week. FUNDAMENTALS * Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1,852.21 per ounce, as of 0052 GMT, while U.S. gold futures also eased 0.1% to $1,853.90. * Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields firmed on Thursday, lowering the appeal of zero-yield gold.  * SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings rose 0.22% to 1,065.39 tonnes on Wednesday from 1,063.06 tonnes on Tuesday.   Asian stocks fell, U.S. bond yields rose and a soaring dollar pushed to a two-decade high against the yen on Thursday as investors worried about the outlook for more rate rises ahead of a key meeting of the European Central Bank later in the day. But before the meeting, at which the ECB is set to bring to an end its Asset Purchase Programme and signal rate hikes to combat rising inflation, moves in the Asian session were relatively muted as many investors kept to the sidelines.   Indian economy is projected to cross $5 trillion in 2026-27 and likely to become $20 trillion by 2040, Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said on Wednesday.   The top US securities regulator on Wednesday unveiled a planned overhaul of Wall Street retail stock trading rules, aiming to boost competition for handling orders by commission-free brokerages to ensure mom-and-pop investors get the best price for trades. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler said he wants to require trading firms to directly compete to execute trades from retail investors. The Wall Street watchdog plans to scrutinize growth in recent years of the payment for order flow (PFOF) practice, which is banned in Canada, the UK and Australia.   US stocks fell on Wednesday as Treasury yields rose above the psychologically important 3% level and oil prices jumped, fanning worries about inflation and the outlook for interest rates. The S&P 500 ended down more than 1% in the broad sell-off, snapping a two-day winning streak. Among its biggest drags, shares of Intel Corp slid 5.3% after Citi cut its estimates on the chipmaker for the second time in a week. Citi pointed to uncertainty about demand for personal computers and predicted the company could pre-announce weaker-than-expected earnings for the second quarter. Other chip shares also fell. Brent crude oil prices rose above $123 a barrel and hit a 13-week high, while the Dow Jones transportation average fell 3.8%, significantly underperforming the other main indexes on the day. The S&P 500 energy sector was the only sector to end higher.   Tokyo stocks trended higher Thursday, with a lower yen buoying exporters despite overnight falls of US shares. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.22 percent, or 61.85 points, at 28,296.14, while the broader Topix index rose 0.24 percent, or 4.67 points, to 1,974.65. The yen's weakness against major currencies continued to provide solid support for shares of Tokyo exporters, analysts said, although the overall market could take a breather after recent gains. The dollar stood at 134.41 yen, around a 20-year high, against 134.29 yen overnight in New York. Wall Street shares fell on lingering worries about inflation while US yields trended higher.   Hong Kong stocks rose at the start of trade Thursday morning as another pick-up in tech firms helped traders brush off a drop on Wall Street. The Hang Seng Index rose 0.49 percent, or 106.94 points, to 22,121.53. The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.13 percent, or 4.30 points, to 3,259.49, while the Shenzhen Composite Index on China's second exchange slipped 0.24 percent, or 5.03 points, to 2,078.39.   Stocks wavered in Asia on Thursday and bonds were again on the back foot, weighed down by the impact of high inflation. Equities were mixed in Japan and fell in Australia and South Korea. Hong Kong may offer a modicum of relief from an ongoing rally in Chinese tech shares that’s predicated on an easing regulatory crackdown and loosening Covid curbs. US futures fluctuated after Wall Street snapped a two-day rally on a climb in oil past $122 a barrel that stoked worries about rising costs and monetary tightening. Benchmark Treasury yields held above 3% and New Zealand’s 10-year yield touched the highest level in seven years. The dollar-yen pair is dominating foreign-exchange markets, with the weakness in Japan’s currency putting the 2002 high of 135.15 in play. Markets remain fixated on the risk of a downturn triggered by interest-rate hikes across much of the world to quell price pressures. The OECD added to the gloom with a warning that the global economy will pay a “hefty price"" for Russia’s war in Ukraine in the form of weaker growth, stronger inflation and potentially long-lasting damage to supply chains.

Updated: 09 Jun 2022,No case for allocation to pvt networks: COAI,https://www.livemint.com/industry/telecom/no-case-for-allocation-to-pvt-networks-coai-11654705660970.html,"Telecom service providers have urged the government not to reserve or de-license any spectrum, which has been identified or is likely to be identified for use of mobile services, towards private networks ahead of upcoming 5G auctions. In a position paper the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) that represents carriers such as Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea, said that there was no justification for allocating airwaves directly to enterprises for operating private networks. It said licenced telecom companies are fully capable of providing all customised solutions in the most competitive and economic manner. This comes in response to private companies such as Tata Consultancy Services seeking direct allocation of 5G spectrum, following recommendations by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) that had left it to the government to licence out the airwaves either directly or through a leasing model via existing telcos. The telecom department has taken an internal view that telcos were best suited to providing services to private companies. However a final decision is yet to be taken. “Any de-licencing/reservation of spectrum for Industrial use/establishment of private captive networks, as demanded by a few companies, would not only cause huge loss to the exchequer but will also lead to sub-optimal utilization of this scarce resource. Hence, such a move is not only technically uncalled for but also legally untenable,"" the association said. At present, all airwaves are sold through auctions conducted by the government."

After a weak start, the indices turned positive but, soon after, they gave up gains to end in the red. European markets opened mostly lower on Wednesday after gains in Asia as investors awaited greater clarity on where interest rates, inflation and economies are heading. Oil extended gains from the highest close in three months as the US summer driving season ramps up and China emerges from virus lockdowns.   Indian indices on Wednesday closed lower, extending run of losses, dragged by heavy selling pressure in market heavyweights Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, and ITC as RBI's monetary policy committee decided to increase repo rate by 50 bps to 4.9%. The Sensex fell 214.85 points, or 0.39%, to close at 54,892.49, while Nifty50 declined 60.10 points to end at 16,356.25. Sectorally, telecom, energy, FMCG, and power stocks, among others, came under selling pressure, while PSU banks and realty stocks received buying support. On the 30-stock index, the most gains were made by Tata Steel, SBI, DRL, and Bajaj Finance, among others, while Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, and ITC were among the biggest losers. On Nifty50, Tata Steel, SBI, and Titan made the most gains, while Airtel, ITC, RIL, and UPL were among the biggest laggards.   After more than a year of pressure from the United States and other top oil consuming countries, OPEC+ finally agreed to accelerate oil supply increases last week to tame runaway fuel prices and slow inflation. But that will leave producers with very little spare capacity, and almost no room to compensate for a major supply outage. Tight spare capacity is likely to keep oil prices volatile and sensitive to any disruptions in output, such as a big hit from a hurricane to Gulf of Mexico production during the Atlantic storm season, or a further fall in exports from sanctions-hit Russia. The most conservative estimates forecast OPEC's spare capacity dropping to below 1 million barrels per day (bpd) later this year, representing about 1% of global demand and barely one twentieth of U.S. demand. Only a handful of OPEC producers, namely Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have any meaningful spare capacity.   Aluminium prices on Wednesday increased by 0.96 per cent to ₹237.35 per kilogram in futures trade as speculators built up fresh positions amid a positive trend in spot market. On the Multi Commodity Exchange, aluminium contracts for June delivery increased by ₹2.25 or 0.96 per cent to ₹237.35 per kg in a business turnover of 2,717 lots. Analysts said fresh positions created by traders amid demand from consumer industries, supported aluminium prices in futures market.   Cottonseed oil cake prices on Wednesday declined by ₹15 to ₹2,841 per quintal in futures trade as participants reduced their bets tracking a weak trend in spot market. On the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange, cottonseed oil cake for June delivery fell by ₹15 or 0.53 per cent to ₹2,841 per quintal with an open interest of 52,460 lots. Analysts said sell-off by participants at existing levels amid subdued trend in market mainly weighed on cottonseed oil cake prices.   Copper prices on Wednesday increased by 0.19 per cent to ₹796.85 per kilogram in the futures market on the back of higher spot demand. On the Multi Commodity Exchange, copper contracts for delivery in June traded higher by ₹1.50 or 0.19 per cent at ₹796.85 per kg in a business turnover of 3,717 lots. Analysts attributed the rise in copper prices to the raising of bets by participants.   Crude oil prices on Wednesday rose by ₹176 to ₹9,345 per barrel as participants widened positions on a firm spot demand. On the Multi Commodity Exchange, crude oil for June delivery traded higher by ₹176 or 1.92 per cent at ₹9,345 per barrel in 12,805 lots.

Analysts said after tracking firm physical market trend, traders raised their bets which led to the rise in guar gum prices.   European markets opened mostly lower Wednesday after a day of gains in Asia as investors awaited greater clarity on where interest rates, inflation and economies are heading. Germany's DAX slipped 0.3% to 14,517.96 while the CAC 40 in Paris shed 0.2% to 6,489.76. Britain's FTSE 100 was little changed at 7,602.22. The futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials were 0.4% lower. “Equities are drifting lower as the broader narrative remains unchanged, with peak inflation optimism meeting increasingly hawkish pivots from central banks,"" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. In Asian trading, Hong Kong shares surged 2.2% to 22,014.59 on heavy buying of shares in Chinese technology companies after Beijing approved a new batch of video games. That was seen as a sign the business outlook for tech companies is improving after a prolonged regulatory crackdown. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 1% to 28,234.29 after Japan reported its economy contracted at a lower pace than earlier reported in the January-March quarter, shrinking 0.5% instead of 1%. The latest data showed consumer spending was not as weak as earlier thought.   European stocks slipped on Wednesday and Wall Street futures were in the red as worries that central bank tightening will stifle global growth weighed on markets. The World Bank on Tuesday slashed its global growth forecast by nearly a third to 2.9% for 2022, warning of a period of ""feeble growth and elevated inflation"", and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told senators that she expected inflation to remain high. Although Asian stocks strengthened overnight following Wall Street gains, market sentiment was volatile and European indexes were mostly down.   The brokerage company Sharekhan has maintained its positive stance on pharma stocks, despite the fact that Q4FY2022 was a poor quarter for pharmaceutical companies, plagued by higher cost pressures as increased raw material costs and freight costs pulled down profitability.   The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday raised the limit for auto-debit mandates on recurring payments done through cards and UPI (Unified Payment Interface) to ₹15,000 from ₹5,000.   The picture is not pretty for investors in paint stocks amid rising competition and persistently high input cost inflation. The exact impact of the former on incumbents is yet to be known. As far as the latter is concerned, companies have taken several rounds of price hikes in FY22 to contain gross margin erosion.   Mutual funds: Maintaining its hawkish stance on interest rate hike, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today announced to raise the repo rate by 50 bps leaving CRR unchanged. After this RBI policy announcement, investment experts are well convinced that Indian central bank's stance on inflation and interest rate is going to remain hawkish for short to medium term, which may require some tweak in one's mutual funds portfolio, especially in debt funds. They said that debt funds with short term view (not more than two year), should be preferred ahead of equity funds as ultra short and short term debt funds are expected to outperform equity mutual funds in upcoming 6 months to two years.   The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to raise the repo rate by 50 bps to 4.9 per cent during its monetary policy meeting on June 8, 2022, following a 40-basis-point rise on May 4, 2022. The outcome will have a direct impact on loan borrowers who are intending to take out a car loan, a home loan, a personal loan or a gold loan in the near future since banks and NBFCs are anticipated to raise lending rates. Borrowers would have to pay higher EMIs as loans become more costly on the back of a rise in the repo rate.   Drug maker Lupin on Wednesday said it has received tentative approval from the US health regulator to market Ivacaftor tablets, used to treat cystic fibrosis, in America. The company has received tentative approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for its abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for Ivacaftor tablets, 150 mg strength, Lupin said in a statement. The product is the generic equivalent of Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Kalydeco tablets, it added. The product will be manufactured at the company's Nagpur facility, the Mumbai-based drug maker said. As per IQVIA MAT March 2022 data, Ivacaftor tablets had estimated annual sales of USD 109 million in the US.   The monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) did what was expected of it and raised the repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.9%. Repo rate is the interest rate at which the RBI lends to banks. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage. The hike is expected to push up interest rates in the overall economy and thus dampen demand and help control inflation.   The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has issued directions to ban the use of coal in industrial, domestic and other miscellaneous applications in the entire Delhi-NCR region from January 1, 2023.   London copper prices edged lower on Wednesday, pressured by a firmer dollar, although demand optimism due to the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in top consumer China and declining inventories offered support. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was down 0.2% at $9,680 a tonne, as of 0717 GMT. The most-traded July copper contract in Shanghai ended daytime trading up 0.1% at 72,790 yuan ($10,911.24) a tonne.   The 50bps repo rate hike comes on the back of persistence of elevated inflation and the continued upside risks. Given that inflation is expected to remain above 6% through 3QFY23 , RBI has to frontload actions. We continue to see another 60-85bps hike in rest of FY23 to manage inflationary expectations.   On the expected lines, RBI unanimously re-emphasized its endeavour to contain inflation through withdrawal of the accommodative stance and normalisation of the policy rates. 50bps hike in the repo rate was very much factored in the 10yr yields which moved above 7.5% before the policy outcome, only to retreat lower to 7.45%. Markets are taking respite from the fact that the central bank did not move on the CRR hike, as feared earlier. On inflation, RBI now sees CPI average for FY23 to 6.7%, 100bps higher than the earlier estimate, with the revision primarily attributed to food prices. CPI inflation is likely to remain above the tolerance level of 6% till December 2022 and fall to 5.8% in Q4 FY23. RBI emphasized that the recent fiscal measures have moderated the inflation expectations. However, the inflation projection seemed to be a conservative one, as it assumes Oil to have peaked out and monsoon rainfall to be a normal one. So, the CPI projections are subject to revisions, depending on the magnitude of the supply-side risks. On growth, RBI retains GDP growth for FY23 at 7.2%, emphasising improving aggregate demand and capacity utilization in manufacturing. On the policy rate outlook, the pronounced priority to combat inflation has paved the path for further rate hikes, with the repo rate seen proximal to 5.75% by the end of FY23.   In the light of the uncertainty of persisting geopolitical tensions, concerns over rising global inflation and escalation in global crude oil prices and other commodities, we had expected the RBI to hike interest rates in consonance with the recent off-cycle policy meeting. The RBI has further hiked the repo rate by 50bps to 4.9% and will be focused on 'withdrawal of accommodation' to ensure inflation remains within target going forward while supporting growth. RBI further retained its FY23 GDP forecast at 7.2% on the back of recovery in urban demand and improving rural demand conditions along with expectations of normal monsoon. The push from the government on capex and increase in capacity utilization is likely to bolster well domestic economic activity. The RBI has also reiterated that they will ensure adequate liquidity in the banking system for productive purposes of the economy. We are optimistic that with pick up in both urban and rural demand, there will be a pick-up in demand for gold loans in the industry in the upcoming quarters.   Oil prices drifted higher on Wednesday, anticipating a report of low U.S. oil stocks, while expectations of solid demand in the upcoming driving season also lent support. Brent crude futures for August were up 40 cents, or 0.3%, at $120.97 a barrel at 0649 GMT after closing on Tuesday at the highest since May 31. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for July was at $120.01 a barrel, up 60 cents, or 0.5%, after reaching its highest settlement since March 8 in the previous session. Analysts polled by Reuters expect data for last week to show another drawdown of U.S. crude inventories, although gasoline and distillates stocks could edge higher. ""The oil market is expected to remain tight as the supply side will continue to tell a story of low inventories. Crude oil inventories will likely post more draws as driving season and vacationing heats up,"" OANDA analyst Edward Moya said in a note.   Bonds in India rallied, led by the short-end after the monetary authority refrained from withdrawing cash from the banking system and assured markets it would support the government’s record-borrowing program. The yield on four-year bonds fell as much as 15 basis points to 7.12% while the 10-year debt also declined by eight basis points to 7.44%. Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das said the central bank would take all steps needed to ensure an orderly completion of the borrowing plan, without giving details. “Gains on the shorter end are more because now traders are not expecting rates to be hiked at as fast a pace as the last three months,"" said Vijay Sharma, senior executive vice president at PNB Gilts. “It was a hawkish policy, but slightly less than what the market was expecting."" Yields on benchmark 10-year bonds hit a three-year high this week amid surging crude prices and a renewed rise in US yields. They are already up over 100 basis points this year. New Delhi plans to sell a record 14.31 trillion rupees of bonds this fiscal year.   Shares were mostly higher in Asia on Wednesday after U.S. stocks rallied on heavy buying of technology companies. Advancing Chinese technology shares also pushed Hong Kong sharply higher. Benchmarks likewise rose in other regional markets. Oil prices remained near $120 per barrel. Investors are waiting for more clarity on where interest rates, inflation and economies are heading. Japan's economy contracted at a 0.5% annual rate in the first quarter amid a major outbreak of coronavirus, the Cabinet Office reported. That was smaller than the 1.0% contraction in the preliminary estimate. The latest data showed consumer spending and other private demand was not as weak as earlier thought. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index gained 1% to 28,234.29 while the Kospi in South Korea was little changed at 2,626.14. In Sydney, the S&P/ASX 200 advanced 0.4% to 7,121.10. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped 2.1% to 21,987.92 as Chinese technology stocks surged after Beijing approved a new batch of video games. That was seen as a sign the business outlook for tech companies is improving after a prolonged regulatory crackdown. The Shanghai Composite index reversed early losses, gaining 0.5% to 3,259.24.   Reserve Bank of India (RBI) retained the real GDP projection of 7.2 per cent for the year FY 2022-23. Addressing a press conference following a three-day meeting of the RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on Wednesday announced that the inflation is now projected at 6.7 per cent. ""RBI has retained the real GDP projection of 7.2 per cent for the year FY 2022-23. With Q1 at 16.2 per cent, Q2 6.2 per cent, Q3 at 4.1 per cent and Q4 at 4 per cent with risk broadly balanced,"" the RBI Governor said in a press conference here. Citing the provisional estimates released by the National Statistical Office on May 31, Das said India's GDP growth ins 2021-22 is estimated at 8.7 per cent which has exceeded the pre-pandemic, that is, 2019-20 level. With the assumption of a normal monsoon, in 2022 and the average crude oil price in the Indian basket of 105 dollars per barrel, the RBI Governor said inflation is now projected at 6.7 per cent in 2022-23. ""Limits for individual housing loans extended by urban cooperative banks and rural cooperative banks, last fixed in 2011 and 2009 respectively, being revised upwards by over 100 per cent taking into account increase in house prices. It'll facilitate a better flow of credit to the housing sector,"" he said.   India's benchmark 10-year bond yield briefly jumped to 7.562%, its highest since March 14, 2019, before trading at 7.50% after the policy decision. The rupee was at 77.6925 against the dollar. ""The 50-bp repo rate hike comes on the back of persistently elevated inflation and continued upside risks,"" said Upasna Bhardwaj, chief economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank. ""Given that inflation is expected to remain above 6% through 3QFY23, the RBI has to front-load actions. We continue to see another 60-85 bp hikes in rest of FY23 to manage inflationary expectations.""   As expected, the repo rate was hiked by 50 bps to 4.90%. After the commentary of the RBI governor last month, the market has already expected a rate hike of 50bps in the June meeting. So now the RBI has taken a decision on the rate hike of 50bps. We believe that this rate hike is already priced in the market. Along with this bank, rates have also increased by 50bps to 5.15%, and withdrawal of the accommodative stance for the Indian economy. A good takeaway for the market is that RBI has retained the GDP forecast of 7.2% for FY2023 and CPI inflation is expected to be at 6.7% for FY2023. Overall the policy is in the expectation of the market, a 50bps rate hike is already priced in the market now the market focus will be on the Fed rate hike.   India's central bank on Wednesday hiked rates for a second time, as Asia's third-largest economy reels from galloping inflation in the wake of the Ukraine war. The Reserve Bank of India raised its key repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.90 percent, a month after kicking off an aggressive monetary tightening cycle with a surprise 0.4 percentage point lift in May. ""The war in Europe is lingering and we are facing newer challenges each passing day,"" Bank governor Shaktikanta Das said in a televised address, pointing to higher food and fuel prices. He added that inflation was a global problem but emerging economies were facing ""bigger challenges"", with market turbulence following monetary policy shifts in advanced economies.   The Reserve Bank of India's key interest rate was raised by 50 basis points on Wednesday as widely expected, in the second hike in as many months, in a bid to cool persistently high inflation. The monetary policy committee (MPC) raised the key lending rate or the repo rate by 50 basis points (bps) to 4.90%. The Standing Deposit Facility rate and the Marginal Standing Facility Rate were adjusted higher by the same quantum to 4.65% and 5.15%, respectively. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said a June 8 move was a ""no brainer"". But analysts polled by Reuters had been divided over how much it would hike, with forecasts ranging between 25 and 75 bps. Wednesday's increase follows a 40-bps rise in early May at an unscheduled meeting that kicked off the central bank's tightening cycle, which economists expect to be relatively short. ""Upside risks to inflation as highlighted in last policy meetings have materialized earlier than expected,"" Das said after the policy decision. He said inflation will likely remain above the RBI's upper tolerance band in the first three quarters of the financial year that started on April 1. Retail inflation in April accelerated to 7.79% from a year earlier, above the RBI's tolerance band for inflation of 2% to 6% for a fourth month in a row, and a further rise in global prices of crude oil, food and other commodities is expected to keep up the upward pressure. The price spikes have hammered consumer spending and darkened the near-term outlook for India's economic growth, which slowed to the lowest in a year in the first three months of 2022. India's central bank maintained its growth projection at 7.2% for 2022/23.   RBI retains FY23 GDP growth forecast at 7.2%   The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will be announcing the outcome of its June policy meeting today and Governor Shaktikanta Das is widely expected to increase the repo rate again to contain soaring inflation, after an off-cycle hike last month.   The rupee strengthened by 9 paise to 77.69 against the US dollar in opening trade on Wednesday, ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy decision. A weak trend in domestic equities, surging crude oil prices and unabated foreign fund outflows capped the appreciation bias of the rupee, forex dealers said. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is slated to announce its policy decision later in the day. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened strong at 77.70 against the US dollar, then gained further ground to quote 77.69, registering a rise of 9 paise over the last close. In the previous session, the rupee had closed at a record 77.78 against the US dollar.   Amid rising inflation concerns in the economy, all eyes are on today's Monetary Policy Meeting outcome as experts believe that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to increase the repo rate by 25 to 50 basis points (BPS). RBI will announce the credit policy at 10 am today.   Indian shares swung between gains and losses on Wednesday ahead of a widely expected rate hike decision by the central bank, which is trying to bring down inflation from an eight-year high while also keeping an eye on slowing economic growth. The NSE Nifty 50 index was down 0.06% at 16,411.20, as of 0349 GMT, while the S&P BSE Sensex fell 0.03% to 55,094.84. After an unscheduled 40 basis point repo rate hike in May to 4.40%, economists polled by Reuters expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to raise it by 25 to 75 basis points on Wednesday.   4 stocks to buy today — 8th June   Share price of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) slumped to a new record low of ₹751 on Tuesday, which is over 20 per cent down from its IPO issue price of ₹949. At the BSE, Life Insurance Corporation of India's shares closed 3.15 per cent down at ₹752.90 against its previous day's close at ₹777.40. LIC share price hit a record low of ₹751 in the intra-day. The scrip also hit a record closing low of ₹752.90. There has been a consistent decline in the share price of the government-run insurer. Life Insurance Corporation of India shares got listed on the stock exchanges on May 17. Since its listing, the scrip has closed in the positive four sessions. For the rest of the days, it witnessed selling pressure.   The World Bank on Tuesday cut India's economic growth forecast for the current fiscal to 7.5 per cent as rising inflation, supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions taper recovery. This is the second time that the World Bank has revised its GDP growth forecast for India in the current fiscal 2022-23 (April 2022 to March 2023). In April, it had trimmed the forecast from 8.7 per cent to 8 per cent and now it is projected at 7.5 per cent. The GDP growth compares to an 8.7 per cent expansion in the previous 2021-22 fiscal. ""In India, growth is forecast to edge down to 7.5 percent in the fiscal year 2022/23, with headwinds from rising inflation, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical tensions offsetting buoyancy in the recovery of services consumption from the pandemic,"" the World Bank said in its latest issue of the Global Economic Prospects.   The global economy is on track to grow by 2.9 percent in 2022, down 1.2 percentage points from the January projection, the World Bank Group said in its latest Global Economic Prospects released on Tuesday, warning of stagflation risk. Compounding the damage from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war has magnified the slowdown in the global economy, which is entering what could become a protracted period of feeble growth and elevated inflation, the report said. This raises the risk of stagflation, with potentially harmful consequences for middle- and low-income economies alike, according to the report. Global growth is expected to slump from 5.7 per cent in 2021 to 2.9 per cent in 2022 and hover around that pace over 2023-2024, the report showed.   The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to hike the policy repo rate by 40 basis points to 4.80 per cent on Wednesday and increase the inflation forecast for the current fiscal to above 6 per cent from its earlier projection of 5.7 per cent, according to market analysts and economists. The six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the RBI is certain to hike the policy interest rates as inflation has remained above the central bank's tolerance limit for the past several months. In a recent interview, RBI Governor Das said that the expectation of rate hikes in June is a ""no-brainer"". While the rate hike is certain, as RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had indicated last month, the question remains on by how much? ""We expect the RBI to hike repo rate by 40 bps in the June policy meeting. However, we should be open for a rate hike between 35-50 bps hinging on how the MPC wants to reach the pre-pandemic repo rate of 5.15 per cent or around that mark by the end of August policy,"" said Suvodeep Rakshit, Senior Economist at Kotak Institutional Equities. Last month, in its off-cycle monetary policy review the central bank hiked the policy repo rate by 40 basis points or 0.40 per cent to 4.4 per cent. This was the first increase in the policy repo rate in nearly two years. The repo rate is the interest rate at which the RBI lends short-term funds to banks. Inflation has been above the RBI's 2-6 per cent target band since the beginning of this year.As per the latest available data, India's Consumer Price Index (CPI) based inflation surged to an eight-year high of 7.79 per cent in April. It has been above 6 per cent since January 2022.   Gold prices were little changed on Wednesday as investors awaited the U.S. inflation report this week for further cues on the economy as central banks worldwide seek to cool surging prices. FUNDAMENTALS * Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1,850.41 per ounce, as of 0037 GMT, while U.S. gold futures added 0.1% to $1,853.30. * The World Bank on Tuesday slashed its global growth forecast by nearly a third to 2.9% for 2022, warning that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has compounded the damage from the COVID-19 pandemic, and many countries now faced recession. * The U.S. trade deficit narrowed by the most in nearly 9-1/2 years in April as exports jumped to a record high, putting trade on course to contribute to economic growth this quarter.   Oil prices edged up on Wednesday ahead of data on U.S. oil inventories, with crude futures supported by tight supplies and recovering fuel demand as China's top cities relax COVID-19 curbs. Brent crude futures for August rose 22 cents, or 0.2%, to $120.79 a barrel by 0012 GMT after closing at the highest since May 31 on Tuesday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for July was at $119.65 a barrel, up 24 cents, or 0.2%, after reaching its highest settlement since March 8 on Tuesday. Analysts polled by Reuters expect another drawdown of U.S. crude inventories in data for last week although gasoline and distillates stocks could edge higher.   U.S. stocks rallied Tuesday as Treasury yields eased, but Wall Street remains wobbly as investors wait for more clarity on where interest rates, inflation and the economy are heading. The S&P 500 climbed 39.25 points, or 1%, to 4,160.68 after reversing a morning loss of 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 264.36 points, or 0.8%, to 33,180.14 after it also bounced between losses and gains throughout the day. The Nasdaq composite gained 113.86 points, or 0.9%, to 12,175.23. Gains by Apple, Microsoft and other technology stocks were some of the biggest forces lifting the market. They benefited from a drop in Treasury yields, with the 10-year yield falling back below 3%. Lower yields in recent years have emboldened investors to pay higher prices for stocks, particularly companies that are growing quickly. Stocks of energy producers also jumped as oil prices rose to roughly $120 per barrel, up more than 55% for the year so far. Exxon Mobil climbed 4.6%, and ConocoPhillips added 4.5%.   Tokyo stocks opened higher on Wednesday, tracking Wall Street rallies, with a cheap yen giving some support to exporters. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was up 0.61 percent, or 169.99 points, at 28,113.94, while the broader Topix index was up 0.45 percent, or 8.71 points, at 1,955.74. Investors in Tokyo ""are likely to test the ceiling of today's trade"" and actively buy after rallies on Wall Street, Okasan Online Securities said in a note. ""A sense of short-term overheating will be offset by the yen's depreciation against the dollar,"" it added. The dollar fetched 132.80 in early Asian trade, against 132.62 yen in New York late Tuesday.   Hong Kong shares started Wednesday with a big gain following a strong lead from Wall Street, with tech firms again seeing huge buying interest on hopes a long-running crackdown on the sector by China is coming to an end. The Hang Seng Index jumped 1.19 percent, or 257.22 points, to 21,788.89. The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.10 percent, or 3.25 points, to 3,245.02, while the Shenzhen Composite Index on China's second exchange ticked up 0.06 percent, or 1.30 points, to 2,073.88.   Stocks in Asia rose Wednesday after gains in US equities and as a pullback in bond yields provided some respite for investors fretting that higher rates will slow down growth. An MSCI Inc. gauge of Asia-Pacific shares advanced led by Hong Kong and Japan. China was little changed. US futures slipped after the S&P 500 wiped out last week’s losses with back-to-back advances and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 also climbed. Treasury yields edged higher. The long end of the Treasury curve led a rally, pushing 10-year yields below the 3% level and flattening the curve as Target Corp.’s latest profit forecast underscored a grim outlook for US consumer spending. Shorter-dated maturities lagged, weighed by weak demand at an auction. A dollar gauge rose, while the yen dipped further after sliding to a 20-year low.  "
Updated: 06 Jun 2022,Vi looks to grow postpaid user base,https://www.livemint.com/industry/telecom/vi-looks-to-grow-postpaid-user-base-11654455887887.html,"Vodafone Idea Ltd plans to grow its postpaid user base and add more high-paying customers to its network through targeted marketing initiatives as part of its broader strategy to boost its average revenue per user. Ravinder Takkar, chief executive, Vodafone Idea, said the key challenge of payment mechanism for postpaid plans through online mode has been resolved and the time is ripe to examine the prepaid-postpaid divide within its customer base. “We are working on something which will help clarify that (distinction), which will explain (to consumers the benefits of both plans) in a slightly different manner than we have in the past because we believe there’s an opportunity to get rid of postpaid-prepaid distinction and provide the right package for you that fits your lifestyle better,"" Takkar said in a recent interview. “Back in the day, say 10 years ago, it was a payment mechanism issue. Now, as an industry, we can do a better job of explaining to customers the benefit of being a postpaid customer versus a prepaid customer and vice versa,"" he added. The change in strategy comes at a time when the debt-ladden carrier is seeking to raise ₹20,000 crore from external investors in debt and equity. It is also awaiting final approval for conversion of interest on moratorium of its spectrum related dues, into equity, which will make the government the largest shareholder in the company. Vodafone Idea’s pre-paid subscribers accounted for 91.8%, or 223.8 million, of the total 243.8 million users, as of March. A year earlier, its pre-paid base was 92.2% (246.9 million) of its customer base of 267.8 million. According to its March quarter report, the telco’s postpaid subscriber count fell from 20.9 million in FY21 to 20 million in FY22. However, despite the drop in postpaid user base, it leads Bharti Airtel’s 18 million as of March. Airtel’s prepaid base is at 94.5% of its more than 326 million customers. Experts said Vodafone Idea’s move could herald the start of an industry trend since the issue of making physical payments for postpaid plans had been done away with the rapid adoption of online payment systems offered by banks, carriers’ own apps or third-party apps that offer either incentives, rewards, or cashbacks for paying phone bills online. Vodafone Idea’s prepaid plans with unlimited calls, 1.5 GB data per day and Vi movies, start at ₹299. Its postpaid plans, starting at ₹399 a month offer 40 GB data, unlimited calls, 200 GB roll over data and 150 GB extra data if a recharge is done online. The 20-25% tariff hikes last November for prepaid users, and imminent tariff hikes in FY23 may close the gap between prepaid and postpaid tariffs, an expert said. “The gap between prepaid and postpaid isn’t much these days, so if Vodafone Idea is able to convert some prepaid users to postpaid, it will help the loss-making telecom operator to improve its financial position as well, vis-a-vis competition,"" the person said, seeking anonymity."
Updated: 03 Jun 2022,"Bharti Airtel shares are Jefferies' top pick, sees strong upside on the stock ",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/stocks-to-buy-jefferies-sees-over-28-upside-on-bharti-airtel-shares-11654238840933.html,"The tariff hike is driving strong revenue and Ebitda growth in the telecom sector. Analysts at Jefferies believe that Bharti Airtel is the best way to play rising mobile tariffs in India and remains the brokerage's top stock pick in the sector.  The brokerage has Buy rating on Bharti Airtel shares with a SOTP-based price target of ₹880 apiece, implying a potential upside of about 28% from current stock level. Though, key risks as per Jefferies are delays in tariff hikes, Vodafone Idea's (Vi) fundraising and potential overspending on spectrum. In 4QFY22, revenues of Top-3 telcos rose by 8% on a sequential basis, led by Bharti Airtel, which gained 60 basis points (bps) market share. Tariff hikes drove a 8-11% QoQ average revenue per user (ARPU) uptick, while pickup in gross adds indicates acceptance of tariff hikes.  The management commentary around pricing remains encouraging and further tariff hikes would drive strong revenue/ Ebitda growth for the sector, the note highlighted. A pick-up in gross subscriber adds for all three telcos was a key positive from the quarter, indicating acceptance of tariff hikes. Churn levels were also steady, with Bharti witnessing some moderation in churn.  Bharti Airtel was the only telco to gain subscribers adding 3 million net subscribers in the quarter, while both Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea witnessed 3-11 m decline in subscribers base in 4Q. ARPU rose by 8-11% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) for the three telcos and have increased by 14-17% over the last two quarters. Jefferies expects Arpus to further benefit from residual impact of the 20% tariff hikes in subsequent quarters. While SIM consolidation is impacting net subscriber adds, there is a wider acceptance of new tariffs. Management commentary around tariffs remains encouraging as the focus is now on market expansion rather than market share gains. The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint."
Updated: 01 Jun 2022,‘VI won’t hesitate to lead next round of tariff hikes’,https://www.livemint.com/industry/telecom/vi-won-t-hesitate-to-lead-next-round-of-tariff-hikes-11654016903997.html,"NEW DELHI : Vodafone Idea Ltd won’t hesitate to lead the next round of tariff hikes, chief executive officer and managing director Ravinder Takkar said, as India’s third-largest telco aims to achieve average revenue per user (Arpu) levels of ₹350-400 over the next three to five years. Taking into account inflation since 2016, current Arpu levels are far lower than what they should be, Takkar said in an interview. According to him, while telecom services have become critical, the share of customer wallet had only shrunk, making the case for higher tariffs. “In 2016, industry Arpu was ₹200-205, which in today’s money terms would be about ₹350-400. But today, telecom as a share of the wallet spend of any consumer has shrunk to about ₹150, which in today’s money, is 50-60% lower than what it would have been in 2016. While telecom services were important then, they are critical now, so there’s no reason why five years from now, we can’t be where we were in 2016,"" Takkar said. He added that the short-term goal for the carrier will be to improve Arpu to ₹200, and progress to ₹250 and then to ₹300, in stages, which will provide a reasonable return on capital employed, a key metric that investors look at while making investments. “I’m always willing to lead it (tariff increase). I have led it before and if I think it’s the right thing for the business, I would certainly be happy to lead another price increase,"" Takkar said. While Vodafone Idea’s Arpu has risen to ₹124 as of March 2022, it still lags Bharti Airtel which has the highest Arpu of ₹178 and market leader Reliance Jio which has Arpu of ₹168. The top executive said that the company’s plans to raise additional funds of about ₹20,000 crore, equally split between debt and equity, from external investors were close to fruition, and their completion could lead to the promoters putting in more equity. “They’ve put in ₹4,500 crore, which I think has been very helpful. It sets the ball rolling for other investors to come in, it sets the ball rolling for potentially even more promoter equity to come in,"" Takkar said. Aditya Birla Group and Vodafone Group PLC invested ₹4,500 crore into Vodafone Idea in FY22, leading to an increase in promoter holding in the Indian entity. The promoter equity is part of the ₹25,000 crore capital infusion plan laid out by the carrier in September 2020. “We are closer than ever than we would be to fundraising and I can tell you, there’s no hold-up; it’s a process. We are progressing,"" Takkar said. Asked whether the talks involved raising funds from Amazon or Amazon Web Services, he declined to comment. The carrier, sitting on the industry’s largest pile of debt of ₹1.98 trillion, has been trying to secure funding for nearly two years, with little success. Takkar said that while 90% of the debt was owed to the government, existing lenders were more comfortable with their exposures to Vodafone Idea after the government’s relief package. He added that banks were willing to lend more, which will drive its capex plans and improve network coverage of 4G sites. After the government’s olive branch to the industry, Vodafone Idea took the option to pay its adjusted gross revenue dues—the highest among the three telcos—after a moratorium of four years, in instalments, and also opted for converting the interest on these dues during the moratorium into equity to be owned by the government. Takkar said that government shareholding in the carrier should be completed soon with the latest clearance coming from the Securities Exchange Board of India (Sebi) exempting the government from an open offer after taking majority shareholding in the Aditya Birla Group-promoted company. He noted that the dramatic shift in the government’s view of the industry, as an essential service provider instead of a cash cow, has helped the industry immensely."
Updated: 31 May 2022,Telecom companies to hike tariffs again,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/private-telcos-to-hike-tariffs-again-fy23-revenues-to-jump-25-report-11654000063284.html,"India's top three private telecom providers - Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea - are likely raise tariffs again in the second half of this fiscal year, says a report. According to a report released on May 31, India's top three private telecom providers will raise tariffs again in the second half of this fiscal year, resulting in revenue increase of 20-25 percent for FY23.  In a report, the domestic rating agency Crisil's research wing stated that growth in average income per user is critical for the industry to invest in the network and spectrum, and that if it does not, it would result in poor service offerings. Following years of strong rivalry, the industry began raising pricing in December 2019 after the advent of Reliance Jio. ""...revenue of the top three players is expected to grow a robust 20-25 percent this fiscal,"" the note said, adding that the operating profit margin will expand by 1.80-2.20 percent during the fiscal. It added that following a modest 5 percent increase in ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) in FY22, the critical statistic is likely to rise by 15-20% in FY23 as the full impact of the previous fiscal's hikes plays out, as well as on the back of newer hikes due in the second half of this fiscal. Because players are likely to spend more on network and regulatory capex in FY23, it is possible that ARPU growth and tariff hikes would relieve some of the pressure on their books, according to the report. The overall number of subscribers fell in the previous fiscal year as 3.70 crore inactive users were weeded out, according to the study, but active subscribers increased. According to the report, the three biggest telecom companies had a 3 percent increase in active customers, with 2.90 crore new members added to the tally. Between August 2021 and February 2022, Reliance Jio's entire subscriber count dropped dramatically. However, the company's active subscriber share increased to 94 percent in March 2022, up from 78 percent in the first quarter of the previous fiscal year, according to the company, which also stated that Bharti Airtel added 1.10 crore active subscribers during the fiscal year, bringing its active user share to 99 percent. Vodafone Idea had a ""mixed bag"" of results in FY23, with the business losing three crore active users due to poor 4G expenditure and ""deterioration of services,"" according to the rating agency.

EBITDA stood strong at ₹7,597 Cr, up 30% YoY, flat QoQ, and in line with our estimate. The YoY growth was led by higher EBITDA from Aluminium India on the back of strong Aluminium prices. Flat EBITDA performance QoQ was led by the drop in Novelis' EBITDA mainly due to higher energy prices in Europe. Adjusted PAT stood strong at ₹3,851 Cr, up 100% YoY and 5% QoQ, but missed our estimate due to higher depreciation and interest expense.

High frequency indicators already point to some loss of momentum in the recovery that has been gaining traction from the second quarter of 2021-22. Furthermore, steadfast policy support put a floor underneath aggregate demand and economic activity. Thus, as per RBI, the experience of 2021-22 has yielded valuable lessons that will illuminate the path of the Indian economy in the year ahead. Headline inflation spiked on repetitive supply shocks during the year, though reversion to the target was also evident as shocks receded, RBI said on its Annual Report for 2021-22 released on Friday. The monetary policy remained accommodative and fostered congenial financial conditions for the recovery to take root, while being vigilant that inflation remains within the target going forward.

It can't be a situation where the operation is successful and the patient is dead,"" Das said.

Updated: 26 May 2022,Moody’s upgrades Bharti Airtel’s rating,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/moodys-upgrades-bharti-airtel-s-rating-11653587400243.html,"Moody’s Investors Service on Thursday upgraded Bharti Airtel’s rating from Ba1 to Baa3 and changed the outlook from positive to stable, on the back of improving operational metrics, lower leverage and better profitability. Moody’s has also upgraded senior unsecured debt rating on bonds issued by Bharti and senior unsecured notes issued by Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) B.V from Ba1 to Baa3. “The rating upgrade reflects continued strengthening of Bharti’s operational metrics as well as stabilization of its financial profile, including lower leverage levels and improving profitability,""said Annalisa Di Chiara, a senior vice president at Moody’s. “We expect improvements will be sustained given Bharti’s solid market position, rising profitability at its core Indian mobile business and prudent financial management."" According to Bharti Airtel, the stable outlook reflects its improving operating profile credit metrics, including its expectation of growing free cash flows and liquidity over the next 12-24 months, particularly for Indian operations. Moody’s expects its consolidated adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to remain stable or improve, despite investments in 5G spectrum. Cash flow savings from the moratorium will be redeployed to reduce debt permanently, it added. Bharti’s Baa3 rating considers its position as one of the largest telecom service operators globally with 491 million subscribers, its strong position in India’s high-growth mobile market, and large spectrum holdings. Bharti’s proven ability to access capital markets and the benefits of a strong and supportive shareholder base are reflected in the ratings, the ratings agency said. The telco reported over 25% rise in consolidated adjusted EBITDA to ₹58,100 crore in FY22 compared to the year-ago, which reflected the growing proportional share in 4G subscriber base and a further step-up in average revenue per user (ARPU) in the mobile services segment, which contributed around 53% of consolidated EBITDA. Its decision to increase tariff in December also helped drive ARPUs higher and supports Moody’s expectations of sustained profitability in the next 12-18 months. Moody’s expects 15-20% growth in the company’s consolidated adjusted EBITDA by the end of FY23 on the back of stable growth in both Indian and African markets. Bharti holds a 56% stake in its subsidiary, Airtel Africa plc, which contributed around 30% to consolidated EBITDA. “While some uncertainty remains related to spectrum purchases and funding for further 5G investments, Moody’s expects Bharti to maintain leverage measures that are consistent with an investment grade rating,"" it added. Airtel’s leverage, measured by adjusted debt to EBITDA, dropped to around 3 x as of 31 March from 3.8x in 2021. Moody’s said the company is well positioned to buy 5G airwaves with cash from operations. Besides, it has ₹15,800 crore from the ₹21,000 crore rights issue it raised in August."

At the same time, Moody's has withdrawn the company's Ba1 corporate family rating (CFR). It has also changed the outlook on the ratings to stable from positive. Bharti Airtel's Baa3 rating considers the company's position as one of the largest telecom service operators globally in terms of subscribers (491 million), its solid market position in India's (Baa3 stable) high-growth mobile market and its large spectrum holdings. Bharti's proven ability to access capital markets and the benefits of its strong and supportive shareholder base are also reflected in the ratings, said Moody's explaining the rationale behind the upgrade. Moody's expects a further 15%-20% increase in Bharti's consolidated adjusted EBITDA by the end of fiscal 2023, reflecting stable growth at its Indian operations and African operations, which are held through its 56%- owned subsidiary, Airtel Africa plc (Airtel Africa), and contribute around 30% of consolidated EBITDA. Moody's also expects investments in 5G spectrum, should an auction occur over the next few months, will not worsen the company's leverage profile. This is based on Moody's assumption that the company will largely fund its participation with cash and cash flow from operations and also has additional calls on its remaining balance under the rights issue. “The stable outlook reflects Bharti's improving operating profile credit metrics, including Moody's expectation of growing free cash flows and liquidity over the next 12-24 months, particularly at the core Indian operations,"" Moody's added. Though, as per the rating agency, an upgrade is unlikely over the near term given the recent upgrade.  "

Singtel will be able to generate close to ₹7,500 crore on sale of its 2% stake, as per market capitalisation. ""The discussion is going on between Singtel and Mr Mittal. Singtel is looking to sell 2-4 per cent stake in Bharti Airtel to Mr Mittal,"" a source told PTI. However, it is not disclosed whether the transaction will take place in Bharti Airtel or Bharti Telecom.  Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (Singtel) and the Mittal family are shareholders in Bharti Airtel's promoter company Bharti Telecom. Singtel's effective stake in Bharti Airtel is 31.7% whereas it holds a 49.44% stake in Mittal family-owned firm Bharti Telecom. Bharti Telecom holds a 35.85% in Bharti Airtel. In March this year, Singtel monetised partial stake in Airtel Africa as part of its capital recycling strategy. It raised net proceeds of approximately S$150 million from the placement which was oversubscribed. India's second-largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel posted more than twofold year-on-year jump in its consolidated net profit for the March quarter to ₹2,008 crore, buoyed by a lift in average revenue per user (ARPU) and an exceptional gain. Airtel's revenue from operations rose 22% year-on-year (YoY) to ₹31,500 crore during Q4 FY22."

Nifty 50 index ended 99 points lower at 16,025 levels whereas BSE Sensex shed 303 points and closed at 53,749 levels. Nifty Bank index was the sole gainer while IT, capital goods, oil & gas and realty were the large losers amongst sectors. Broad markets were very weak as reflected form the poor advance decline ratio (lowest since 24th February 2022) and large loses in mid-cap and small-cap indices. According to stock market experts, the daily time frame of Nifty indicates that index has made a double bottom around the 15,735 levels and rallied sharply last Friday. Nifty has however failed to convincingly cross the recent swing high of 16,400 and is showing tiredness and has corrected in the last three sessions. Day trading guide for stock market today Speaking on day trading strategy for Nifty today, Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities said, ""While we remain open to further pullback rallies in the very near term, we must remember that the intermediate trend remains down. The bears would gain more control once the recent intermediate low of 15,735 is broken."" Advising traders to remain cautious and avoid long positions, Ruchit Jain, Lead Research, 5paisa.com said, ""The Nifty mid-cap index was unable to surpass its moving average hurdle and has resumed its ‘Lower Top Lower Bottom’ structure. Thus, the downtrend has resumed post a consolidation phase in the mid-cap space and it could well spill over to the indices as well in the near term. Hence, traders are advised to stay cautious and avoid longs until the Nifty cross its '20 DEMA’ hurdle, which is now around 16,350."" Suggesting 'Sell on Rise' strategy for traders, Ruchit Jain said, ""One can keep trading with a ‘Sell on Rise’ strategy and use intraday pullbacks to lighten up longs as well.""

Updated: 26 May 2022,Network slicing may challenge net neutrality,https://www.livemint.com/industry/telecom/network-slicing-may-challenge-net-neutrality-11653506800339.html,"NEW DELHI :   The debut of 5G networks is expected to pose a challenge to India’s net neutrality rules as telcom operators set their eyes on so-called network slicing. Slicing effectively means giving preferential or differential treatment to a select set of customers in terms of cost or speed. However, the move would breach the government’s net neutrality rules that do not permit such experiences. Carriers may therefore seek regulatory intervention to carve out or exempt services for, say, business-to-business connections or those provided to enterprises to offer high-speed, lower-latency services, said industry experts. “Slicing and edge computing provide a differential experience in terms of technology and costing, and 5G has a different economic value attached to it versus 4G. So, both these elements put together call for a relook at the net neutrality rules or change in policy or regulation such that slicing can be permitted,"" said S.P. Kochhar, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which represents all telcos including Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. He said that the differentiated services were akin to providing business-to-business services, which are separate from business-to-consumer services offered by telecos, and therefore can be exempted from net neutrality laws. “Regulation should keep up with technology to avoid litigation,"" he noted. Telcos have yet to raise the issue with the government or the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), which had recommended the net neutrality rules in 2018, and were subsequently incorporated into the licence agreements of carriers. The rules prohibit telcos, internet service providers and others from blocking, slowing or giving preferential speeds or treatment to content on their networks. The rules also prohibit telcos or social media companies from offering zero-rated services or sponsored platforms, which can ride on the networks but are offered free to users, effectively stifling competition. A multi-stakeholder body would be set up to monitor net neutrality compliance and ascertain exemptions, while the government will set traffic management practices, which are yet to be put in place, the rules further stated. According to sector analysts, carriers are testing use cases requiring dedicated bandwidth or slice of the network."
Updated: 23 May 2022,"Jio, Airtel in position to buy pan-India spectrum, uncertainty on VIL bid",https://www.livemint.com/industry/telecom/reliance-jio-bharti-airtel-in-position-to-buy-pan-india-spectrum-uncertainty-on-vil-bid-11653320322944.html,"BofA Securities report released on Monday said that Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel are in a position to buy pan-India 5G spectrum, however, uncertainty remains around Vodafone Idea's bids for the radiowaves. It would be difficult for any telecom firm, which has not bid for 5G spectrum in a particular circle to roll out 5G on the existing 4G bands, because the existing networks are running at a capacity, and hence there is limited free spectrum which could be carved out, the report stated. It noted: ""Higher reserve price is likely to disincentive any new telcos to bid in the auction and only telcos with strong balance sheets like RIL, Bharti are in a position to buy pan India 5G spectrum. It remains unclear how VIL would fund its 5G bids."" The management at VIL has focused on top core circles and the firm is likely to selectively bid in their core 3G and 4G circles, BofA research analysts believed. The report said, ""Post 5G, we believe VIL would be further vulnerable if it doesn't have pan India 5G spectrum.""  The BofA report estimates that operators may be interested in 3.5 GHz in this auction as it is the primary band for 5G, while the premium 700 MHz may garner limited interest given its high pricing and as its propagation characteristics are similar to that of 800 and 900 MHz band. ""Interest on 28 GHz likely in the next auction even if the government decides to auction this time,"" the report stated. The Centre expects to hold the next round of spectrum auction by June-end or early July. The 5G services are expected to make their way in India by August-September. The Department of Telecom is likely to move the 5G spectrum auction proposal to the Union Cabinet for final approval this week. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has recommended a mega auction plan of over ₹7.5 lakh crore for over 1 lakh megahertz spectrum in case the government allocates it for a period of 30 years. In case of 20 years, the total value of the proposed spectrum auction will stand at around ₹5.07 lakh crore at the reserve price, according to back-of-the-envelop calculations. With large swathes of spectrum remaining unsold in the last two auctions, Trai has recommended selling airwaves in all existing bands of 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz and new slots of 600 MHz, 3300-3670 MHz and 24.25-28.5 GHz. BofA Securities also says that Jio will be aggressive in looking to deploy 5G, especially standalone 5G, which would force other telcom players also to front load capex investments. ""A key challenge could be on the device ecosystem front given the semiconductor supply-chain issues and relatively higher price points,"" the report said. BofA Securities said the Centre is expected to consider allocating or auctioning E and V bands for backhaul, which would help reduce the dependence on fibre backhaul connectivity, especially in tier 2 and 3 cities. ""The timing of this is not unknown but the government is keen to allocate the band as soon as it could,"" the report added."
Updated: 19 May 2022,"Airtel has good Q4; 5G, tariff hike in focus now",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/airtel-has-good-q4-5g-tariff-hike-in-focus-now-11652897995733.html,"Bharti Airtel Ltd fared well in the March quarter (Q4FY22). It added net 3 million subscribers sequentially to the Indian mobile customer base. In the earnings call, the company’s management indicated that SIM consolidation and moderation in 4G net addition did weigh on subscriber additions. The prices of smart phones have increased because of the chip shortage, softening the upgrade from 2G to 4G. Still, Airtel has outperformed its peers, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea, which saw a sequential dip in subscribers of 10.8 million and 3.4 million, respectively. Airtel’s mobile services India segment clocked a sequential revenue growth of 9.5% to ₹17,617 crore. In comparison, Jio and Vodafone Idea’s revenue grew at a relatively slower pace of 8% and 5.4%, respectively. Airtel’s healthy revenue performance can be attributed to the rise in average revenue per user (Arpu) led by healthy flow through of tariff hikes and customer additions. Airtel’s Arpu rose to ₹178 from ₹163 in Q3. In Q4, Jio and Vodafone Idea’s Arpu stood at 168 and 124, respectively.     "

It expects the next tariff hike which is pending this year to drive the company's APRU to ₹200 mark. Airtel has announced its financial performance for the quarter and year ending March 2022. During an investor call, Bharti Airtel India and South Asia MD and CEO Gopal Vittal said, ""My own sense is that we should start seeing some tariff increases during the course of this year. I do believe that the tariffs at that level are still very low. The first port of call is to get to ₹200 which will require at least one round of tariff increase,"" reported PTI. During Q4FY22, Airtel posted a consolidated net profit of ₹2,007.8 crore rising by a breath-taking 164.46% from ₹759.2 crore in the same quarter last year. Airtel surpassed analysts' estimates. Consolidated revenue from operations jumped by 22% to ₹31,500 crore in Q4FY22 compared to ₹25,747 crore in the corresponding period of last year. The growth was backed by strong and consistent performance delivery across the portfolio. Airtel's ARPU rose to ₹178 in Q4FY22 compared with ₹145 in Q4 of last year and ₹163 in the preceding quarter. Major telecom players have been increasing mobile calls and data prices for the last two years. As per the report, from November-December 2021 period, three private players Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea raised mobile plan prices ranging by 18-25%. As per Vittal, the company was able to gain 4G customers even as the shortage of electronic chips led to an increase in the prices of smartphones. The postpaid customer base crossed the 20 crore mark. Further, Vittal mentioned that the chip shortage led to a rise in the price of entry-level smartphones from ₹7,000 to about ₹10,000 which impeded mobile phone upgradation. According to Vittal, this is a temporary phenomenon and the reason is that people tend to get used to a new normal. He said, ""I think the initial shock is likely to wear off in the next few months. That said there are obviously headwinds in terms of inflation in commodity prices, energy prices, and so on. All of that obviously takes a toll on consumers, and wallets. Let's see how this plays out."" Talking about Airtel's vision for the next five years, Vittal said, the company's non-mobility business should become large by that period including B2B business and broadband business. He added, ""ARPUs on mobility should be close to ₹300. In fact, it should be around that level in the next five years."" In Q4FY22, Airtel's mobile customer base in India climbed by only 1.5% to 32.6 crore from 32.1 crore in the same quarter a year ago."

If you take a three to four year view, yes, 5G will go in most parts of urban India but if you take the immediate view of 22-23, I would imagine that this this must be this will be a moderate rollout,"" Airtel chief executive Gopal Vittal said in an analyst call on its fourth quarter earnings on Wednesday.  Vittal, who was reappointed in the role for another five years on Wednesday, said that the carrier was fully ready for rolling out 5G but its strategy would depend upon the final reserve prices that will be decided by the government.  “We are fully ready for 5G, our core network, our radio network, and even our transport network is fully future proofed,"" he said.  “We will not comment on our strategy and approach since it is dependent on the final user price finalized by the company,"" he added.  Vittal said that the base levels recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) were disappointing. The telecom industry has been asking for a 90-95% reduction in the 2018 reserve price of ₹49,200 crore for pan-India 5G airwaves, however, Trai has recommended a near 36% reduction from these levels.  “The industry had hoped for a massive reduction in prices. While there has been a reduction, it has not been adequate and is in that sense disappointing,"" he said.  The Airtel chief executive further noted that the semiconductor shortage and rising chipset prices had led to rise in entry level smartphone prices, and hence softening of upgradation to 4G from 2G, amid headwinds of rising commodity and energy prices. However, this was likely to pass as consumers were likely to settle for escalated prices.  “I believe this is a temporary phenomenon and the reason is that people tend to get used to a new normal, and I think the initial shock is likely to wear off in the next few months. That said there are obviously headwinds in terms of inflation on commodity prices and energy prices that obviously take a toll on consumers, wallets. Let’s see how this plays out,"" he said.  The carrier will also undertake another round of tariff increase to get to the ARPU level of ₹200 per user per month, despite inflation concerns, as it feels that the present tariff levels were extremely low.  “We should start seeing some tariff increases during the course of this year. Tariffs at the level they are, are still very, very low and I think we’ve been consistent in in saying that the first port of call is to be to get to 200 rupees, which would require at least one round of tariff increase,"" he said.  Vittal said that tariff increase would be easily absorbed by majoroty of the customer base since the carrier had not seen SIM consolidation – as an effect of tariff increase – in the 550 million smartphone customer base, as much as it did in the featurephone segment where ARPUs were about ₹100 per month.  Vittal said in response to a question on tariff outlook that the carrier was looking to reach the ₹300 ARPU mark over the next five years. India’s second-largest telecom operator’s average revenue per user—a key measure of profitability—was ₹178 for the quarter, the highest among its rivals. It was 22.7% more than ₹145 in the same quarter last financial year, and 9.2% more than ₹163 in the December quarter.  Airtel Ltd posted a net profit of ₹2,008 crore for the quarter ended March, a massive 164% growth over the same quarter last year, as the full flow of tariff increase took effect and its 4G customers crossed the 200-million mark. Profit jumped 142% from ₹829 crore in the December quarter.  The Sunil Mittal-promoted carrier recorded a 22.3% growth on-year in consolidated revenue to ₹31,500 crore for the quarter, while revenue from its India business rose 22.7% to ₹22,500 crore. Vittal said that that the carrier had raised $18 billion of funding to strengthen our balance sheet over the last few years, improving its leverage from 2.95 to 2.51. For FY23, the operating free cash flow will be ‘more than adequate to cover’ all of its capex needs and with improved tariffs, the operating leverage will release more cash. Airtel Group’s chief financial officer Harjeet Kohli said that the carrier is expected to see benefit of ₹1600-1700 crore to its P&L statement on an annualised basis as an impact of cash flows from the business, pre-payment of ₹24,000 crore of government debt, bank guarantees being returned by the government and cheaper rate refinance over the past months.  Airtel’s free cash flow was at over ₹10,000 crore on a consolidated basis for the March quarter, rising from ₹8,803 crore in December. For the full year, free cash flow stood at ₹32,448 crore, up from ₹21,970 crore.  Vittal further added that Airtel had agreed on a broad framework for renewing its tower contract, and that it will be inked by the end of the quarter."

Updated: 18 May 2022,Airtel outperforms peers in Q4; debt reduction underwhelms ,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/airtel-outperforms-peers-in-q4-debt-reduction-underwhelms-11652855611381.html,"Bharti Airtel Ltd’s March quarter (Q4FY22) results were good on many counts. For one, sequential net additions in mobile subscriber base stood at 3 million. This compares to a fall in Reliance Jio’s net subscribers of 10.8 million and Vodafone Idea’s decline of 3.4 million. However, Airtel’s churn remained elevated at 2.8%. Airtel’s average revenue per user (Arpu) rose to ₹178 from ₹163 in Q3. For perspective: Q4 Arpu of Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea stood at ₹168 and ₹124, respectively. As a result, Airtel’s mobile services India segment reported 9.5% quarter-on-quarter increase in revenue to ₹17,617 crore. In comparison, Jio and Vodafone’s sequential revenue growth stood at 8% and 5%, respectively. Airtel’s healthy revenue performance can be attributed to the rise in Arpu led by healthy flow through of tariff revision and strong 4G customer additions. On the other hand, revenues from Africa in Q4 rose 1% sequentially, and were below expectations. India’s non mobile segments, homes and airtel business, also saw a strong growth in revenue by 10% and 2%, respectively. The homes segment added 323,000 customers in the March quarter driven by an increase in local cable operator tie-ups. Overall, Bharti Airtel’s consolidated revenue rose 5.5% sequentially to ₹31,500 crore. Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin expanded 170 basis points sequentially to 50.9%. One basis point is 0.01%.  Growth in Ebitda along with the 2% decline in capital expenditure in Q4 led to a significant increase in free cash flow (FCF). According to Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India), consolidated operating FCF stood at ₹10,000 crore, up about 14% quarter-on-quarter. Nonetheless, debt reduction remains underwhelming. “Airtel’s net debt (excluding lease liability) of ₹1,23,500 crore saw limited reduction due to Indus Towers’ stake acquisition and AGR (adjusted gross revenue) interest capitalisation,"" said analysts from Motilal Oswal Financial Services. As such, the management’s commentary on further tariff hikes and 5G spectrum auction remains key. “With improved free cashflow generation, cashflow relief from moratorium on government dues and ongoing rights issue, we think Bharti remains well-placed to compete with R-Jio on 5G rollouts,"" said Aditya Bansal, analyst at Nomura in a report on 18 May."
