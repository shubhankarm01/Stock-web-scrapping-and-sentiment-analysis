Updated: 30 Jun 2022,The bright side of Asian Paints’ recovery,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/asian-paints-beats-the-inflation-blues-with-robust-volume-growth-11656525265578.html,"The past few quarters have been lacklustre for the paint industry. Concerns over high raw material inflation, a slowdown in demand, and rising competition has taken the sheen away from paint stocks. Even the market leader in the decorative paints segment, Asian Paints Ltd, has not been spared. The stock slid to a 52-week low of ₹2,560 on 17 June on NSE and is now about 5% above that level. However, so far this calendar year, the stock has corrected by 20%. There are some bright spots that can soothe the frayed nerves of investors. An analysis by Antique Stock Broking suggests that during inflationary periods (FY11-12 and FY18-19), Asian Paints has absorbed part of the inflation to protect its volume growth and market share. “However, in subsequent years, the company has regained its margins by calibrated price hikes and operating scale,"" said Antique’s analysts in a report on 29 June.

Updated: 24 Jun 2022,Top picks: Sharekhan is bullish on these 6 cement stocks for robust gain ahead,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/top-picks-sharekhan-is-bullish-on-these-6-cement-stocks-for-robust-gain-ahead-11656089157281.html,"The leading brokerage firm Sharekhan has placed a buy call rating on the shares of Shree Cement for a target price (TP) of ₹26000, Ultratech Cement (TP: ₹7100), Grasim Industries (TP: ₹1740), The Ramco Cement (TP: ₹850), JK Lakshmi Cement (TP: ₹600), and Dalmia Bharat (TP: 1850). These recommendations were made because the brokerage forecasts that, in accordance with the plans disclosed by major cement players, the cement sector would add more than 90 mtpa in capacity between FY2023 and FY2025. The brokerage has said in a note that “Cement industry is expected to add over 90 mtpa in capacities over FY2023- FY2025 as per plans announced by major players. This implies a 5% CAGR in installed capacity, while cement demand is estimated to post a 6-7% CAGR over FY2023-FY2025. With the rise in supply almost equivalent to demand growth, industry capacity utilizations levels would stay almost flat at 67-68% over FY2023- FY2025. Pan-India cement prices have risen each year during FY2015-FY2022 barring a couple of years, while in Q1FY2023, they are up 8% as compared to FY2022 level. Going by historical anecdotes, we believe cement prices to remain on an uptrend despite capacity additions over the next three years. On the cost front, International petcoke prices have corrected by 17% m-o-m and 20% from March 2022 levels in June 2022."" According to Sharekhan “The diesel prices across Metros declined by 5% m-o-m while they were up 3% y-o-y in June 2022. We expect the easing of petcoke/ coal prices during Q1FY2023 and ahead to reflect in operational performance for the industry from H2FY2023 as it exhausts high-cost fuel inventory fully during H1FY2023. We estimate our cement coverage universe to report 11% CAGR in sales volume over FY2022-FY2024 as against industry growth estimated at 6-7% per annum. Higher-than-industry growth is expected to be lead by market share gains by larger companies aided by rise in capacities."" The brokerage has claimed that “We estimate weighted average EBITDA/tonne for our coverage universe to grow at 4% CAGR during FY2022- FY2024 although the same may remain lower than peaks seen in FY2021. The improvement in EBITDA/tone is based on our assumptions of capacity utilizations remaining almost flat due to high capacity additions, part retention of growth in cement prices and easing of energy and freight costs."" By staying positive on the cement sector, Sharekhan has said “Our cement coverage universe has seen 30%-45% correction in stock prices over trailing five months led by Russia-Ukraine crisis, rise in energy costs and large capacity plans announced by leading cement players. The same has led to one year forward EV/EBITDA valuation multiples of almost all cement companies sinking below their historical averages. Notwithstanding, soft earnings performance for the cement pack in H1FY23, the recent correction offers good entry points for long term investors as sustainable infrastructure push over next 3-5 years coupled with easing out of input cost pressure in H2FY23E would drive stock performance over next 12-15 months. We remain construction and stay Positive on the sector. Our preferred picks are UltraTech, Shree Cement, Dalmia Bharat and JK Lakshmi Cement."" Weakness in demand, a decline in cement prices and a rise in key input costs like energy and freight costs are key risks to the industry, said Sharekhan, which investors should take note of.

The company will incur capital expenditure of ₹10,000 crore by FY25, which is twice the initial investment announced in 2021. Clearly, the competitive intensity in the Indian paints industry is heating up. In reaction, shares of Asian Paints Ltd and Berger Paints India Ltd fell by 7-8% on NSE on Wednesday. Grasim has also accelerated the execution of its paints capacity of 1,332 million litres per annum (mlpa) with the commissioning of plants to start by Q4FY24. This compares with around 1,750 mlpa capacity for Asian Paints but is much higher than that of Berger and Kansai Nerolac India Ltd.

The 360-degree campaign, the company said, will have a television commercial that will represent how a saree is breaking stereotypes with its fluid nature.  Conceptualised in line with the theme ‘Free To Be’, the ﻿campaign, it said, will showcase the brand’s intent to revolutionise the way sarees are perceived.  The range has been created by designers Abir and Nanki along with the internal design team at Liva. Rajnikant Sabnavis, chief marketing officer of Grasim Industries (pulp and fibre), “The brand’s intention is clear that it is here to stay and the association with Deepika Padukone as the face of the brand will only up the ante and take the brand to the next level. She is a great fit for the brand. The campaign idea is in sync with the brand spirit and brings alive the ethos effectively. We are very happy to see the response to the campaign and the aspiration it inculcates among the audience.""  According to research website Statista, in 2020, the Indian advertising industry was valued at over $564 billion and it was projected to reach up to $700 billion by this year.  The industry had grown at a rate of 11.59% in the given time frame, and was poised for further growth on the back of rapid digitalisation in the upcoming years. "
Updated: 25 May 2022,"As Grasim doubles investment in paints, risks rise for incumbents",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/as-grasim-doubles-investment-in-paints-risks-rise-for-incumbents-11653455724020.html,"Grasim Industries Ltd. now plans to invest ₹10,000 crore in the paints industry by FY25. Note that this is double of its ₹5,000 crore investment plan to set up its paints business, which was announced last year. Clearly, the competitive intensity in the once oligopolistic Indian paints sector is heating up, raising concerns of buisness disruption for incumbents Asian Paints Ltd. and Berger Paints India Ltd. Reacting to this development, shares of both these companies declined around 3% each on the National Stock Exchange in opening deals on Wednesday. Asian Paints is the market leader in the decorative paints segment, followed by Berger. Grasim has also accelerated the execution of its paint's capacity of 1,332 million litres per annum with the commissioning of plants to start by Q4FY24. It aims to become the number two decorative paints company over a period of time. Analysts note that this compares with 1,700 mlpa for Asian Pants and is much higher than Berger and Kansai Nerolac India Ltd. To be sure, the paints industry has high entry barriers and history shows that not many new comers have tasted huge success here. Scalability is among the key challenges that new companies in this sector have often faced, said analysts. For instance, international paint companies Nippo and Jotun. Even so, Grasim pumping in more funds, does come as a sentiment dampener for existing companies. ""We believe the threat from new competitors is higher than in the past, as the new entrants are domestic players that possess an understanding of the Indian commodity industry and have strong balance sheets and the drive to grow to be among the top players,"" analysts at Morgan Stanley India Company Pvt. Ltd said in a report on 24 May. Concurring, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd said, Grasim may go for an aggressive strategy (pricing or otherwise) and disturb the market structure which may have a greater impact on smaller players, but Asian Paints may also be at risk. ""This is reminiscent of Jio's foray into the telecom industry, with significant capacity additions, which ultimately resulted in lower industry tariffs,"" said the Jefferies report dated 24 May. Recall that in the telecom sector, quite a few firms folded up after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. entered the market in 2016 with cut-throat pricing and huge investments. Meanwhile, the paints industry has been grappling with input cost inflation pressures weighing on their gross margins. Paint makers have taken several rounds of price hikes in FY22 and have guided for more to offset this impact."

Market dynamics of the decorative paints segment have changed and the new capacity building initiative is backed by strong growth and outlook, the Aditya Birla group company said. Grasim is expanding production capacity to 1,332 million litre per annum (mlpa) and will commission plants by Q4 FY24. “The business is focused on timely execution of capacities.

Grasim saw successful commissioning of projects in core business verticals such as viscose staple fibre (VSF) and caustic soda in FY22, which helped drive Q4 performance.

Its recently commissioned 600-TPD brownfield plant at Vilayat contributed 32,000 tonnes to sales volume and operated at 83% capacity, the company said. Growing volumes helped in the 13% sequential and 46% year-on-year growth in revenues for the VSF business during Q4, despite VSF prices softening marginally. Covid-led restrictions in China and the Russia-Ukraine war led to marginally muted demand for textiles. VSF prices averaged lower at ¥12,903 in Q4 compared to ¥13,637 in Q3, following the rise in covid infections in China. In its chemical business, the company witnessed a demand revival despite higher domestic caustic soda prices, which were in line with global prices. Its chloralkali processing business reported the highest ever quarterly Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The company’s standalone revenue growth for the chemicals business was up 45% from the year-ago."

Of the 10 best performing Nifty stocks, during the year, three of them were part of the salt-to-software conglomerate, data showed. Surging 228%, Tata Motors was the best Nifty performer during Samvat 2077. Tata Steel with gains of 167% and Titan rising 91% were the other two Tata group Nifty stocks which have given strong returns. Rest of the top 10 best performing Nifty stocks were Bajaj Finserv, State Bank of India, Hindalco Industries, ONGC, Grasim Industries, JSW Steel, and Adani Ports which rose 92-139% during the period. Other Tata group Nifty stocks such as Tata Consumer rose 61%, while jewel of the pack Tata Consultancy Services jumped 30%. Barring Dr Reddy’s Labs and Hero MotoCorp, which fell 3-14%, all other Nifty stocks ended Samvat 2077 with gains. Among other Nifty stocks, Wipro rose 89%, Tech Mahindra was up 77%, Reliance Industries climbed 25% and Hindustan Unilever Ltd jumped 10%. ""There are clearly bright lights shining around us when we look at various economic indicators. It does seem that the economy is showing a turnaround, which is looking quite encouraging presently. Will this be sustained or not is a moot question, but for certain, things are looking up,"" said Care Ratings. Overall, it believes that the economy is on the right path and will chug along till March. A third wave looks less likely, and the vaccination drive is progressing well and hence it is reasonable to expect that the impact if at all it comes will be better borne by business.  ""We believe the pent-up demand would get diluted in manufacturing while it will elongate for services progressively. Job creation is the clue in the medium term if consumption is to be kept ticking. We must remember that inflation is a dampener and while statistically it is less than 5%, high fuel cost, prices of services and manufactured goods will hit consumption once the pent-up fury recedes,"" it said. Despite covid led lockdowns and uncertainties which had deterred economic growth, Samvat 2077 ended with best gains in 13 years. Riding on abundant liquidity, investors made nearly 40% profit in equities this year - best returns compared to other asset classes. Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty gained 39-40% in Samvat 2077. Last year, when markets had bounced from a major crash in March, both Sensex and Nifty gained 10-11%. Equity markets had a historical journey in Samvat 2077, touching new life- time highs with the Nifty surpassing the 18000-mark while the Sensex crossing 60,000 for the first time. Analysts said the government’s fiscal stimulus and a soft monetary policy stance of global central bankers were key drivers of equities in Samvat 2077. Post the second wave of covid, signs of improvement in high-frequency key economic indicators such as GST collection, railway freight, power consumption, import-export data, e-way bills among others amid vaccination boosted investor sentiment. Overall, most sectors delivered positive returns, with metals ( up 128%), realty (up 113%) and PSU banks (up 93%) as top gainers. Sectors such as pharma (up 23%), FMCG (up 29%) and private banks (up 30%) were underperformers as defensives took a breather. In comparison, mid- and small-caps did exceedingly well in Samvat 2077. The BSE MidCap index surged 61% while the BSE SmallCap jumped 79% during the year.  "

The demand by the IT department was related to the sale of shares in Aditya Birla Capital, a group firm. ""The imposed capital gain tax on the value of shares is without considering that the shares were issued to the shareholders in pursuant to scheme of arrangement and no consideration was received by the company, which could be subjected to tax,"" Grasim said in a filing today. “The company would take appropriate action against the said order which it believes is against the spirit of tax laws,"" it added. Grasim, part of a group under Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla, noted that India had sought dividend distribution tax related to the same deal in 2019, which was suspended by the courts until the tribunal makes a final decision. “There seems to be no justification for seeking capital gain tax, as there was no sale involved,"" said Ketan Dalal, founder at Katalyst Advisors, a boutique structuring and advisory firm. Grasim, a flagship company of the global conglomerate Aditya Birla Group, is a leading chemicals player in India and has a market-cap over ₹1 lakh crore. It is also the largest cement producer and has ventured into diversified financial services. The company's consolidated revenue during the first quarter of FY22 was up 53% year-on-year at ₹19,919 crore. Meanwhile, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 86% year-on-year to ₹4,736 crore, while the net profit came in at ₹1,667 crore.

Updated: 27 Sep 2021,Paint manufacturers may face disruption from chip shortage,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/paint-manufacturers-may-face-disruption-from-chip-shortage-11632765366605.html,"The chip shortage has affected industries ranging from automobiles to consumer electronics. Now, the supply crunch has claimed an unlikely victim: the Indian paint industry. The chip shortage, analysts cautioned, could impact the supply of tinting machines and the expansion plans of paint companies. These machines help shops create different shades of paints within the store, in line with the requirement of customers. Dealers who use tinting machines do not have to hold large amounts of shades in stock. As such, if the chip shortage becomes long-drawn, it could impact paint companies in terms of expansion through new dealerships. “We expect delays in (the supply of) tinting machines to remain for a few quarters for most paint companies. We expect less impact on top two companies, Asian Paints Ltd and Berger Paints Ltd, as they already have a high tinting machine penetration compared to smaller peers,"" analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a report on 22 September. The broker sees a higher impact on Indigo Paints Ltd, which had the highest rate of tinting machine addition over the past few years, given its smaller base and aggressive plans. On average, the annual rate of tinting machine addition for Indigo Paints since FY18 is around 51%, compared with 15-20% of Asian Paints and Berger Paints, the Edelweiss report said. New entrants in the paint industry will also have to face this challenge upfront. “Apart from the existing paint makers, it (the chip shortage) could also delay expansion plans of new entrants such as Grasim Industries Ltd, who are making a foray into this sector,"" said an analyst with a domestic brokerage house requesting anonymity. “That said, a bigger trigger for the sector and stock prices remains the movement in input costs and quantum of price hikes,"" the analyst said. Investors would reckon that the recent rise in prices of titanium dioxide and other crude-based monomers could lead to margin erosion if not adequately passed on. Meanwhile, shares of paint companies have seen a steep rally in the past year on demand improvement in the key decorative paint segment. However, despite the demand revival, the expensive valuations of paint stocks are hardly justified, analysts said."

Banking stocks: India's decision to ban Mastercard Inc for non-compliance with data storage rules has unsettled the country's financial sector as it will disrupt banks' card offerings and hit revenues, payments and banking industry executives told Reuters. ITC: The company, that sells popular packaged consumer brands, such as Aashirvaad flour, Bingo! chips, YiPPee! noodles, Sunfeast biscuits and Savlon, saw its sales double via e-commerce in FY21 in its fast-moving consumer goods business, excluding cigarettes.

The company’s authorized share capital is ₹10 lakh, divided into 1 lakh equity shares of ₹10 each. CTIL and Grasim have initially agreed to subscribe to 5000 equity shares each at a face value of ₹10 per share. MFI stocks: India Ratings and Research on Thursday revised upwards its credit cost estimate for the microfinance institution (MFI) sector to 5-10% in the current financial year as compared to an earlier expectation of 3-6%. The agency, however, said most of its large-rated MFIs would be able to absorb higher credit costs through their income statement, with minimal impact on equity. Power stocks: Power consumption grew nearly 17% in the first fortnight of July to 59.36 billion units (BU) and returned to pre-pandemic level mainly due to easing of lockdown curbs and delayed monsoon, according to power ministry data. Power consumption during July 1-14 last year was 50.79 BU. RIL: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has added 499 units and affiliates in just over four years as the refiner and chemicals maker expanded into new businesses, including telecom and renewable energy.

Updated: 25 May 2021,Better performance of VSF boosts Grasim Industries’ Q4 results,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/better-performance-of-vsf-boosts-grasim-industries-q4-results-11621923326089.html,"MUMBAI: Grasim Industries Ltd’s results for the March quarter were helped by a decent recovery in its VSF (viscose staple fibre) segment. Last quarter, Grasim’s standalone revenues rose 19% sequentially to Rs4,394 crore. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margin expanded 102 basis points on quarter to 18.5%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The VSF segment reported best ever Ebitda of Rs548 crore in Q4FY21, said Grasim in its investor presentation. Including viscose filament yarn, overall viscose business Ebitda stood at Rs625 crore. Strong viscose business performance was led by robust underlying domestic demand, improved realisations and better product mix. “Factoring better VSF profitability, we raise our FY22-23E Ebitda 4-6%,"" said analysts from ICICI Securities Ltd in a report on 25 May. “Continuing with our thrust on cost saving, total savings of about Rs800 crore was achieved by VSF business during FY21,"" said Grasim. In the chemicals business, while revenues increased 15% quarter-on-quarter, Ebitda growth was relatively slower at 4.5% on account of higher costs. Meanwhile, it is encouraging that the company has managed to reduce its debt significantly. At the end of financial year 2021, standalone net debt dropped to Rs914 crore from Rs2,999 crore last year. During the period, consolidated net debt dropped to Rs8,831 crore from Rs20,882 crore, respectively. To be sure, the outperformance of shares of Grasim Industries suggests investors are capturing a good portion of the optimism into the stock price. So far this calendar year, the Grasim stock has appreciated 47% compared to around 10% gain in the Nifty 100 index. Analysts from Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, in a report on 25 May, said, “Given Grasim's conglomerate business structure, we value it on a SoTP (sum-of-the-parts) basis."" The broker added, “Our target price values: a) the standalone business (Viscose, Chemicals, etc.) at 6 times FY22E EV/Ebitda, b) UltraTech Cement at a 50% holding company discount to our TP, and c) other listed investments (Aditya Birla Capital, Vodafone Idea, Hindalco Industries, and Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail) at a 50% holding company discount to its market price."" Accordingly, Motilal Oswal arrives at a fair value of Rs1,475 per share for Grasim Industries. On Monday, the stock closed at Rs1,370.15 on the National Stock Exchange. It traded marginally lower on Tuesday in early deals."

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was barely changed in slow trade. Japan's Nikkei added 0.1% and South Korea was flat. After surveys of the global service sectors out on Friday showed spectacular growth, all eyes will be on US personal consumption and inflation figures this week.

Updated: 26 Mar 2021,Grasim is no Jio; investors in paint stocks downplay competition threat,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/grasim-is-no-jio-investors-in-paint-stocks-downplay-competition-threat-11616695236149.html,"Shares of top paint companies, Asian Paints Ltd and Berger Paints Ltd, have declined by 7% and 5%, respectively, since Grasim Industries Ltd announced its plan to foray into the sector in January. The pricey valuations of the two firms have more or less remained intact. “It is unlikely for a new company to disrupt the paint industry like Reliance Jio did in the telecom industry,"" said Mahesh Anand, president, Indian Paints Association. “The purchase pattern is different and is influenced by painters and contractors, and the quality and brand also play an important role,"" he said while speaking at a conference.  India’s per capita consumption of paints of ₹4 a kg per person is nearly half of the ₹7-8 a kg per person consumption in developed countries. “This leaves a huge opportunity for new companies to come and get a share of the pie,"" he added. “While the threat of market share loss is there for incumbent paint companies with a new player making an entry, irrational competition or disruption appears unlikely. As seen historically, scalability has been a challenge for new entrants in the sector, though we recognize that Grasim may potentially become a large player in due course,"" said Manoj Menon, head of research and consumer analyst, ICICI Securities Ltd. Meanwhile, shares of Kansai Nerolac Ltd and Akzo Nobel India Ltd have seen double-digit decline of 12-15% each since 22 January. Investors would reckon that the Aditya Birla group company, Grasim Industries, will invest ₹5,000 crore in this venture. It aims to become the second largest decorative paint maker. “In the paints sector, entry of Grasim could mean higher risk for number two and three players—Berger and Kansai— than market leader Asian Paints,"" Menon added Apart from rising competition from a new player with deep pockets, there are other near-term headwinds facing the sector. The ongoing increase in prices of crude-derivatives and monomers could translate into gross margin compression in the coming quarters. Dealer channel checks by brokerages show that paint companies are yet to announce price hikes. It should be noted that the last price hike was taken in 2018. But as pointed earlier, investors continued to brush aside the concerns, and valuations of paint stocks remain high relative to the rest of the market. Going by the consensus earnings one-year forward estimates, Berger is the most expensive paint stock trading at a one-year PE of 76 times. Peers Asian Paints and Kansai are trading at PE multiples of 61 times and 45 times, respectively."

As the vaccines roll out, and governments and central banks provide stimulus, India will be among economies to rise above pre-pandemic levels, the billionaire said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Wednesday. His Aditya Birla Group has already unveiled plans to plow in about $2.4 billion across businesses in the past few weeks, months after putting on hold some of its expansion programs on account of the Covid-related lockdowns. Also Read | Battered infra dream awaits a new deal “Economists were throwing many letters at us -- V, W, X -- all sorts of things to describe the possible economic recovery. For us, its pretty much been a V,"" said Birla, the chairman of the group. “It’s been a very sharp recovery, a very huge surprise for all of us."" Birla’s expectations for a rebound echo those of India’s central bank, as some of the nation’s key indicators, including manufacturing, demand for loans and consumer purchases, showed signs of strengthening. The $2.9 trillion economy is set to shrink 7.7% in the year through March, its first full-year contraction in more than four decades, according to government estimates. The International Monetary Fund forecast an almost 12% gain in gross domestic product for Asia’s third-largest economy in 2021, albeit on a low base owing to the pandemic. Barring a second wave, the “worst is behind us"" with India kicking off a vaccination drive against Covid-19, the Reserve Bank of India said in its January bulletin. Grasim Industries Ltd., Birla’s flagship firm, said last week that it was entering the paints business and plans to invest Rs50 billion ($685 million) over three years. UltraTech Cement Ltd. said in December that it will spend Rs54.77 billion to increase capacity by 12.8 million tons annually while the group’s metals unit, Hindalco Industries Ltd. will spend Rs70 billion to double its aluminum downstream capacity over the next few years. Just in June last year, Hindalco said it was slowing down its expansion plans, while Novelis Inc., Hindalco’s U.S.-based aluminum unit, also delayed the ramp up of new finishing facilities in Guthrie, U.S. and Changzhou, China, until the second half of the fiscal year to align with demand. ‘Fizz Is Back’ The group, with roots dating back to 1857, has seen strong growth in its financial services, fashion retail, cement and metals businesses, according to Birla. “We are looking to grow very large in these companies,"" he said, adding that he was open to growing them organically or through acquisitions. “For Aditya Birla Group, the fizz is back."" The traction in other businesses is helping offset challenges in reviving Vodafone Idea Ltd. -- an indebted wireless carrier Birla jointly owns with U.K.’s Vodafone Group Plc. The local operator has reported nine straight quarters of losses amid intense price competition and faces $8 billion in government dues and has been losing subscribers to rivals. The Aditya Birla Group employs more than 120,000 employees across 36 countries and earns over 50% of its revenues from overseas, according to its website. “The recovery will be a little patchy,"" Birla said. China could race ahead to surpass European Union this year, while the U.S., Japan and some countries in Europe are unlikely to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels this year, he said."

Stocks of paint companies such as Asian Paints Ltd and Berger Paints India Ltd are among the most expensive on the Street, with the companies’ one-year forward price-earnings ratio at 62 times and 77 times, respectively. Some of that is already rubbing off on Grasim’s valuations. Conversely, the stocks of paint firms fell between 3% and 6%, on worries about increased competition. Grasim has said it will invest a massive ₹5,000 crore in the next three years and is eyeing the second position in the sector in terms of market share. The company plans to enter the decorative paints business, which is a ₹40,000 crore industry in India, the management told analysts. The industry has posted an 11% compound annual growth rate from FY14-19, it said, and expects an internal rate of return of more than 20%.  Earlier the JSW group had forayed into the paints sector, giving the impression that the sector is getting crowded and that return ratios will be on the decline. However, profit margins and returns are likely to be better compared to Grasim’s current mainstay business, fertilizers. “Paints companies reported Ebitda margins of 14-22% and RoCE of 18-33% in FY20, compared with 7-11% margins in the fertilizer business during FY18-20,"" analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd said in a report on 25 January. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Capturing market share in a space with large, well-entrenched firms, will be easier said than done. A key entry barrier here is distribution. In Grasim’s case, it may have an advantage, as the distribution network of its subsidiary would come in handy. UltraTech Cement Ltd sells putty under the ‘Birla White’ brand, which has a network of 54,000 dealers. Of these around 70% are said to have an overlap with paints and this can give it the second-largest distributor network in the paint industry. The big worry, of course, is the price competition that arises as a result of Grasim’s entry. Citing examples of consumer giants Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd and Hindustan Unilever Ltd, analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd point out that historically, consumer valuation has reacted adversely whenever there is excessive price-led competition. Paint companies have recently made forays into adjacent products such as white cement and putty, where traditional firms such as Grasim and its group arms already have a footprint. This almost gives the impression that Grasim’s move is in retaliation. So, investors should brace for a scenario of irrational price competition in paints as well as adjacent products. To that extent, the weakness in paint stocks is understandable. However, at the same time, it seems foolhardy to assume that Grasim will have sufficient gains to justify its large investment plans. Investors are perhaps ignoring this risk as they think they can afford to do so given Grasim’s relatively low valuation of around 11 times earnings."

Grasim’s strong balance sheet will facilitate this entry, which will add size, scale, and diversity to its existing portfolio of established standalone businesses,"" Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman, Aditya Birla Group, said. “The company endeavours to invest in businesses that have the potential to be a leader in their addressable markets, have the ability to achieve scale, and generate consistent and attractive returns in the long term. The paints industry presents a high-growth option for Grasim,"" he said. The paints sector registered a compound annual growth rate of around 11% in revenue during FY14-FY19, facilitating value migration from unorganized to organized markets. The outlook remains robust and provides space for a quality new player. Grasim said it will offer a wide choice to Indian consumers as it plans to introduce the latest range of products in line with global mega-trends. The $10-billion business is diversified across viscose staple fibre, linen, and insulators."

Banks and financial stocks: Banks and non-banks will restructure up to ₹10 trillion in debt or 8% of outstanding loans under the one-time debt recast scheme announced by the Reserve Bank of India, rating agency Icra said on Wednesday. Also, the Supreme Court is set to resume hearing in the loan moratorium case today. Vodafone Idea: Minority shareholders of Grasim Industries, who own 60% stake in the company, are unlikely to agree for further investment in Vodafone Idea, Business Standard reported citing bankers.

Updated: 16 Jun 2020,"After subdued Q4, near-term growth elusive for Grasim Industries",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/after-subdued-q4-near-term-growth-elusive-for-grasim-industries-11592288066352.html,"MUMBAI: Shares of Grasim Industries Ltd are about 27% lower than its highs seen in January. Unfortunately for investors, March quarter results announced on Saturday bring little respite. The company’s standalone Ebitda fell as much as 56% for the March quarter on a year-on-year basis to ₹394 crore. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation; a key measure of profitability. Profits were impacted on account of loss of sales due to the covid-19 lockdown. Plus, prices were weaker in the viscose stable fibre (VSF) and caustic soda segments. Even so, Grasim’s Ebitda is above some analysts’ expectations helped by lower costs in the VSF business. For the March quarter, overall revenues dropped 19% over the same period last year. But, muted Ebitda performance together with high depreciation and finance costs resulted in a whopping 77% drop in pre-tax earnings. After the March quarter, near-term demand recovery would be slow. The company has understandably toned down expectations for the June quarter. The lockdown-led demand slowdown would substantially impact the operational and financial performance for current quarter, pointed out Grasim in its March quarter earnings presentation. And that’s not all. “Outlook for both the key business segments, VSF and chemical, looks challenging in the near-term,"" wrote analysts from Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd in a report on 14 June. One reason for this is due to covid-19’s adverse impact on textile demand. “Higher VSF inventory in China (125 days at March-end) may keep the prices volatile in the near-term,"" point out Emkay analysts. Additionally, in the chemicals segment, increase in domestic capacities is expected to weigh on prices until demand recovery is seen. Needless to say, these factors would keep meaningful appreciation in the stock price at bay for a while. The risk of investment in group companies such as Vodafone Idea Ltd is also a key overhang, point out analysts. “With expectation of a further rise in debt (pending capex of ₹5000 crore amidst weak earnings outlook) and continued overhang of capital allocation to group companies, we now assume a higher 60% holding company discount (50% earlier) to value its key holdings,"" said analysts from Edelweiss Securities Ltd in report on 13 June."

Consolidated revenue for the quarter, however, dropped to ₹19,902 crore from ₹22,431 crore in the same period of previous fiscal while consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) dipped to ₹3,243 crore from ₹3,999 crore. Consolidated revenue and EBITDA for the FY20 stood at ₹77,625 crore and ₹13,846 crore respectively. Consolidated profit after tax ₹4,425 crore recorded a growth of 161 per cent year-on-year aided by write-back of deferred tax liabilities and lower exceptional charge in the current year. On a standalone basis, revenue and EBITDA for FY20 declined on account of general economic slowdown and start of the lockdown in major economies of the world during the month of March, the company said. Despite the economic slowdown, the company generated net cash flow from operations of ₹3,519 crore on a standalone basis in FY20 (before meeting its capex spend of over ₹2,800 crore) on the back of efficient operations and working capital management during the year. On a standalone basis, the company continues to maintain a comfortable liquidity position with liquid investments of ₹2,093 crore as on March 31. The board of directors has recommended a dividend of ₹4 per share. The total outflow on account of the dividend will be ₹263 crore. In terms of the provisions of the Finance Act 2020, dividend will be taxed in the hands of shareholders at applicable rates of tax and the company will withhold tax at source appropriately. Grasim said it has been in the process of executing total capex plan of ₹7,800 crore (at standalone level) for raising capacities in both the viscose fibre and chemical businesses apart from ongoing modernisation capex at various plants. The capex plans are currently being reviewed in the context of the current economic environment.

Grasim Industries had reported a net loss of ₹1,319.79 crore in the September quarter a year ago, Grasim Industries said in a BSE filing. Its revenue from operation was at ₹18,430.27 crore, up 3%, during the quarter under review as against ₹17,892.42 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. ""Consolidated EBITDA at ₹3,180 crore recorded a growth of 7% Y-o-Y and PAT (before exceptional items and one-time deferred tax benefit) was up by 6% Y-o-Y to ₹639 crore driven by superior performance of the company's subsidiaries, UltraTech Cement Limited and Aditya Birla Capital Limited.

""The weakness in the domestic VSF realisations impacted this quarter's profitability. The benefit of falling input costs like pulp prices will get reflected in the coming quarters due to inventory time lag,"" said Grasim Industries. While, its cement business UltraTech' revenue was at ₹9,620.47 crore, up 4.01%, as against ₹9,249.26 crore. ""UltraTech completed the acquisition of Century Textiles and Industries cement business... With this acquisition, UltraTech's cement manufacturing capacity stands augmented to 117.4 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), including its overseas capacity. This makes UltraTech the 3rd largest cement company in the world, outside of China,"" the company said. Revenue from Chemicals during the quarter was at ₹1,347.30 crore, down 16.44%, as against ₹1,612.38 crore. ""Softening of Caustic Soda prices globally has led to decline in the domestic prices, resulting in lower profitability on YoY basis,"" said Grasim.

Revenue from others segment was at ₹1,305.60 crore, up 13.32%, as against ₹1,152.10 crore. On the outlook, Grasim said its VSF business will continue to focus on expanding the market in India and its chemical business is under an expansion mode for both chlor-alkali and specialty chemicals. On UltraTech, it said: ""The company with its presence across the country is the best positioned to take advantage of the revival in cement demand, despite the anomalies that may get created in demand patterns in some parts of the country due to extraneous reasons.""""Grasim is incurring capex to increase capacities across its key business lines and is potentially well positioned to leverage the next phase of the economic growth,"" the company said.

The order comes at a time when Indian banks grapple with mounting non-performing assets and have seen their valuations erode. On Thursday, Yes Bank ended 5.8% lower, State Bank of India 4.7%%, Indusind Bank 4%, RBL Bank 3%, Federal Bank 2.8%. BSE Bankex fell 1.2%. Shares of Grasim Industries, which has an exposure to the telecom sector via its 11.55% stake in Vodafone Idea, slumped 5%. The order is a huge blow to private telcos, who have been running losses for the past many quarters and show no signs of making money in the near future. Vodafone Idea slumped 22%, but Bharti Airtel pared losses and gained 3%. ""Bharti Airtel shares are up even though it will be impacted by the SC order; this is because investors are pricing in a two-player market, with the assumption that Vodafone Idea will not be able to survive under the weight of the penalty,"" said analysts at two domestic institutional brokerages requesting anonymity. AGR is the basis on which department of telecommunications (DoT) calculates levies payable by operators and it has been a bone of contention between the telcos and the government. Telecom operators are liable to pay around 3-5% and 8% of the AGR as spectrum usage charges and licence fees, respectively, to DoT. The matter had been under litigation for 14 years with operators arguing that AGR should comprise revenue from telecom services, but DoT insisting that AGR should include all revenues earned by an operator, including that from non-core telecom operations."

The company, which has inked a definitive agreement to acquire the business, said the transaction will be funded through internal accruals. KPR Industries’ chlor-alkali business comprises an under-construction 200 tonnes per day project at Balabhadrapuram, Andhra Pradesh. As part of the deal, Grasim would take over the assets and identified liabilities associated with the business. KPR Industries, on the other hand, will utilize the capital towards a full and final settlement of the lenders’ dues. “This acquisition is a strategic fit, and further strengthens our group’s leadership in the chlor-alkali sector. Caustic soda is a critical input in the aluminium sector. Given the expansion plans for the aluminium businesses, it will serve as an excellent sourcing point for leading aluminium players,"" Birla Carbon Business chief executive officer Santrupt B. Misra said in a statement. The acquisition is in line with Grasim’s strategy to strengthen operations on the east coast of the country, said the company. “Further, the purchase of a partially-completed project vis-a-vis a greenfield project will translate into a shorter time-to-market,"" it added. Once operationalized, the project, along with other ongoing expansion projects, will enhance Grasim’s caustic soda capacity to 1.22 million tonnes per annum. Caustic soda is one of the essential inputs for the manufacture of alumina. It is also used widely in various other industries—viscose staple fibre, water treatment, pharma, chemicals, etc. The chlor-alkali division of Grasim is already operating seven chlor-alkali plants across India.

Ebitda in its stand-alone business rose an impressive 36% year-on-year to ₹ 1,070 crore. But Grasim’s fortunes aren’t merely determined by the performance of the viscose staple fibre and chemicals businesses. It is also a holding company that houses stakes in cement, telecom and financial services firms within the Aditya Birla Group. Investors’ latest worry is that Grasim’s 11.55% stake in Vodafone Idea Ltd is proving to be a bigger drag than what they had feared. The telecom firm announced fundraising plans worth ₹ 25,000 crore on Wednesday, and Grasim’s share is likely to be around ₹ 2,900 crore. “Grasim would like to maintain its current stake in the company as it finds current valuations in the telecom sector very attractive. It will also consider the valuations while deciding on subscription to any rights issue by Vodafone Idea,"" analysts at Edelweiss wrote in a note to clients after attending Grasim’s conference call with investors. As it is, the company has had to write down its investment in Vodafone Idea by about ₹ 2,000 crore, thanks to the huge drop in the telecom firm’s valuations this year. Investors’ reaction to the fundraising plans clearly show they see it as good money going after bad. Not only did Grasim’s shares fall on Thursday, but even Vodafone Idea’s shares fell by more than 10%. This is despite the news that the promoters are planning to bring in $2.5 billion to strengthen the company’s balance sheet. It’s likely that the company may need to infuse capital into Aditya Birla Capital Ltd as well to support its growth. These potential capital commitments are likely to act as an overhang on the Grasim stock, says analysts at Edelweiss. For investors, it simply means there is no easy way to benefit from the growth in the core business. Grasim’s various other commitments and connections mean that there are various other risks to consider while buying the stock. It’s little wonder that the viscose staple fibre and the chemicals business are valued at a high discount. After applying a 50% haircut, the value of its various holdings in group firms adds up to about ₹ 43,000 crore. With Grasim’s market cap at ₹ 53,000 crore currently, this means the core business is valued at about 4.2 times estimated earnings for the year till March 2020, using earnings estimates from Edelweiss."

Updated: 24 May 2018,Competition commission orders probe against Grasim Industries,https://www.livemint.com/Companies/ndACR2LIsuyRb3Z8qAUMEL/Competition-commission-orders-probe-against-Grasim-Industrie.html," New Delhi: The Competition Commission has ordered a probe against Aditya Birla group firm Grasim Industries for alleged abuse of dominant position with regard to the sale of viscose staple fibre (VSF). The ruling has come following three separate complaints filed with the fair trade regulator. Since the “subject matter"" of the three complaints was same, CCI had clubbed them and passed a common order. After finding prima-facie evidence of competition norm violations, the regulator has directed its investigation arm — the Director General (DG) — to conduct an investigation against the company. The allegations pertained to the conduct of Grasim Industries in imposing discriminatory conditions on sale of VSF, monitoring the customers by collecting details of their consumption, production and sales and practising unfair policies with respect to discounts offered, among others. For the cases, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) considered the market for “provision for sale of viscose stable fibre in India"" as the relevant one. In its order dated 16 May, CCI observed that Grasim Industries is “offering various discounts/ incentives/ rebates, inter alia quantity discount, continuity discount, umbrella discount, comfort blend discount etc"". Before giving discounts, the firm compels its customers to disclose information regarding their production capacities, list of their suppliers, buyers, their turnover, and balance sheet as a pre-condition for supply of VSF, CCI said. Noting that Grasim Industries is able to impose such conditions on the VSF buyers owing to its “dominance in the VSF market in India"", CCI said the company appears to be “prima facie"" violating the provisions of Section 4 of the Competition Act. Section 4 pertains to abuse of dominant market position. One of the complainants had alleged that the firm had arbitrarily withdrawn all sales terms (credits and discounts) agreed between the two parties and ultimately refused to supply VSF to it. CCI said that the withdrawal of sales terms and discounts would leave the product of the complainant at a price point at which no takers would be available. The complainant appears to be discriminated vis-à-vis similarly placed customers to whom discount is being provided by Grasim Industries, the regulator added. “... nothing stated in this order shall tantamount to final expression of opinion on the merits of the case and the DG shall conduct the investigation without being swayed in any manner whatsoever by the observations made herein,"" CCI said. Under the Competition Commission of India (General) Regulations, the regulator had granted confidentiality over the identity of the three complainants, as per the order."

On a standalone basis, the total capex for Grasim Industries’ textile business stands at Rs6,427 crore, which is to be utilised by the company till financial year 2021, Aditya Birla Group’s chief financial officer Sushil Agarwal said. “The board of directors (of the company) today also approved an additional Rs1,000 crore investment into the chemical business, taking Grasim Industries’ standalone capex plan (for its textile business) to Rs7,427 crore (till FY2021),"" Agarwal said. Grasim Industries, which also includes the group’s cement business, UltraTech, will invest Rs5,900 crore on capex to modernise its existing cement plants and carry out environmental upgradation and ramp up capacity of assets it acquired from Jaiprakash Associates. On a consolidated basis, Grasim Industries will invest more than Rs13,327 crore in capex into its textile and cement businesses till financial year 2021. “Cement plants belonging to Jaiprakash Associates were running at 15-20% capacity when we acquired them in June last year,"" Agarwal said, adding that the Kumar Mangalam Birla-led company has been able to turn around the assets and run them at 75% capacity in less than a year. “On average, Indian cement plants run at 75% capacity. However, UltraTech plants run at over 85% capacity,"" Agarwal said. “The aim is to run Jaiprakash Associates’ cement plant at over 85% capacity in future,"" he said. Grasim Industries plans to fund almost the capex from its cash flows, but it could look to raise debt if the circumstances require the company to do so. “Grasim Industries, having generated Rs3,500 crore as EBITDA during FY18, has surplus cash on its balance sheet. Our balance sheet also allows us an option to raise up to Rs12,000 crore in debt to grow, in case of a short-term mismatch,"" Agarwal said, adding that the priority of the company would be to fund its capital expenditure from its cash flows. Grasim Industries on Wednesday reported a consolidated net profit of Rs853.62 crore for the quarter ended March 2018. Revenue rose 47.8 % at Rs4,605.55 crore during the same period. The company is expected to focus on its viscose staple fibre (VSF) business to register growth and expand its market in India. “Viscose is eating out of other fiber markets. Our domestic fiber business has grown by 22% (annually) during the March 2018 quarter,"" said Grasim’s managing director Dilip Gaur, adding that the bulk of the growth in the textile business is expected to come from the company’s VSF business in the future. Meanwhile, the merger of Idea Cellular, the telecom arm of the Aditya Birla Group, with the Indian arm of global telecom major Vodafone Plc, is expected to be completed soon. “The Idea-Vodafone merger is on track and should happen soon though it is very difficult to put a date on it as the final approval is pending with the department of telecommunications,"" said Sushil Agarwal, adding that he is hopeful that the consumption in the country would pick up over the next couple of years."

According to the proposal, Birla Cellulosic will undertake the proposed expansion within the existing plant area in 242.81 hectare. The estimated project cost is Rs1,800 crore. The company wants to expand its VSF production capacity to meet the increased demand of man-made fibres in the country. The other products presently manufactured include sulphuric Acid, carbon disulphide and sodium sulphate. The Solven Spun Cellulosic Fibre unit and coal-based captive power plant are yet to be commissioned."
