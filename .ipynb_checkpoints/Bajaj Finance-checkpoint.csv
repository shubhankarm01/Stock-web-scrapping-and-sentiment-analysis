Both Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Finance were top gainers of Sensex with an upside of more than 4.5% each, followed by other heavyweights like HUL, Maruti Suzuki, Asian Paint, and Titan.

Bajaj Finance's core assets under management (AUM) bettered at ₹204,000 crore as of June 2022 compared to ₹156,115 crore as of June 2021.

Updated: 06 Jul 2022,Four benefits you can enjoy with a Bajaj Finance Senior Citizen FD,https://www.livemint.com/brand-stories/four-benefits-you-can-enjoy-with-a-bajaj-finance-senior-citizen-fd-11657083561545.html,"As the Indian economy recovers, traditional investors now have the option to extract value from trusted instruments like the fixed deposit. The recent RBI repo rate hike is among the key factors, and it has led several top issuers to improve their offerings. One particularly smart option is the Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit. Investors of all ages now enjoy some of the highest FD rates in the market, with special benefits for senior citizens. It is primarily because the senior citizen FD allows you to get an enhanced rate, thus ensuring higher returns. However, besides the FD rates, the Bajaj Finance Senior Citizen FD also has several other special benefits. These allow you to invest easily and ensure you enjoy a convenient experience without worrying about the returns. For a detailed breakdown of the features on offer, read on. Enhanced FD rates The FD rates you get dictate your total earnings. Higher rates lead to better earnings, so you must pick issuers accordingly. With a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit, you get some of the highest rates in the market, as regular investors can get interest rates up to 7.50% p.a. However, a special benefit ofthe senior citizen FD is that you get an additional 0.25% on the base rate offered. This notable increase can significantly increase your total earnings, especially if you invest over a lengthy tenor. To help you better understand the difference and how you stand to earn significantly more as a senior citizen investor, take a look at the following tables. Consider cumulative FD investments of Rs.3 lakh, Rs.5 lakh, and Rs.10 lakh; all booked at a common tenor of 44 months.

Another flexible feature is that you can opt for a tenor for up to 60 months. You can book your FD for anywhere between 12 and 60 months based on your goals and requirements. However, you must remember that a long-term senior citizen FD will fetch significantly greater returns than a short-term FD. It is mainly due to interest compounding, which causes you to earn generously the longer you stay invested. The easiest way to compare and understand the effects of compounding is to use the FD calculator. By increasing the tenor, you will notice that you can earn handsomely, even if you improve the duration by just one year. Multiple payout options to align with any investing goals Adding the convenience on offer, senior citizens can invest in a Bajaj Finance Senior Citizen FD and get interest payouts based on their requirements. You can choose either a non-cumulative or cumulative FD, based on which you get your interest earnings at maturity or periodically.

For senior citizen investors, a non-cumulative FD can be a wise choice as it helps create a steady income stream. The earnings can quickly help you address monthly expenses, so long as you invest wisely. The interest rate offered to senior citizens for different payout options is mentioned below: Special interest rates are also offered for specific tenors: Do note that a non-cumulative FD will have lower FD rates as compared to a cumulative FD.

Updated: 01 Jul 2022,Consumer durable firms likely to raise prices due to GST rate hike,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/consumer-durable-firms-likely-to-raise-prices-due-to-gst-rate-hike-these-two-stocks-top-picks-11656682041811.html,"From July 18, the GST rate on LED Lamps, lights, and fixtures will be at 18% from the current 12%. This GST hike on these items is likely to impact the earnings of consumer durable companies. To pass on the additional costs, firms are expected to raise prices on their products however demands will face the brunt. Among top picks are Havells India and Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals in the sector. In their latest meeting, Finance Ministry said that ""all rate changes recommended by the 47th GST Council will be made effective from 18th July 2022."" Among many goods and services, the council has recommended hiking the GST rate on items like LED Lamps, lights, and fixtures, their metal printed circuits board - to 18% from 12%. Research analysts, Aniruddha Joshi, Manoj Menon, Karan Bhuwania, and Pranjal Garg at ICICI Securities in their report said, ""We believe any increase in taxes in a highly competitive segment like lighting may impact the industry profitability. Smaller/unorganised companies are likely to gain market shares. As most durable companies have raised prices by more than 20% in past 18 months, any further price hikes may impact volumes and /or may result in down-trading."" ""We believe most durable companies will be required to raise prices to pass on additional costs,"" analysts said. According to ICICI Securities analysts, the increase in the GST rate is likely to happen when inflation is already high. Most durable companies have raised prices by over 20% in the past 18 months. They said, ""We believe any further increase in prices may hurt demand or it may result in down-trading in the sector. We also believe the smaller/ unorganised sector will be able to gain some market share."" Talking about the impact on durable companies, the analysts said key companies that generate more than 20% revenue from lighting are Crompton, Bajaj Electricals, and Orient. Other companies such as Dixon and Havells also generate 12% and 10% of revenues from lighting, respectively. ""Any increase in taxes will have a 2-5% impact on earnings,"" they said. Further, the analysts added that considering the strong return ratios, healthy growth potential, and low penetration levels, ""we remain structurally positive on the white goods and durables sector."" Also, they said, ""We also expect the migration from unorganised to organised sector to steadily generate value."" ""Havells India and Crompton Greaves are our top picks,"" ICICI Securities analysts said. ICICI Securities have kept a buy recommendation on Havells for a target price of ₹1,644 apiece. While keeping a buy opinion on Crompton, the analysts have set a target of ₹504 apiece for the company. On Thursday, Havells stock closed at ₹1,110.30 apiece up by ₹10.60 or 0.96% on BSE. At the current market price, it has a market valuation of ₹69,561.19 crore. Meanwhile, Crompton finished at ₹349.85 apiece up by 2.78% on the same exchange. At the current market price, Crompton's market valuation stood at ₹22,168.05 crore. In a year, Havells stock has climbed by 12.29%, however, Crompton's stock has plunged by over 18.41%. On July 1st last year, Havells stock was around ₹988.9 apiece and Crompton around ₹428.8 apiece on BSE. Among the key risks, ICICI Securities analysts said a higher-than-expected rise in crude oil prices, any delay in price hikes to protect margins, and irrational competition."
Updated: 01 Jul 2022,Small savings schemes – an island in an ocean of rising rates,https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/small-savings-schemes-an-oasis-in-an-ocean-of-rising-rates-11656664907535.html,"Expectations were high, and probably rightly so, that the Ministry of Finance would announce a hike in the small savings scheme (SSS) interest rates. With the central bank finally hiking repo rate to 4.9%, and yields on G-Sec or government securities also surging on inflation and other concerns, SSS rates too were expected to follow suit. But the rates on these schemes, which are reviewed every quarter, were left unchanged, once again, for the July-September, 2022 quarter. These rate revisions were announced on 30 June. Small savings schemes include many popular schemes such as the Post Office time deposits, the Public Provident Fund (PPF), the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) and the National Savings Certificate (NSC), among others. Deposit rates rising Ever since the Reserve Bank of India hiked the repo rate, many banks and NBFCs have undertaken deposit rate increases. Many of them have announced even more than one hike in the course of the last two months.  Data from BankBazaar shows that many public sector banks and private sector banks have hiked rates on less than one-year deposit rates by 10-75 bps and 20-100 bps, respectively between April 1 and June 24. Several public and private sector banks have hiked the rates for their 1- to 2-year deposits by 15-35 bps and 10-75 bps, respectively and for 2- to 3-year deposits, by 15-35 bps and 20-50 bps, respectively. NBFCs such as Bajaj Finance, Shriram Transport Finance and HDFC too have hiked their deposit rates in recent times. Bajaj Finance, for example, has hiked interest rates thrice since May. Impacted by rising inflation concerns, bond yields too have been heading northwards. The benchmark 10-year G-Sec yield has risen by over 100 bps to around 7.4% year-to-date. On the other hand, interest rates on the SSS have remained static since the last cut on 31 March 2020. The 1-,2- and 3-year Post Office time deposits offer 5.5% and the 5-year time deposits offer 6.7%. The SCSS, which comes with a five-year lock-in, offers 7.4%. As bank and NBFC deposit rates inch up further, the SSS may start looking less attractive on returns. These schemes may, though, still hold investor interest because of the tax benefits enjoyed by some of them (such as PPF and SCSS) and their high degree of safety given their sovereign backing. Then and now Small savings schemes have been an attractive investment option in the past when interest rates were declining. This was because, despite the rates on SSS becoming market-linked (linked to G-Sec yields of similar tenure) from April 2016, these were not pared despite the repo rate cuts by the RBI and the fall in G-sec yields during that period. Today, with the interest rate upcycle having begun, it is likely that the revision in SSS rates may not keep up pace with the rising rates. They may move up, but possibly, only with a lag."

Updated: 30 Jun 2022,"Bajaj Finance hikes rates on deposits, yet again",https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/bajaj-finance-hikes-rates-on-deposits-yet-again-11656609961166.html,"Bajaj Finance, a non-banking financial company (NBFC), has hiked interest rates on fixed deposits (FDs) across various tenures, with effect from 1 July. This is the third deposit rate hike by Bajaj Finance since May. With this, rates on its FDs across different tenures are up by 30-45 basis from that announced in May. The hike will apply to deposits, both new and those being renewed. Bajaj Finance’s deposits enjoy the highest credit rating of AAA/ Stable by CRISIL and AAA (Stable) by ICRA. Deposits with NBFCs are not covered under the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation’s insurance cover of up to ₹5 lakh. However, a higher credit rating does offer some level of comfort. What’s on offer Bajaj Finance offers cumulative and non-cumulative FDs (the latter with monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and annual interest pay-outs) of the following tenures: 12-23 months, 24-35 months and 36-60 months. Apart from this, it also offers specific-tenure deposits such as 15-month, 18-month and 22-month deposits, that offer slightly higher rates than its similar-tenure deposits. For example, the 15-month cumulative FD offers 6.4%, versus 6.2% on the 12-23 months FD.   After the latest hike, among Bajaj Finance’s deposits, the 44-month cumulative and non-cumulative FD (with annual interest payout) offer the highest rate of 7.5%. Senior citizens will be offered a higher rate of 7.75% on these deposits. They get an additional 0.25% interest rate on all Bajaj Finance deposits. Another NBFC, Shriram Transport Finance (STFC), too, revised its deposits rates in May. Rates offered by STFC on deposits of certain tenures are higher than those offered by Bajaj Finance (see table). For cumulative deposits, while interest is compounded annually in the case of Bajaj Finance, it is compounded monthly in case of STFC. This makes the effective rate of return on STFC’s deposits even higher. However, STFC’ FDs are rated AA+ (Stable) by ICRA and AA+/ Stable by India Ratings and Research, a notch lower than the rating for Bajaj Finance’s deposits. Interest income from fixed deposits is taxed at your income tax slab rate. This makes them most suitable for only those in the lower tax brackets."

During these days, investors' wealth on BSE climbed by ₹7,40,977.89 crore. BSE market cap stood at ₹234,86,923.67 crore on June 20 and jumped to ₹242,27,901.56 crore on June 24. Research Analysts - Dharmesh Shah, Nitin Kunte, CMT, Pabitro Mukherjee, and Vinayak Parmar at ICICI Securities in their technical note said, equity benchmarks behaved contrary to our expectations as downbeat global cues tracking anxiety around rising inflation globally, rate hikes weighed on investor sentiments. On Nifty 50, they said the velocity of the decline accelerated on breach of March low of 15700 and drifted further to the 15200 mark. Going forward, the analysts said, ""We expect the index to gradually resolve higher and extend pullback towards the 16600 regions in coming months wherein strong support is placed in the vicinity of 14800-14600 zone, which we expect to hold as it is 80% retracement of CY-21 rally (13596-18604), at 14600. Thus, dips should be utilised to construct a portfolio by accumulating quality stocks in a staggered manner."" ICICI Securities analysts' positive bias is based on four factors: 1. The reading of the percentage of stocks above 200 DMA below 15 signifies extreme pessimism in the markets that eventually leads to a technical pullback to the tune of a minimum of 10% in the subsequent three months. 2. Index has already corrected 18% from the life highs and has approached oversold reading on the weekly momentum oscillator. The weekly RSI has approached its lowest level (placed at 35) since May 2020. Historically, a reading of 35 on weekly RSI has produced a decent pullback, and the analysts expect this rhythm to maintain in the coming months. 3. India continues to relatively outperform the EM basket even in the ongoing corrective phase despite significant selling by FIIs. Over the past one year, while the MSCI EM index has corrected over 40% from highs, India has relatively outperformed as the benchmark corrected only 18%. 4. The India VIX and crude oil prices have cooled off from the recent swing high. Indian Equities have an inverse correlation with the India VIX. Thus, providing impetus for the acceleration of ongoing pullback. They added, ""On the broader market front, in three instances over the past decade, intermediate correction in the Nifty Midcap, Small cap indices have been to the tune of 28% and 40%, respectively. At present, both indices have corrected 25% and 34%, respectively."" Therefore, the analysts said, ""any further correction is likely to be short-lived amid oversold territory and would set the stage for a technical pullback in coming weeks."" Here are the top picks of ICICI Securities analysts: BFSI - SBI, HDFC, Kotak Bank, Federal Bank, and Bajaj Finance. Telecom & Technology - Reliance, TCS, Infosys, L&T Infotech, HCL Technology, and Coforge. Capital goods - L&T, ABB, Siemens, BEL, AIA Engineering, ELGI Equipment, Sanghvi Movers, and Timken India. Consumption - Hindustan Unilever, Titan, ITC, Asian Paints, Tata Consumer, Havells India, Jubilant Foods, and Astral Poly. Auto - M&M, Maruti Suzuki, Ashok Leyland, Jamna Auto, Mahindra CIE, FIEM Industries, and Minda Industries. Infra and Realty - DLF LTD, Brigade Enterprise, and Phoenix Mills. Pharma & Chemicals - Divi's Laboratories, Cipla, Syngene, Torrent Pharma, and SRF Ltd. Metal - JSW Steel, Hindalco, and Graphite. Others - Adani Port, Indian Hotels, Zee Entertainment, Trent, Concor, Nocil, Balrampur Chinni, BDL, Bluedart, Dixon Technologies, Kansai Nerolac, and NRB Bearing. Markets weekly outlook: For the week June 27 to July 1, ICICI Direct analysts expect Nifty to eventually resolve past falling channel placed at 15800 and gradually head towards 16200 levels in coming weeks. In expiry week, use dips towards 15400 to create long positions as the index is poised at extreme oversold readings. ICICI Direct analysts added that brent oil prices have breached the weekly rising trend line indicating a loss of momentum and ""we expect upsides to be capped in 125-130 zone."" According to ICICI Direct analysts, amongst sectors preferences, IT, and BFSI are key sectors with favourable risk/reward, while Auto and Capital goods are expected to extend outperformance. The analysts prefer - SBI, HDFC, Kotak Bank, TCS, Maruti Suzuki, ITC, and Titan in large caps while in midcaps we like KPIT Technologies, Federal Bank, AIA Engineering, NRB Bearings, Ashok Leyland, Automotive Axles, Bharat Electronics, Havells, Trent, and Indian Hotel. Yesha Shah, Head of Equity Research, Samco Securities said, ""The coming week has a host of events arriving which could affect the mood of the market. Globally, investors will keenly analyze the US quarterly GDP growth rate numbers. The USA would officially enter into a recession if they post a negative growth and thus this could have a spill-over effect on global markets."" ""In India, the vehicle sales figures will continue to fuel stock-specific moves on D-Street as investors attempt to decipher the future trend,"" Shah added, ""Moreover, the monthly F&O expiry in the second half of the week may cause volatility in the indices. Investors are thus advised to accumulate good stocks with strong fundamentals, free cash flows, and lower leverage over the long run while disregarding short-term difficulties."""

Shares were higher in Europe and Asia on Friday despite data suggesting some economies are slowing. Shares rose in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and South Korea.  Indian indices on Friday closed higher, led by good buying support in telecom, financial and auto stocks. The Sensex gained 462.26 points, or 0.88%, to close at 52,727.98, while Nifty50 added 142.60 points to end at 15,699.25.

On the Nifty50 index, M&M, Hero MotoCorp, and IndusInd Bank registered the biggest gains, while TechM, Infosys, and Apollo Hospitals were the biggest laggards.   The US dollar slipped on Friday and headed for its first weekly decline of June as traders dialled down bets on where interest rates might peak and brought forward the timing of rate cuts to counter a possible recession. A significant shift this week has been the fall in oil and commodity prices, which has eased inflation fears and allowed equity markets to rebound. This has eroded the safe-haven bid that's been boosting the greenback against major currencies.   Crude oil futures on Friday declined by 0.54 per cent to ₹8,178 per barrel as participants trimmed their positions on low demand. On the Multi Commodity Exchange, crude oil for July delivery fell by ₹44 or 0.54 per cent to ₹8,178 per barrel with a business volume of 3,881 lots. Globally, West Texas Intermediate crude oil was trading 0.09 per cent lower at USD 104.36 per barrel and Brent crude was 0.04 per cent down at USD 110.09 per barrel in New York.

On the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold contracts for August delivery traded lower by ₹46 or 0.09 per cent at ₹50,548 per 10 grams in a business turnover of 12,159 lots.

Cottonseed oil cake prices on Friday declined by ₹3 to ₹2,597 per quintal in futures trade as participants reduced their bets tracking a weak trend in spot market. On the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange, cottonseed oil cake for July delivery fell by ₹3 or 0.12 per cent to ₹2,597 per quintal with an open interest of 78,700 lots.

On the Multi Commodity Exchange, copper contracts for July delivery eased by ₹4.85 or 0.69 per cent to ₹693.40 per kg in a business turnover of 5,507 lots.

Shares were higher in Europe and Asia on Friday despite data suggesting some economies are slowing. U.S. futures also advanced after a rally Thursday on Wall Street, where the market is headed for its first weekly gain after three weeks of punishing losses. Market players are looking ahead to U.S. inflation data due next week and hoping that the moderation in prices of oil and some other commodities this week is a sign inflation might be abating.   Rating: BUY | CMP: Rs354 | TP: Rs435 LIC Housing Finance (LICHF) saw a good quarter with a positive surprise on PAT led by beat on all fronts barring loan growth, that was a miss as volumes were impacted due to third covid wave. The company guided that disbursals could grow by 15% in FY23 and builder loans could see an uptick that might contribute 5-10% to credit flow. NII was ahead due to higher NIM driven by lower funding cost. Benefit of borrowing cost could continue, that might cushion NIM considering that fixed rate liabilities contribute 53% and interest rates could harden. Asset quality improved with GNPA/NNPA reducing QoQ by 40bps each led by better recoveries. LICHF performed well in H2FY22 while valuation at 0.8x is attractive. We maintain multiple at 1.0x FY24 ABV but slightly raise TP to Rs435. Upgrade from ACCUMULATE to BUY.   Global equity investors may be excited to see green on their screens this week but stock gains seem to be a function of a stronger shift toward defensives rather than a full-throated risk-on roar. A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. index of defensive stocks including megacap tech and healthcare names has climbed to more than an 18-month high relative to the MSCI AC World Index, as fears of a global recession outweigh concern over sky-high inflation. The gauge has jumped over 4% this week, double the rise in the global stocks benchmark -- itself on track for its first weekly gain in four. Investors are beginning to consider the consequences of a Federal Reserve that seems willing to hike the world’s largest economy into recession to defeat inflation. Chair Jerome Powell has called his commitment to curbing price rises “unconditional,"" giving a boost to havens like Treasuries this week and providing a fresh impetus for defensives to outperform.   India's retail inflation is likely to breach the mandated inflation target band of 2-6% for three straight quarters but is showing indications of peaking, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) deputy governor Michael Patra said on Friday.   A day after the central government revised its fiscal deficit target for FY2023 and stated it will limit it to the current year's numbers Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram criticised the government over the state of the Indian economy, asking if it was in the ""pink of health"" over high fiscal deficit, inflation, and the depreciating value of the rupee.   Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Michael D Patra on Friday said the Central Bank will not allow ""jerky movements"" of Rupee and stressed that the Indian currency has witnessed least depreciation in recent times.   Once seen as an attractive inflation hedge due to its limited supply, the ongoing turmoil in cryptocurrencies is likely to make investors sceptical about it.   Multibagger stocks: Adani Green Energy shares have delivered stellar 6,200 per cent return in last 10 years   Stocks rose in Asia on Friday following another rally on Wall Street as investors try to process central bank moves to fight soaring inflation and the growing possibility that those measures will induce a recession. Global markets have been thrown into turmoil for months by a perfect storm of crises that have left observers predicting a sharp contraction, including the Ukraine war, China's lockdown-induced economic troubles, supply chain snarls and spiking energy costs. Expectations that the Federal Reserve and other central banks will have to keep lifting rates have left many traders fretting that the pain could go on for some time, with sovereign bond yields -- key gauges to future rates -- continuing to climb.   Oil prices edged higher amid a volatile trading session on Friday, as supply uncertainty outweighed fears of slower demand from cooling U.S. economic activity. Brent crude futures climbed 31 cents, or 0.3%, at $110.36 a barrel by 0630 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 59 cents, or 0.6%, at $104.86 a barrel.   European stocks rebounded at the open Friday following another week of heavy losses for markets, including oil, on heightened fears of a global recession. London's benchmark FTSE 100 index gained 0.4 percent to 7,047.11 points, with investors brushing aside bruising defeats for Britain's ruling Conservatives in by-elections Thursday. The pound was little changed against the dollar and euro, also despite data showing a drop in UK retail sales volumes as inflation soars. In the eurozone, Frankfurt's DAX index won 0.3 percent to 12,947.75 points and the Paris CAC 40 gained 0.7 percent to 5,922.45.   The Central government is reportedly going to become the biggest shareholder of debt-ridden Vodafone Idea Limited, according to CNBT-TV18. The Centre may hold 33% around in the company and become the single largest shareholder in the third-largest telco in the country, as per the business news channel.   Jet Airways began its operational hiring and asked its former cabin crew members to rejoin the airline.   As surging inflation and the end of global easy-money policies send Indian stocks spiraling down from all-time highs, three charts show the pain is unlikely to end anytime soon.. The selloff comes as climbing costs and a record plunge in the rupee have forced the nation’s central bank to join global peers in raising interest rates.   The US dollar slipped against its major peers on Friday, on course for its first weekly decline this month as investors continue to assess the path for Federal Reserve policy and whether aggressive rate hikes would trigger a recession. The safe-haven currency also lost support amid improved market sentiment, which saw regional stock markets rise and buoyed riskier currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rivals, sank 0.2% to 104.19 in Asia. That undid the previous day's 0.19% rise, which was driven mostly by a decline in the euro after weak European factory data reduced bets for European Central Bank tightening.   Shares of Nazara Technologies rallied about 20% to ₹623 apiece on the BSE in Friday's trading session as the stock started trading ex-bonus ahead of its record date for the bonus shares issue. Bonus shares are fully paid additional shares issued by a company to its existing shareholders.   Dividend paying stock REC Ltd is going to consider issuance of bonus shares on 30th June 2022. In its meeting on 30th June 2022, board of directors of REC Limited will consider the proposal for issue of bonus shares to the equity shareholders of the company. The board is expected to decide ratio of bonus shares in this meeting as well. Bonus shares, if approved, will be another good news for shareholders as the company has already given interim dividend of ₹6 per equity share for the financial year 2022.   The selling in Nifty has shown signs of slowing down this week, with the index consolidating within a 500-point range since Monday. In doing so, Nifty is now forming an inverse Head and Shoulder pattern on the hourly chart, which is a bullish pattern. The neckline of this pattern is placed near 15630-15650 levels. If the index sustains above this zone, the recovery could extend towards 15900-16170 in the next few sessions. On the downside, 15400-15370 now becomes the immediate support zone for Nifty.   Gold and silver prices in India struggled today amid weak global cues. On MCX, gold futures declined to near two-week lows of ₹50,510 per 10 gram. Silver futures were marginally higher at ₹59,510 per kg. In global markets, gold rates were flat at $1,824.72 per ounce and remained on course for their second straight weekly decline. So far this week, gold prices have dropped about 0.9%, on worries of aggressive rate hikes by global central banks to counter runaway inflation. Among other precious metals, spot silver rose 0.4% to $21.02 per ounce but is set for weekly loss.   In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin price today rose above $21,000 mark.

Updated: 17 Jun 2022,4 reasons why pre-approved loan offers are smart financing solutions,https://www.livemint.com/brand-stories/4-reasons-why-pre-approved-loan-offers-are-smart-financing-solutions-11655467501808.html,"Pre-approved offers have gained a lot of popularity over the last few years. You may find such offers for loans and various other forms of credit, and they make the entire process a lot smoother. One of the main reasons for this benefit is the rise of fintech. As the top financial players began to adopt the cutting-edge technology and the innovation it has to offer, such pre-approved loan offers became a lot more common. There are several reasons for this, with one being that retail borrowers are less of a lending risk, and so such offers are more readily offered. As a borrower, this is good news because it means that accessing credit has become a lot easier. You no longer need to be part of long-winding and tedious loan processes to get the funds you need. This is especially handy when there’s an urgent loan needed, as is normally the case when dealing with emergencies. If borrowed for the right reasons, a pre-approved loan can be one of the best credit solutions in the market. For more insight on the reasons why pre-approved offers are good financing options, read on. Quicker turnaround times One of the major advantages of a pre-approved loan is that you don’t have to apply for the loan. Lenders usually extend such offers to their existing customers. Such offers are based on your past dealings and history with the lender. Moreover, lenders already have your information on file, and so, you aren’t required to submit documentation either. All of these factors combined result in quicker turnaround times. In fact, certain lenders guarantee same-day disbursal, wherein you get access to funds within hours of availing the offer. Exclusive and often personalised terms Pre-approved offers are based on your existing relationship with the issuer and your financial profile. Lenders consider your current financial standing and your credit profile before extending an offer. As such, pre-approved offers will keep getting updated based on your financial profile. For instance, if your credit score increases, you may get pre-approved for a much higher sanction and with lower rates as well. This is one of the key reasons to opt for such offers. In most cases, these terms are personalised to your profile and will be the best offers you can get with ease. What’s more, a pre-approved loan may be the most affordable short-term solution you may have access to. This comes in handy when you need instant affordable funding, be it for a business expense, an emergency or for any other reason. Increased flexibility and customisability Due to the fact that these offers are personalised, you often enjoy flexibility when it comes to certain loan terms. For instance, you may get to choose a tenor that better suits your goals, or you may even get a higher sanction compared to other instant funding options. The flexibility you get with pre-approved loans can make all the difference and helps ensure the loan never becomes a burden. Collateral-free sanction Pre-approved offers are usually extended for unsecured offerings like the personal loan. Meaning, you do not have to pledge any assets to the lender. You qualify based on your profile and need only avail the offer. What’s more, you can use the sanction as needed. There are no restrictions and it can help you meet any obligation. These are the top reasons why pre-approved loan offers are a good idea for most borrowers. All these benefits make it ideal for short-term goals. Additionally, with the right lender, repayment is a breeze and you never have to worry about defaulting on your payments. In fact, a great option to consider is the Bajaj Finserv Pre-approved Personal Loan. Get pre-approved offers for up to Rs. 10 lakh and opt for a tenor ranging between 24 and 60 months to enjoy hassle-free EMIs. In addition, you get a competitive interest rate and can have the sanction disbursed to your account in just 4 hours*. Select customers of Bajaj Finserv can avail of this pre-approved loan by completing a 100% online application without submitting any documents. These customers can get the money in their accounts as early as 30 minutes*. Generally, this offer is only available to existing customers, so check your pre-approved offer beforehand. With an offer, you usually do not need to submit additional documents, but in some cases, you may be asked to share basic KYC details, a cancelled cheque and bank account details. If required, you can upload your paperwork digitally and skip the trip to the branch.

Updated: 15 Jun 2022,"Sensex, Nifty end in the red; metals top drag, auto stocks soar",https://www.livemint.com/market/live-blog/share-market-live-updates-sensex-nifty-bse-nse-stock-market-today-15-06-2022-sbi-ntpc-airtel-asian-paints-11655257694674.html,"Indian equity markets were choppy on Wednesday on mixed global cues. Asian stock markets were mixed while Europe opened higher ahead of a Federal Reserve decision on how sharply to raise interest rates to cool U.S. inflation. London, Frankfurt and Shanghai advanced. Tokyo and Sydney declined. Oil prices edged lower. Wall Street futures were higher after the benchmark S&P 500 index lost 0.4% on Tuesday.  India’s benchmark indices ended lower for the fourth straight day on Wednesday, having swung between gains and losses through the session. Investors were largely focussed on the US Federal Reserve’s policy announcement, due later today. Traders expect the Fed rate hike to be three-quarters of a percentage point, or triple the usual margin. They worry aggressive action to cool inflation that is running at a four-decade high might tip the  world's largest economy into recession. US index futures gained along with stocks in Europe as policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic grapple with soaring inflation, slowing economic growth and volatile markets. Back home, Sensex fell 152.18 points to end the day at 52,541.39, while the broader Nifty shed 39.95 points to close at 15,692.15. Auto, capital goods, pharma, stocks rose, while power, IT, metal, oil & gas, realty and FMCG stocks witnessed selling. Midcap and smallcap indices ended higher.   Global oil demand will return to pre-pandemic levels next year as China's consumption recovers from Covid lockdowns, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday. Soaring oil prices and weaker economic growth will temper the growth of demand in the second half of this year, said the Paris-based agency. But ""resurgent Chinese oil consumption will more than compensate for a slowdown"" in oil demand among the 38-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that gathers mostly developed countries, the IEA said. China has enforced a zero-Covid policy that has led to lockdowns in Shanghai, its economic hub. The IEA expects global oil demand to grow to 99.4 million barrels per day in 2022 -- higher than its previous estimates but still one million barrels lower than in 2019. Demand is set to grow to 101.6 million barrels per day in 2023, according to the IEA, which advises developed countries on energy policy.   Nifty June series continues to trade with a negative bias – no strong reversal confirmation seen yet. Short term momentum parameters also suggest possibility of high volatility in the near term coinciding with the Fed decision on interest rates. Critical medium term trend support is seen at 15500 below which trend gets challenged. Advice being extremely selective for the near term.   DMRC has invited bids from 18 banks to raise loan to the tune of ₹2,700 cr for ""purchase of Airport Line assets,"" according to letters sent to these banks by the urban transporter. This comes in the backdrop of the Supreme Court early May upholding a Delhi High Court order directing the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to pay over ₹4,600 crore of arbitral award along with interest to the Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited (DAMEPL) in two equal installments in two months.   Shares of Tata Communications Ltd. slid to a new 52-week low of Rs856.25 on the NSE, on Wednesday after the company’s growth plans failed to enthuse its investors. At a recently held analysts' meet, the company’s management reiterated its strategy on platform transformation with a focus on innovations and new launches to boost revenue. The company has maintained its medium-term RoCE (return on capital employed) and operating margin guidance at 25-30% and 23-25%, respectively. However, no timeline was shared on its revenue growth target, which was a key disappointment. (Read here)   US index futures gained before a crucial Federal Reserve policy decision later Wednesday, with markets pricing in the biggest rate hike since 1994. Treasury yields dipped and the dollar retreated from a two-year high.  Stocks in Europe climbed, the euro strengthened and the region’s bonds advanced after the European Central Bank said it’s planning an unscheduled meeting Wednesday to tackle volatile market conditions. Officials will sign off on the reinvestment of bond purchases conducted under the now-halted pandemic emergency program.   As India faces a crippling surge in food and fuel prices, its policymakers will be counting mostly on this year's monsoon rains, not just interest rate hikes, to take inflationary pressure off the country's households and businesses.  Like its international peers, the Reserve Bank of India is expected to raise rates aggressively over the next year to take some of the heat out of prices, but the global drivers of the country's inflation mean there are limits to what domestic monetary policy can achieve, analysts say.  With 75% of India's price acceleration expected to come from food items, the focus for central bankers will be on the success of monsoon rains to boost production and replenish stockpiles, which would ease supply constraints and anchor price expectations. (Read here)   The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has ordered a four-month suspension in exports and re-exports of wheat and wheat flour originating from India, the world's second biggest producer of the grain, state news agency WAM said on Wednesday. The Gulf nation's economy ministry cited interruptions to global trade flows as the reason for its move, but added that India had approved exports of wheat to the UAE for domestic consumption.   India's merchandise exports in May rose by 20.55% to $38.94 billion, while trade deficit ballooned to a record $24.29 billion, according to the government data. Imports during May 2022 grew 62.83% on year to $63.22 billion, as per the data. Trade deficit stood at $6.53 billion in the same month last year. Cumulative exports in April-May rose about 25% to $78.72 billion, while imports during the period increased 45.4% to $123.41 billion.   Fitch Ratings expects India’s cement demand to rise by mid-to-high single digits over the medium term. This is after an estimated mid-teen rebound in the financial year ended March 2022 (FY22) from FY21 when demand declined by mid-single digits amid the Covid-19 pandemic.  We believe sustained GDP growth after the 8.7% recovery in FY22 will underpin growth across various construction end-markets. We expect cement demand from infrastructure and affordable housing markets to increase by low double digits, largely on the government’s growing impetus, evident from rising public spending and a significant project pipeline.  The rebound in urban housing activity in the last few quarters from multi-year cyclical lows will be sustained, in our view, leading to mid-to-high single-digit cement sales growth from the end-market. Similarly, a revival in corporate capex after a focus on cash conservation during 2020-2021 will support growth in industrial construction.  The impact of inflationary pressure on cement demand from the Russia-Ukraine war has been limited so far, but downside risks to our estimates will rise if macroeconomic conditions deteriorate significantly. We estimate the price hikes by cement producers will not fully counter the spike in energy prices since the start of the war. This will lead to markedly lower profitability in the April-June 2022 quarter.   GR Infraprojects has built an efficient business model powered by robust execution skills and delivered strong revenue growth with elevated margins.  However, recent development with regard to CBI’s raid would remain a key overhang on the stock’s performance. Till we get decent clarity, we revise our rating from BUY to REDUCE Target Price and Valuation: We value GRIL at | 1,080 based on SOTP valuation Key triggers for future price performance: Decent order book position and execution pick-up to translate into 12.4% topline CAGR over FY22-24E. Current order mix with built-in raw material price variation clauses provides margin sustainability at ~16%   Canara Bank's board of directors will meet on 24 June to consider and approve capital raising plan for FY23.   JSW Steel crude steel production in May on a standalone basis jumped 31% year-on-year to 17.89 lakh tonne, the company said on Wednesday. The flagship company of the $22 billion JSW Group said production of flat-rolled products rose 29% on year to 12.84 lakh tonne last month.   Muted quarter impacted by lower hospital profitability and higher losses from 24x7. Guided mid-teens revenue growth with +150 bps margins improvement for hospital segment in FY23. Apollo Hospitals consolidated EBIDTA grew by 11% to Rs4.1bn, below our estimate of Rs4.9bn, impacted by lower profitability in hospital segment and higher losses from 24x7. We expect hospital profitability to normalize from Q1FY23 while losses from 24x7 likely to remain at elevated levels in FY23.  We estimate 20% EBITDA CAGR over FY22-24E. Our FY23E & FY24E EBIDTA stands reduced by 11% and 7% as we factor in higher losses from 24x7. We value APHS on an SOTP basis. We ascribe 22x EV/EBITDA multiple to the hospital segment, 30x EV/EBITDA to offline pharmacy and 20x EV/EBITDA to AHLL. We ascribe zero value to the 24/7 business and arrive at a price target of Rs5,000 (Rs5,772 earlier). Recommend BUY rating.   The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday approved a proposal of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to conduct spectrum auction through which spectrum will be assigned to successful bidders for providing 5G services to public and enterprises. Digital connectivity has been an important part of policy initiatives of Government through its flagship programs such as Digital India, Start-up India, Make in India etc. A total of 72097.85 MHz of spectrum with a validity period of 20 years will be put to auction to be held by the end of July 2022. The auction will be held for spectrum in various Low (600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz), Mid (3300 MHz) and High (26 GHz) frequency bands. It is expected that the mid- and high-band spectrum will be utilised by telecom service providers to rollout 5G technology-based services capable of providing speed and capacities which would be about 10 times higher than what is possible through the current 4G services. There will no mandatory requirement to make upfront payment by successful bidders. Payments for spectrum can be made in 20 equal annual instalments to be paid in advance at the beginning of each year. This is expected to significantly ease cash flow requirements and lower the cost of doing business in this sector. The bidders would be given an option to surrender the spectrum after 10 years with no future liabilities with respect to balance instalments.

Forex traders said lacklustre domestic markets, elevated crude oil prices and persistent foreign capital outflows weighed on the local unit. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 77.99 against the dollar, registering a rise of 5 paise over its previous close. On Tuesday, the rupee had closed at its lifetime low of 78.04 against the US dollar.   Lately, inflation prints have been bearers of bad tidings, especially for equity investors. Adding to the already gloomy mood is the BofA Securities' recent global fund managers survey, highlighting dwindling hopes of a Fed pause on rate hikes. Fears of stagflation are at the highest since the 2008 financial crisis, while global growth optimism has sunk to a record low, showed the June survey report.

China's economy showed signs of recovery in May after slumping in the prior month as industrial production rose unexpectedly, but consumption was still weak and underlined the challenge for policymakers amid the persistent drag from strict COVID curbs. The data, however, provides a path to revitalise growth in the world's second-biggest economy after businesses and consumers were hit hard due to full or partial lockdowns in dozens of cities in March and April, including a protracted shutdown in commercial centre Shanghai. Industrial output grew 0.7% in May from a year earlier, after falling 2.9% in April, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Wednesday. That compared with a 0.7% drop expected by analysts in a Reuters poll.   ACTIONABLE IDEAS: NIFTY: BUY on Intraday declines till 15650, TGT 15750/15820, SL 15600.

The subdued closing assures the firmness of domestic market, wherein any sign of respite from the global bourses could trigger strong momentum hereon. In terms of technical levels, any breach below the mentioned support could drag the market towards the 15500 mark. At the same time, on the higher end, the 15850-15900 could be seen as immediate resistance followed by the psychological mark of 16000. We would advocate keeping a close tab on the global developments over the upcoming Fed policy meet that might dictate the near-term trend in the global market. Meanwhile, avoiding aggressive overnight bets and keeping a stock-centric approach to deal with such market conditions is advisable.

Sakhalin-1 produced around 271,000 barrels of oil per day in January and February 2022, according to the Russian Energy Ministry data, against the average of 227,000 bpd last year. Output has slipped after sanctions against Russia made it difficult to ship oil from the project. Production slipped to just over 60,000 barrels per day between May 1 and 15, Moscow-based news agency Interfax reported.   European equities slid to the lowest level since early March as investors worried that surging inflation will fuel more aggressive monetary tightening, increasing risks of a recession.

India, the world's biggest rice exporter, has ample stocks of rice and there is no plan to restrict exports, the top official at the food ministry said on Monday. India banned wheat exports in a surprise move last month. ""We have more than sufficient stocks of rice, so there is no plan to consider this,"" Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said responding to a question whether India would consider any curb on rice exports.

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Monday rejected Amazon's plea challenging the decision of fair trade regulator CCI to suspend the approval for the e-commerce major's deal with Future Coupons. The NCLAT said ""the appellant Amazon has not made full, whole, forthright and frank disclosures of relevant materials. It had furnished only limited disclosures pertaining to acquiring its strategic rights and interest in FRL (Future Retail Ltd)"" and executing the commercial contract. In December, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had suspended the approval given by it in 2019, for Amazon's deal to acquire a 49% in Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL). The regulator had said Amazon suppressed information while seeking clearances for the transaction back then and also slapped a fine of ₹202 crore on the company. This includes a ₹200 crore penalty for Amazon's to notify the combination in the requisite terms and two penalties of ₹one crore each for suppressing the actual scope and purpose of the combination. However, NCLAT slightly modified the orders of CCI and said the penalty of ₹one crore each imposed was ""on the higher side"" and reduced it to ₹50 lakh each.   Jeweller Rajesh Exports has agreed to invest $3 billion in India's southern Telangana state to set up the country's first electronic-display plant, the state government said late on Sunday.   Voltas struggled to generate positive economic value during FY22 due to a decade-low RoE. We note its EVA creation was impacted for first time in past decade. It also lost market share by 180bps in FY22 after gaining for a decade. Voltas Beko customer acceptance has increased and it reported 45% volume growth in FY22, to claim ~3% market share in home appliances segment. We model Voltas to report revenue and PAT CAGRs of 15.3% and 24.2% over FY22- FY24E, driven by: (1) high single-digit price hikes, and (2) likely market share recovery.  At current valuations, we believe stock price upside is capped. Hence, we maintain HOLD rating with a DCF-based target price of Rs1,033 (implied P/E 44x FY24E).   Weakness was seen in the equity market across the globe, led by higher-than-expected inflation data in the US market, leading to a rise in the bond yields. US bond yields are now trading above 3.15% levels, indicating the aggressive rate hike expectation by the US FED in the upcoming FOMC meeting, scheduled this week. The market is now eyeing the outcome of the FED meeting, and how the central bank influences the path of interest rates trajectory to maintain growth and inflation dynamics. In the domestic market, India's VIX rose by 11% led by weaker global cues, a stronger dollar, and the expectation of Hawkish commentary by the US FED. FII behaviour is likely to be volatile this week, and a clear trend is likely to emerge only after the volatility settles at a lower level for a longer time. Investors should focus on the asset allocation and use this volatility in a calibrated manner to build long-term positions in quality companies, where the earnings visibility is high.   Mumbai-based Keystone Realtors Ltd, which operates under the ‘Rustomjee’ brand, has filed a draft red herring prospectus with Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to raise up to ₹850 crore via an initial public offering (IPO). The initial share sale comprises a fresh issue of ₹700 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of up to ₹150 crore by its existing shareholders and promoters. The OFS consists of up to ₹75 crore worth share sale by chairman and managing director Boman Rustom Irani, up to ₹37.50 crore by Percy Soraji Chowdhry, and up to ₹37.50 crore by Chandresh Dinesh Mehta.   Of the nearly 81 World Trade Organization member countries, led by Singapore, seeking a ban on export restrictions for the World Food Programme at the ongoing ministerial underway in Geneva, most have not contributed to the United Nation’s programme, as per data. Although India has been opposing such a move to restrict its policy space to ensure domestic food security, it contributes to the WFP, and in fact was the highest contributor in 2015. (Read here)   Relaxo is the largest footwear manufacturer in India. It manufactures quality and affordable footwear comprising slippers, sandals, sports, and casual shoes. The company boasts of several popular brands including Relaxo, Sparx, Flite, and the Bahamas which stand as leaders in their respective domains. Its product mix comprises Hawai and Bahamas which account for ~25% of total sales value (60% shoes & 40% sandals) while Flite and Sparks account for ~37% of total sales each.  · Open footwear on a recovery track: The company’s Q4FY22 performance stood tepid, especially for the open footwear category (~75-80% of Relaxo’s sales). On a positive note, its closed footwear reported robust recovery on account of the opening of schools, colleges, and work offices. We believe a significant pent up demand will be released as the rural economy revives, thereby benefiting the company’s operating performance moving forward.  · Key catalyst: Normal Monsoon, Higher MSP: Normal monsoon forecast, the recent announcement of a hike in MSP, and higher remittances will be key catalysts aiding in the revival of the rural economy, which in turn, will kick-start the overall consumption cycle.  · Low pressure on profitability: Hyper-inflation in key raw material prices, coupled with subdued volume growth, has been posing pressure on profits. However, we believe the company’s margins are likely to inch up going forward as the pick-up in the volumes and market share gains from the unorganized/smaller players trigger operating leverage.  · Superior financial matrix: Relaxo has maintained healthy operating cash flow and asset turns. Moreover, its robust EBITDA Margins over the years have made it one of the most capital-efficient businesses in the industry. We believe a strong balance sheet with zero net debt and efficient working capital should help Relaxo prosper in the long run.  Recommendation: We recommend a BUY on the stock with a near-term TP of ₹1,100/share implying an upside of 11% from the CMP.   Equity investors became poorer by over ₹5.47 lakh crore in early trade on Monday amid an extremely weak trend in the broader market with the Sensex plunging over 1,500 points. The 30-share BSE benchmark tanked 1,568.46 points to 52,734.98 in early trade. The broader NSE Nifty slumped 451.9 points to 15,749.90.

Nifty The Nifty gave away all its previous day’s gains and ended Friday’s session with a loss of more than 250 points. SGX is suggesting the Nifty opening below the 16000 Put base strike. If it sustains below it that will take it towards the recent low of 15750. Bank Nifty On Friday, Bank Nifty slipped lower on the back of selling pressure in private sector banks. According to option data, the Bank Nifty is likely to face selling pressure at higher levels as 35000 Call strike holds sizable OI, which should act as immediate resistance.

India and other Asian nations are becoming an increasingly vital source of oil revenues for Moscow despite strong pressure from the U.S. not to increase their purchases, as the European Union and other allies cut off energy imports from Russia in line with sanctions over its war on Ukraine. Such sales are boosting Russian export revenues at a time when Washington and allies are trying to limit financial flows supporting Moscow's war effort. India, an oil-hungry country of 1.4 billion people, has guzzled nearly 60 million barrels of Russian oil in 2022 so far, compared with 12 million barrels in all of 2021, according to commodity data firm Kpler. Shipments to other Asian countries, like China, have also increased in recent months but to a lesser extent.   We have been continuously alluding to the key support of 16300 – 16260 on a closing basis. These levels are finally broken which has negated the minor upward trend that emerged during the previous week after surpassing the 16400 mark. The market is unable to show any kind of strength at higher levels; but despite this, we are still not getting convinced with the weakness. We would rather reassess the situation in the first half of this week and all eyes on crucial levels like 16000 on the lower side and 16400 on the upside. The pragmatic strategy would be to stay light on positions and stock specific also, we are seeing a lot of whipsaws on either side. In fact, it has become a nightmare in trading stocks in the last couple of weeks. Let’s see how things pan out going ahead and we are still hopeful of some recovery in the coming days. If this has to happen, US markets need to provide that much-needed relief.   The rupee slipped 36 paise to its all-time low of 78.29 against the US dollar in early trade on Monday, tracking the strength of the American currency overseas as investors flocked to the safe-haven currency amid an overall risk-averse sentiment. Forex traders said weak Asian currencies, a lacklustre trend in domestic equities and persistent foreign capital outflows weighed on investor sentiments. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 78.20 against the American dollar, then lost ground to quote at 78.29 -- its record low level, registering a fall of 36 paise from the last close. On Friday, the rupee tumbled 19 paise to close at a fresh lifetime low of 77.93 against the US dollar   The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has adjourned till 14 June hearing of Amazon's petition opposing initiation of insolvency proceedings against debt-ridden Future Retail Ltd.

On 6 June, the Mumbai bench of the tribunal held a virtual hearing in the matter. BoI's petition is yet to be admitted.   On weekly charts, Nifty has formed a long bearish candle indicating further downtrend from current levels. If the index falls below 16150, it could fall to 16000-15850 levels. A fresh pullback rally is possible only after the 16300 breakout. Above which, the index could move up to 16400-16500.   Canadian private equity major Brookfield and its associates have signed definitive agreements with IndInfravit Trust to fully sell five of its operational road projects for a consideration of $1.2 billion.

Equities shed about 2% in Japan and South Korea. US equity futures slid, with Nasdaq 100 contracts down 2% and those for the S&P 500 1.3% lower.

He also said the new asset reconstruction company would be formed by September. Bajaj Auto: The two-wheeler maker has said that its board of directors on 14 June 14 will consider a proposal for buyback of fully paid-up equity shares of the company.

The data are expected to show annual consumer-price gains of more than 8%.  India's benchmark indices slumped today, registering their worst week in four, led by losses in IT, financials, banks and metal stocks. Declines were largely the result of a surge in oil prices and concerns over aggressive tightening by central banks to rein in high inflation. European stocks also extended losses as investors braced for US inflation data that may help decide the course of the Federal Reserve’s tightening path. Back home, the benchmark Sensex tanked 1,017 pts to end the day at 54,303.44, while the Nifty fell 276.30 points to 16,201.80. All sectoral indices ended in the red. On the Nifty, Bajaj Finance, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Hindalco and Reliance Industries were the worst hit. Shares of Grasim, Apollo Hospitals, Dr Reddy's, Asian Paints and Divis Labs rose.   Passenger vehicle dispatches to dealers in India rose over two-fold last month on a low base of Covid-19-hit May last year. As per the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), passenger vehicle wholesales rose to 2,51,052 units last month as compared to 88,045 units in May 2021. The two-wheeler sales rose to 12,53,187 units in May as compared to 3,54,824 units in the year-ago period.

The same stood at 4,44,131 units in the preceding year.   Nifty June series sentiment remains weak. Sell on rise advisable for the near term. Only a strong matured reversal will change the monthly outlook. Selective stocks are available at medium term value levels while broadly risk reward remains skewed. Liquidity remains the main reason behind the current corrective phase.   Gold discounts in India this week were stretched to their highest level in seven weeks as higher prices repelled demand, while fresh concerns over the spread of COVID in top-consumer China left buyers reluctant to make purchases. This week, dealers in India were offering a discount of up to $10 an ounce over official domestic prices — inclusive of the 10.75% import and 3% sales levies, up from the last week's discount of $9. Retail buying in India will remain weak, especially from rural areas as farmers focus on planting of summer-sown crops, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a private bullion importing bank.   European shares extended losses to a fourth session on Friday, as market participants braced for May U.S. inflation data that could guide the Federal Reserve's policy decision next week. All sectors were trading well in negative territory, with banks weighing the most on the pan-European STOXX 600 index, which lost 1.3%. The index was on course to end the week about 2.5% lower - its sharpest decline since early May. Concerns also mounted about demand and growth in China, the world's second-largest economy, after Shanghai and Beijing went back on fresh COVID-19 alerts on Thursday and imposed new lockdown restrictions. The U.S. Labor Department's Consumer Price Index was expected to have accelerated to 0.7% last month from 0.3% in April. But when stripped of volatile food and energy products, it was seen cooling a nominal 0.1 percentage point to 0.5%.   The basket of crude oil that India buys has hit a decade high of $121 per barrel, but retail selling prices of petrol and diesel continue to remain frozen.

As per the PPAC, the Indian basket of crude oil averaged $111.86 per barrel between February 25 and March 29 - the immediate period after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent oil on fire. It averaged $103.44 a barrel between March 30 and April 27. International oil prices held near a 13-week high on Thursday, underpinned by robust demand from key buyers like the US.

India, the world's third biggest oil importer and consumer, has expedited efforts to double ethanol blending with gasoline to 20% from the current 10% across the country from 2025/26. The Indian government fixes the ethanol purchase prices for fuel retailers - Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp -- every marketing year. However, the fuel retailers have announced they will pay extra to ethanol manufacturers to compensate for high energy and power costs, a BPCL spokesman said. The three state fuel retailers have announced the 'relief scheme' for June 1 to Nov. 30. The companies will pay an additional 1,604 rupees ($20.62) per kilolitre for ethanol produced from sugar cane juice, and 1,493 rupees for B- heavy molasses and 1,179 rupees for ethanol produced from C-heavy molasses, the letter showed. The B-heavy molasses juice has some sucrose content left in them for sugar production, whereas C-heavy molasses is a cane by-product that has no sugar content left in it. For a kilolitre of ethanol produced from damaged foodgrains and rice, the relief is fixed at 2,337 rupees and 1,437 rupees, the letter showed. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070, and is encouraging industries to switch to cleaner options including renewable and biofuels to cut carbon footprint.   The IMF has said it was concerned by the use of food and fertilizer export restrictions by some nations which can exacerbate global price increases and market volatility and welcomed India's recent decision to relax its originally announced ban on wheat exports and allow some shipments to proceed. A senior International Monetary Fund official observed that some 30 countries have curtailed exports of commodity goods including food and fuel since the war in Ukraine began.   (Details here).   The Indian Metrological Department (IMD) has forecasted a normal monsoon for calendar year 2022. In its second long-range forecast, IMD said that it expects rainfall during the current monsoon season to be 103% of the long-period average. For the fourth year in a row, the monsoon season is expected to be normal. However, in a report dated 9 June, economists at Barclays said, “Despite an early start, the progress of monsoon has been tepid so far. Cumulative rainfall during 1-9 June was 41% below the long-period average (LPA), though it remains too early to draw any meaningful conclusions, given that it is still very early in the monsoon season.""

(Read here)   Fitch Ratings on Friday revised its outlook on India's long-term foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to ""Stable"" from ""Negative,"" citing diminished downside risks to medium-term growth. The ratings agency said risks to the country's medium-term growth lessened due to rapid economic recovery and easing financial sector weaknesses, despite near-term headwinds from the global commodity price shock.   We believe strong support for the Nifty is placed at 16100 zone. However, for a meaningful pullback to materialise the index needs to decisively close above past three session’s identical high of 16500 to extend the pullback towards last week’s high of 16800. Else, there will be prolonging of consolidation in the 16500-16100 range amid stock specific action   Dasatinib is indicated for treatment of adult patients with i) newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase. ii) chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib. iii) Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.

The US inflation data, due today, is expected to set the tone for the US Fed’s next policy decision. While a 50 basis point is very much in the cards, the forward looking commentary for future action could be greatly influenced by today’s data. While many have been peddling the possibility of the inflationary trend to be levelling out, today’s data will possibly validate or negate the same. Globally, the central banks seem to be operating in unison to stamp out inflation using interest rate hikes. The ECB announced on Thursday that it will prepare a quarter-point interest rate hike in July and suggested a bigger hike in the fall over long-lasting high inflation. The inflation in the Eurozone now exceeds 8%. The ECB also said that it will end net asset purchases on July 1, 2022. This didn’t build confidence for the bullion bulls, resulting in small correction in prices . Rising US treasury yields didn’t help the cause either.   Gold edged down on Friday and was set for a weekly fall, as Treasury yields rose, with investors awaiting key monthly U.S. inflation data for cues on the future of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Spot gold eased 0.2% to $1,844.78 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures eased 0.3% to $1,848.10. Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields edged up, hurting demand for zero-yield gold.

On Thursday, the rupee fell by 6 paise to close at 77.74 against the US dollar. Asian and emerging market peers have started mixed, while Asian equity remained under pressure and could weigh on sentiments, Iyer noted.

Updated: 31 May 2022,Know more about revised third party motor insurance premium starting June 1st,https://www.livemint.com/brand-stories/know-more-about-revised-third-party-motor-insurance-premium-starting-june-1st-11653974986872.html,"The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) have recently announced the revised base premium of third-party insurance plans. The new premium will be effective from June 1, 2022. As per the revised premium rates, private cars with engine capacities of up to 1,000 cc will attract an increased rate of Rs. 2,094. On the other hand, while cars with engine capacities ranging from 1,000 cc to 1,500 cc need to pay a premium of Rs. 3,416, those with more than 1,500 cc engine capacity will have premium rates of Rs. 7,897. For two wheelers, if the engine capacity is between 150 cc up & 350 cc, the premium rate will be Rs. 1,366. Above 350 cc, the premium amount will be Rs. 2,804. One can also select three-year insurance plans that come with separate premium rates. How does the increase in premium rates impact motor insurance policies? Since the third-party insurance plan is mandatory by law, these changes in premium rates will significantly impact all existing and intending policy buyers. Moreover, the hike in third-party insurance premium rates will result in a price rise of vehicles in both the two and four-wheeler segments. Consequently, new-vehicle buyers will have to spend more money when purchasing two or four-wheelers as they will need to buy a three-year policy, and bike owners purchase a five-year policy. Impact of change in third-party insurance premium (for private, hybrid, commercial and electric vehicles) As per notifications from the insurance regulator and ministry, there will be a discount of 7.5% and 15% on the premium amount applicable for hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles, respectively. Electric private cars above 30KW will attract premium rates of Rs. 1,780, and those within the range of 30KW and 65KW will need to pay the premium of Rs. 2,904. Moreover, the commercial vehicles carrying goods that exceed 12,000 kgs but not 20,000 kgs will need to pay a premium of Rs. 35,313. In case of commercial vehicles exceeding 40,000 kgs, the premium rates will be Rs. 44,242. These premium rates for different categories of vehicles will vary depending on the policy, which can be short or long term. It is mandatory for vehicle owners to buy a third-party insurance plan along with an own damage cover. Such insurance policies cover injuries caused to third party individuals or damage to any property in an accident involving the insured vehicle. Besides, according to the notification, a rebate of 15% on the premium amount has been provided to the educational institution buses, and 50% has been offered to private cars registered as vintage models. Role of IRDAI and MoRTH in the change of premium prices In recent years, there have been various predictions regarding the change in the premium rates of motor insurance plans. Inline with the predictions, IRDAI recently proposed amendments regarding third-party car insurance policy rates, and MoRTH has declared the new rates applicable for different categories of vehicles. However, the insurance price for commercial and private vehicles have been kept minimum. Nonetheless, the new insurance premium rates will significantly affect the affordability of the policy buyers. Although a third-party insurance policy is a must-have for all vehicle owners, some reputed insurance providers like Bajaj Finance, in association with other leading insurance companies, extend motor insurance policies at affordable premium rates and additional benefits. Bajaj Finance allows you to check and compare the insurance rates offered by various insurance providers online and select one that suits your requirements."
Updated: 26 May 2022,Here’s why the right time to invest in a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit is now,https://www.livemint.com/brand-stories/heres-why-the-right-time-to-invest-in-a-bajaj-finance-fixed-deposit-is-now-11653552797564.html,"Investing your hard-earned savings in financial tools is a sure-shot way of beating inflation and growing your savings over time. When shortlisting a tool to park your funds, you must consider critical pointers. Risk appetite, applicable interest rates, liquidity requirements, earnings, financial goals and market conditions, etc., are a few variables that you must compute before locking in your funds in any instrument. While the market-linked instruments like stocks, mutual funds and crypto give you higher returns, they also come with the inherent risk of eating into your initial capital. Going from a mid-risk to a low-risk instrument can cancel out this risk. Financial advisors always suggest diversifying investments to mitigate risks. A fixed deposit with high Fixed Deposit interest rates is a perfect tool to invest in when you aim to grow your savings and diversify your portfolio. With the dynamic changes in the market, the humble fixed deposit is under the spotlight as a perfect tool to invest in to safeguard your earnings. Read on to know more about why this is the right time to invest in an FD. Five reasons why this is the right time to invest in a fixed deposit: 1. Mitigate risk and diversify the portfolio In light of the current dynamic market movements, it becomes essential to reserve a chunk of your savings to invest in fixed-income instruments like a fixed deposit that has a constant interest rate throughout your chosen tenor. It will ensure capital preservation and interest gains per your applicable FD rates. 2. Repo rate change The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), governed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), revised the repo rate on 4th May 2022. They increased it to 4.40% from 4% due to inflationary concerns. With the sudden hike in repo rate by 40 bps and Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by 50 basis points to 4.5%, interest rates on fixed income instruments like fixed deposits were speculated to rise. Hence, now investing in a fixed deposit is an intelligent choice, as they will likely offer higher FD rates. 3. The overall increase in FD rates With the increase in repo rate, Banks and NBFCs offering FDs across the country have hiked their FD interest rates. They are making this the ideal time to take advantage of a higher rate regime and earn more than you usually could have. Bajaj Finance hiked their FD interest rates as well. Citizens under the age of 60 can earn up to 7.20% p.a., and senior citizens get an additional 0.25% p.a. on their investments, totalling the applicable interest rates up to 7.45% p.a. on each deposit. 4. Stable investment tool Since these are not linked to market movements, the rate at which you book an FD remains constant throughout the tenor making it a safe instrument to invest in. Most Bank FDs and Post office FDs are backed by the government, making it inherently safe to park your hard-earned savings. Whereas, while investing in FDs offered by NBFCs, one must always check the safety ratings bestowed by the leading rating agencies like CRISIL and ICRA. 5. Estimate returns in advance Using an online FD calculator can easily calculate your returns at maturity. When you know how much you will earn at the end of the tenor, you can alter your tenor and initial deposit accordingly to achieve your financial goals seamlessly. Considering the points mentioned above, it is clear that now is more than an ideal time to invest in this tool. But with multiple FD options available in the market, investing in the right one can seem daunting. Here’s a quick lowdown on why the Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit is the perfect FD investment option. 1. Minimum initial deposit amount You need not have a large corpus to invest in an FD with Bajaj Finance. With just Rs. 15,000 in your account, you can easily book an FD and grow your savings. 2. Flexible tenure Bajaj Finance FD offers flexible tenures from 12 to 60 months to investors, along with special tenors holding higher return rates like 24, 33 and 44 months. 3. Attractive FD interest rates Benefit from a higher rate regime. Avail of rates up to 7.20% p.a. on your deposits if you are in the age bracket below 60. If you are a senior citizen looking to invest in an FD with Bajaj Finance, you can enjoy returns up to 7.45% p.a. on your deposits. 4. Loan against FD facility Get an easy loan against your FD when facing a cash crunch or in the case of an emergency. All of this in just under a few minutes and without liquidating your investment. 5. Credible investment tool Bajaj Finance has been accredited with the FAAA and MAAA and awarded by CRISIL and IRCA. These ratings indicate the highest safety for your money. 6. Online investment process With an easy 100% online investment process, investors can conveniently book an FD from anywhere at any time. Why wait any longer? Invest in a Bajaj Finance online Fixed Deposit to make most of your savings. Disclaimer: This article is a paid publication and does not have journalistic/editorial involvement of Hindustan Times.

Updated: 19 May 2022,Smart insights to getting the best personal loan interest rate,https://www.livemint.com/brand-stories/smart-insights-to-getting-the-best-personal-loan-interest-rate-11652950746831.html,"Personal loans are considered one of the best credit instruments for salaried individuals. They are specifically designed for people with a steady income who face immediate funds requirements for various reasons. You can avail yourself of an online personal loan at the best personal loan interest rates for medical emergencies, setting up a home gym, going on a vacation, and even covering wedding expenses. Going for personal loans online is a convenient option as it also gives you the chance to use a loan EMI calculator. This handy tool helps you calculate your precise EMI amount for the loan amount you seek. An online personal loan allows you to use the disbursed amount you see fit. Another advantage of a personal loan is that no collateral is required. To get the best personal interest rates with lenders like Bajaj Finserv, you must ideally have a high CIBIL Score of 750 and above. If you anticipate any extra expenditure soon, here are some tips that will help you get the lowest interest rate personal loan: 1. Compare interest rates Check what interest rate your primary bank offers, and even if you find it satisfactory, check out the personal loan interest rates of other lending institutions. This will give you an idea about the ongoing market rates and allow you to make the best decision for yourself. You can also negotiate with your bank or financial establishment and ask for a lower interest rate. But your powers of negotiation depend largely on your credit score and history. 2. Floating vs. Fixed interest rates Banks often compute the overall interest rate of your online personal loan through different computing methods. Some banks charge flat interest rates, while others use a floating method. A flat interest rate is calculated directly on the principal amount right when processing the loan. The entire payment liability, including the interest, is divided into EMIs. On the other hand, a floating interest is applied on a progressively diminishing principal balance. This implies that the interest component of your EMI reduces with every payment. While a fixed interest rate is easy to calculate and manage, a floating interest rate is, without a doubt, more economical in the long run. You can use a loan EMI calculator to better understand how these interest rates work. 3. Build and maintain a solid credit score Your credit score plays a vital role in determining your eligibility for a personal loan. Most banks require you to maintain a credit score of 750 or above, as this is a straightforward indicator of your repayment capacity. A higher credit score allows you to negotiate with your bank for the lowest personal loan interest rates. The best way to build your credit score is to pay all your credit card bills and EMIs on other loans quickly. And never, ever default on any loan! 4. Keep a check for offers from the lender Banks often launch special offers on occasions such as Diwali, New Year, and Independence Day and grant personal loans at relaxed interest rates. Going for an online personal loan is ideal when a lending institution has slashed its rates but getting to know about the offer in time is the trick here. To ensure you don’t miss out on any festive deals, you should subscribe to newsletters and WhatsApp groups of all the major banks in the country. Checking out the official portals of banks periodically is also a good idea. 5. Keep your documents ready Online personal loans are disbursed quite fast and are offered without collateral. Banks, however, rarely, if ever, compromise on the eligibility criteria. Since a personal loan is disbursed without collateral, it is a high-risk investment for the bank. Thus, lending institutions ensure that they grant loans only to eligible and deserving candidates. Here are the conditions you must meet to avail yourself of a Bajaj Finserv Personal Loan: - Any Indian who meets the age criteria of 21 to 67 years* - Minimum salary of Rs. 22,000 or higher based on your city of employment. - Employment in any MNC, private or public company - A credit score of 750 and above Ensuring that you fit the eligibility criteria and have the documentation ready is the right way of making sure your application gets processed quickly. Lenders like Bajaj Finserv offer personal loans of up to Rs. 25 lakh at attractive interest rates. The Bajaj Finserv Personal Loan comes with no hidden charges, and you can avail of this loan by filling out their online application form.

State Bank of India: The board of State Bank of India has approved raising up to $2 billion via overseas bond sales.

ICICI Bank: Merrill Lynch India Equities Fund Mauritius Ltd on Tuesday sold 4.80 lakh shares of ICICI Bank worth ₹34 crore through an open market transaction.

Updated: 10 May 2022,Here’s all you should know about hike in FD rates by Bajaj Finance,https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/heres-all-you-should-know-about-hike-in-fd-rates-by-bajaj-finance-11652113666303.html,"Bajaj Finance Ltd, a non-banking finance company (NBFC), has raised its fixed deposit (FD) rates, effective Tuesday, with the highest rate now fixed at 7.45% for senior citizens for a period of 44 months. For non-senior citizens, the highest FD rate stands at 7.20% for the same tenor (44 months). A 12-month cumulative FD will fetch 5.75%, while a 15-month FD will get 6% (for non-senior citizens). Here is why a hike in fixed deposit rates by Bajaj Finance matters. After interest rates were cut amid the pandemic, many customers found the FD rates offered by NBFCs better than those at banks. Both banks and NBFCs are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Among NBFCs, two institutions have become popular for their corporate FDs—HDFC Ltd and Bajaj Finance. Now, with the impending merger of HDFC Ltd with its associated bank, Bajaj Finance is likely to benefit and see further growth in FDs. Bajaj Finance started accepting FDs from individuals in January 2014. The size of its FD programme has since grown to ₹30,800 crore (as of Q4, FY 22). Bajaj Finance primarily earns money by giving loans and it accounts for an overall customer base of 57 million. Its net non-performing assets stood at 0.68% as of March 2022. FDs help the company access capital at competitive rates, thereby creating a model similar to that of a bank. Bajaj Finance can also cross-sell financial products to its FD holders—a base of 3.5 lakh depositors who have around 8 lakh FDs with the company. In total, FDs account for 19% of Bajaj Finance’s liabilities at a group level. Its FDs are rated AAA by CRISIL and ICRA. Interest rates on Bajaj Finance FDs are slightly higher than what banks offer. The highest rate (for senior citizens) will be 7.45% with effect from 10 May. Bajaj Finance allows you to start FDs of tenures ranging from 12 to 60 months. On average, Bajaj Finance depositors create FDs of ₹3.5 lakh and keep them for a period of 30-33 months with the company. “You don’t have to go to a branch anymore. You can book FDs end-to-end on our website or app and around 9% of our deposits come from this direct route,"" said Sachin Sikka, executive vice president and group business head for deposits & investments at Bajaj Finance. ‘Going direct’ does not get you a higher interest rate. The company tried to offer a 0.1% higher rate to direct customers, but subsequently rolled it back. However, during the pandemic, the lender worked hard on improving the experience on its website and app, thereby making it easier for customers to directly start FDs. The website gets around half a million visitors per month for deposits, according to Sikka, and about 7-9% of those who start the journey ultimately book a FD. Sikka is particularly proud about the nudges on the NBFC’s website that encourage people to choose the highest possible interest rate. For instance, the company has a special high rate for a tenure of 44 months. According to Sikka, there are alternatives to FDs like government bonds or even deposits that can be started with small finance banks. However, there is a lack of awareness about how to buy the former even after the creation of the Retail Direct Platform by the RBI. Small finance banks are covered by a ₹5 lakh guarantee by the Deposit Guarantee Corporation of India, but are still to gain popularity among customers. However, savers should also note the pitfalls here. Penalties for premature termination of FDs are higher at NBFCs than banks. The interest rate payable, in such cases, is 3% less than the lowest interest rate on the application form if the FD is terminated within 1 year, and 2% of the applicable rate if terminated after 1 year. In other words, if you terminate your FD after 12 months and the applicable interest rate is 7%, you will get a 5% interest rate instead. In contrast, banks generally charge a 1% penalty. NBFCs are also not covered by the ₹5 lakh guarantee provided by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC). NBFC deposits are not secured by assets—you have to rely on the financial health of the institution you are placing your money with. Bajaj Finance has FDs for tenures ranging from 12 months to 60 months. However, according to Sikka, most FDs are in the 30-36 months bracket, suggesting a cautious approach byhousehold savers. Bajaj Finance raised interest rates on its FDs recently—on 25April. However, given the surprise 0.4% hike in the repo rate by the central bank on 4 May, the NBFC is going for another hike on 10 May. Savers should watch out for further rate hikes in the current scenario before deciding to book an FD. Shorter deposit tenures will also allow you to reinvest the maturity proceeds at higher rates, if interest rates keep climbing."

Overnight, risk aversion swept away a relief rally after the US Fed raised interest rates by the most since 2000 but pushed back against talk of super-sized increases. Markets will remain volatile until there is a clear picture of Fed rate policy and its trajectory   Indian equity markets closed deep in the red on Friday, in line with global peers, on worries over interest rate hikes and inflation. Globally, stocks slid as risk aversion and volatility gripped markets beset by inflation and growth fears. U.S. futures dropped, signalling extended losses after Thursday’s slide of more than 3.5% in the S&P 500 index and 5% in the Nasdaq 100 gauge.  Back home, benchmark Sensex fell 866.65 points, or 1.56%, to end the day at 54,835.58, and Nifty was down 271.40 points at 16,411.30.  Among sectors, IT, metal, and realty indices fell 2-3%. BSE midcap and smallcap indices fell 2% each.

Online food aggregator and delivery platform Zomato’s co-founder and chief executive officer Deepinder Goyal said he is donating the entire proceeds worth ₹700 crore ($90 million) received after vesting some of his employee stock option plans (ESOPs) to Zomato Future Foundation (ZFF). Goyal was granted some ESOPs before Zomato went public last year and some of the ESOPs were vested last month, said Goyal in a statement. There’s a minimum one year vesting required as per law.   Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Friday said India will be able to conclude a free trade agreement (FTA) with the European Union by next year. Speaking at an event organised by the IMC Chamber of Commerce, Goyal said the country has already sealed pacts with the UAE and Australia, and is in negotiations with other countries or blocs including the EU, UK, Canada and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). “By next year, we would be able to conclude an FTA with the EU,"" Goyal said, adding that a delegation from Italy including its foreign minister is in New Delhi now with which he will be having deliberations.   Europe's stock markets fell on Friday in a global selloff rooted in worries over rising interest rates and surging inflation. London's benchmark FTSE 100 index dropped 0.5% to 7,467.66 points, one day after the Bank of England hiked interest rates to a 13-year peak and highlighted UK recession risks. In the eurozone, Frankfurt's DAX index shed 0.8% to 13,793.22 points and the Paris CAC 40 lost 1.2% to 6,293.10.   Russia's Rosneft sold 700,000 tonnes of Urals oil loading from Baltic ports of Primorsk and Ust-Luga in May to Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the country's top refiner, two traders familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. Rosneft allocated seven cargoes of 100,000 tonnes each loading between May 15 and 31 to IOC, according to the traders. In May IOC will load Rosneft-sourced Urals oil volumes from Baltic ports for the first time. Previously the major buyers of the cargoes were trading firms Vitol and Trafigura. However, international traders will stop purchases of oil from Rosneft after May 15 as EU sanctions over several Russian companies come into effect. Last December IOC and Rosneft signed a term contract for supply of up to 2 million tonnes of Urals oil until the end of 2022.   World food prices eased slightly in April after hitting a record high in March, but global food security remained a concern because of the difficult market conditions, U.N. food agency said on Friday. The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 158.5 points last month versus an upwardly revised 159.7 for March. The March figure was previously put at 159.3.   Angel One expanded its client base to 9.64 million in April, a 118.1% YoY growth. The company’s gross client acquisition for the month stood at 0.44 million, a 41.5% YoY increase. The 66.14 million orders, a 65.7% YoY rise, in April 2022 indicates the high level of client activity on the company’s platform.   Macro Factors & Earnings Continue to Weigh On Market Sentiments: April has exhibited a rather mixed performance across all sectoral, market cap, and style indices, which indicate some change in the underlying market regime. Though some recovery was seen in the equity market after a major selloff on 24th February, the trend is likely to be range-bound moving forward.  During the month, Commodities, Energy, Auto and FMCG indices performed well while IT and Media indices reported a significant decline. While Small Caps suffered the most, they also recovered from the 24th Feb’22 bottom rather swiftly. Nifty 50 has recovered 5% since the 24th Feb’22 sell-off. On a positive note, the broader market witnessed a much faster recovery over the same period with Mid and Small Caps recovering by 11% and 13% respectively.  The prevailing geopolitical developments are likely to continue being at the centre stage for some more time before it concludes in a more concrete direction. The market will also continue to eye on rising Covid-19 cases and the impact of lockdown in China. Consequently, its performance is likely to be range-bound in the near term. We believe most of the CY22 returns are expected to be back-loaded and H2CY22 is likely to be less volatile than H1CY22. Keeping these developments in perspective, we value it at 22x FY24E earnings and maintain our Dec’22 NIFTY50 target of 20200 unchanged.   State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has won 18 of 21 areas offered for finding and producing oil and gas in the sixth bid round under Open Acreage Licensing Policy, according to upstream regulator DGH.

India is facing its worst power crisis in over six years, and officials have been scrambling to arrange supply for power plants whose pre-summer inventories are at over nine year lows and as power demand is set to rise at the fastest pace in at least 38 years. Over 43% of the plants fired by imported coal, which have a total capacity of 17.6 gigawatts (GW) and account for 8.6% of India's total coal power capacity, are currently idle. Officials have also decided to invoke an emergency clause in the country's electricity law to allow the plants to run.

At 1115am, the benchmark was Sensex was at 54,669.77, down 1,032.46 points, 1.85%, while Nifty fell 314.05 points to 16,368.60. The benchmark indexes were on track for a fourth straight weekly drop, shedding more than 6%, weighed down by a surprise interest rate hike by the Reserve Bank of India, foreign fund outflows and mixed corporate earnings results. So far this week, foreign investors have net sold Indian equities worth $635 million, compared with $881 million offloaded in the same period last week, according to Refinitiv data.   An Indian court has put on hold a federal enforcement agency's decision to seize $725 million from local bank accounts of China's Xiaomi Corp for suspected violations of foreign exchange laws, two sources told Reuters on Friday. The Enforcement Directorate last week seized the bank assets of Xiaomi Technology India Private Limited, saying it had found the company illegally remitted funds to three foreign-based entities, including one Xiaomi group entity, ""in the guise of royalty"" payments. Xiaomi had denied any wrongdoing, saying its ""royalty payments and statements to the bank are all legit and truthful"". It later filed a challenge against the Indian financial crime fighting agency's decision in the High Court of the southern Karnataka state.   Standing firm – reiterate as preferred bet among two wheelers TVSL 4QFY22 were largely in-line to our/street estimates. EBITDA margins over last few quarters (ex of 1Q) have been strong at >10% despite multiple headwinds. With volume recovery over low base, we expect margins to expand by 80bp/30bp at 10.2%/10.5% for FY23E/24E. TVSL currently trades at 23x/19x of FY23/24 EPS (v/s HMCL at ~15x/12.9x and BJAUT of 17x/14.5x). We believe it should continue to trade at a premium as we expect EPS CAGR of ~31% over FY22-24E. EV focus continues to intensify with more capex/investments towards the same. We believe sustained market share gains in domestic EV 2Ws led by aggressive product pipeline, scope of external investments in to EV vertical and NBFC TVS credit are additional re-rating triggers. We re-iterate TVS as our preferred pick among 2W names with BUY and TP of Rs779 (v/s Rs789) with FY23/24 estimates tweaked marginally.   The volatility was clearly on the higher side and the way we concluded the weekly expiry, certainly does not bode well for the bulls. But we reiterate, that we would avoid getting carried away by this; because we believe markets are a bit oversold and the last two days’ move could be a deceptive one. Hence, rather than jumping into this, we would stay on the sidelines and would assess the situation for the next 2 – to 3 days.  As far as levels are concerned, 16600-16500 are to be treated as immediate supports, while 16900-17000 has now become a sturdy wall.    Indian equity markets fell over 1% on Friday, tracking a decline in Asian peers as U.S. stocks fell sharply overnight on worries the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike this week may not be enough to help fight surging inflation. All sectoral indices were in the red, with IT, metal, realty indices down 2% each. At 10am, Sensex was down 838.13 points, or 1.50%, at 54,864.10, Nifty fell 259.70 points to 16423. The benchmark indexes looked set to fall for a fourth straight week.   Strong Growth and market share gains in core business in tough environment Aggressive towards expansion/innovation via ecommerce We are maintaining our EPS estimate of 11.5/13.8 for FY23/24 on expectations of strong growth in drinks, beverages and foods, IBD & increasing share of e-commerce innovations. We expect near-term growth pressures given input cost inflation, slowdown in rural demand & overall decline in discretionary consumption. However, we remain positive on long term outlook given 1) Innovation led growth strategy, 2) Increasing share in foods & beverages category 3) LUP Innovations allowing DABUR to leverage its distribution 4) Cost saving initiatives and 6) Strong rural distribution coverage of 90k villages (30k added in FY22) 7) 4-5% incremental sales every year from ecommerce innovations. Dabur remains a formidable play on recovery in rural demand in coming quarters. Dabur trades at 38.2x FY24 EPS with 16% EPS CAGR over FY22-24 and 24% ROE and 50% dividend payout. Retain accumulate with 12 month DCF based target price of Rs603 (unchanged).

Updated: 04 May 2022,"RBI's rate hike takes market by surprise, investors wealth dips ₹6.27 lakh cr",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/rbi-s-repo-rate-hike-takes-market-by-surprise-investors-get-poorer-by-rs-6-27-lakh-cr-11651669310286.html,"Markets snapped on Wednesday as RBI surprised by hiking the repo rate by 40 basis points sending shockwaves among investors. On BSE, investors' wealth plummeted by more than ₹6.27 lakh crore in just a single day indicating that investors were not prepared for RBI's sudden hike. However, the possibility of the same was on expected lines but not so soon indeed. Another surprising factor was the retainment of the accommodative stance. A rate hike was much-needed case for taming the mounting inflation and maintaining liquidity stability!  RBI has been expected to hike repo rates to tackle soaring inflation which has reached well above the comfort zone of the central bank. With this, RBI also continues to move in the direction of ensuring sufficient liquidity. RBI is seen to be tilting towards a hawkish stance amidst inflationary pressure like the other central banks globally.  BSE Sensex closed at 55,669.03 down by 1306.96 points or 2.29%. The benchmark had touched an intraday low of 55,501.60. There was massive selling pressure among heavyweight stocks. Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Titan, IndusInd Bank, HDFC Bank, Dr. Reddy's Lab, and Maruti Suzuki bearing the brunt with a downside of 3-4.5%. Reliance Industries the most valued company in terms of market cap, also plunged by over 3%. However, power stocks namely Power Grid and NTPC defied the bearish tone of broader markets and outperformed. A broad-based selloff was witnessed across sectoral indices. Consumer durables, metals, banking, auto, and pharma stocks were the worst hit. The market cap of BSE slipped to ₹2,59,60,852.44 crore on Wednesday compared to the previous day's valuation of ₹2,65,88,212.16 crore. With that, investors' wealth on BSE dropped by ₹6,27,359.72 crore in a single day. Among the top 10 most valued companies on BSE, RIL held its top position with a market cap of ₹18,21,904.37 crore followed by TCS at ₹12,74,246.35 crore, HDFC Bank at ₹7,52,513.31 crore, Infosys at ₹6,46,147.16 crore, and Hindustan Unilever at ₹5,09,802.56 crore. Other companies in the top 10 market capitalisation were ICICI Bank with a valuation of ₹5,03,125.11 crore, State Bank of India at ₹4,28,024.37 crore, Adani Green Energy at ₹4,17,975 crore, HDFC at ₹3,99,980.44 crore, and Bharti Airtel at ₹3,96,853.89 crore. NSE Nifty 50 settled at 16,677.60 lower by 391.50 points or 2.29%. The benchmark has touched an intraday low of 16,623.95. RBI has increased the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 40 basis points to 4.40% with immediate effect. Further, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted to 4.15%, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 4.65%. Despite hiking policy rates, RBI decided to retain an accommodative stance while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward while supporting growth. RBI's decision is intending to achieve a medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4% within a band of +/- 2% while supporting growth. Also, the rate hike came as a surprise during the launch of the mega IPO of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). The nearly ₹21,000 crore LIC IPO which is the biggest of all time on the market, opened today. On Day 1, the IPO received cumulative bids of 10,52,64,180 equity shares against its offered size of 16,20,78,067 equity shares - subscribing to 65% of the total issue. Unmesh Kulkarni, Managing Director Senior Advisor, Julius Baer India said, ""The markets have obviously been taken by surprise, and the 10-year benchmark g-sec yield jumped intra-day to 7.40%. Given the enhanced government borrowing calendar this year, RBI has a tough job at hand, to manage the market's expectations of yields while seeing the weekly auctions through in a non-disruptive manner."" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, ""Although the rate hike was anticipated, the sudden announcement of a 40bps increase in repo rate along with a 50bps increase in CRR in response to the rising inflation spooked markets leading to a heavy selloff. Global markets are also trading cautiously ahead of the upcoming Fed meeting, as an increase of more than 50 bps will extend the current consolidation phase"" ""Wednesday’s decision shows RBI's commitment to tackle inflation, which has been ruling high and at the higher end of RBI's comfort zone. Also, given the expectations of a 50 bps rate hike by the US Fed, RBI possibly wants to pre-empt the Fed action, in order to ensure stability in the currency and capital flows,"" Kulkarni added, ""The CRR hike is a further step in RBI's liquidity normalisation drive, as it attempts to tame the persistent high inflation."" On the accomodative stance, Kulkarni added that ""the RBI MPC surprisingly retained its accommodative stance, even after Wednesday's repo rate hike and CRR hike. While RBI is committed to ensuring sufficient liquidity, the policy stance looks to have already changed to neutral-to-hawkish, which it may officially announce in the June MPC meet."" The RBI repo rate hike will have an impact on banks' lending and deposit rates. The interest rate change in home loans, car loans, and personal loans will be keenly watched ahead. Banks have already started to increase the MCLR benchmark way ahead of the RBI's sudden rate hike."

Updated: 27 Apr 2022,Bajaj Finance Q4 results: Why investors are not impressed,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/bajaj-finance-q4-results-why-investors-are-not-impressed-11651039994899.html,"Shares of Bajaj Finance Ltd. fell about 5% on the National Stock Exchange in opening deals on Wednesday. The non-banking financial services company (NBFC) had announced its March quarter results (Q4FY22) after market hours on Tuesday. While the performance was largely in line with analysts’ expectations, net interest income (NII) which grew 25% year-on-year (y-o-y) to ₹4,803 crore, missed estimates of analysts of Motilal Oswal Financial Services by 7%. Consolidated net profit surged 80% year-on-year (y-o-y) to ₹2,420 crore on the back of a 29% y-o-y growth in assets under management to ₹1.97 trillion. Asset quality also improved, as gross NPAs (non-performing assets) fell to 1.6% as on 31 March 2022 from 1.79% a year ago. Going forward, the key factors to track in FY23 include progress on its digital transformation journey, potential entry into credit card business from its own balance sheet, pressure on net interest margin (NIM) amid increasing competition. “NIM is likely to compress in FY23, driven by a pressure on yields, absence of large IPO (initial public offering) financing (under new Reserve Bank of India guidelines), and expectations of an increase in borrowing cost,"" said analysts at Motilal Oswal in a report on 26 April. Bajaj Finance intends on building a web platform, phase-1 of which is expected to go live by October 2022 and phase-2 by March 2023. This means that operating expenses to NII ratio would remain elevated in FY23 and management expects this measure to remain in the range of 34.5-35.5% in FY23. Note that this ratio increased 390 basis points (bps) y-o-y to 34.6% in FY22. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. In FY22, the customer franchise grew 19% y-o-y to 57.6 million. The management expects addition of 8-9 million customers in FY23. It has no plans to convert into a bank and aims to build a strong payment and finance business. “This may address any overhang from a potential transition into a bank and the impact on growth and profitability. We largely maintain our earnings forecasts and see a 39% CAGR in profit over FY22-24 and return on equity of 22% in FY23,"" said analysts at Jefferies India in a report on 26 April. CAGR is compound annual growth rate. The analysts also remarked that while the NBFC is growing at a faster pace, it is well priced into the valuation."

The sharpest increase is for the 22 month period, where an investor who earned 5.65% p.a. earlier will not be able to enjoy 6.25% p.a.

The rise in the interest rate is applicable on all deposits made on or after 25th April 2022. Take a quick look at all the features a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit investment offers. 1. Increased FD rates: In recent years, fixed deposits have been considered a relatively slow investment instrument. However, this isn’t the case with Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposits. Bajaj Finance promises a higher return with an FD rate of 7.35% than most other banks. Customers below 60 years can earn 6.40% for 24-35 months and 6.90% if they choose a tenor of 36-60 months.

For senior citizens, the applicable special interest rates are: 3. Invest safely: While some other forms of investments promise better returns, they come with a serious caveat of market fluctuations. A fixed deposit, however, is a considerably secure mode of investment. Moreover, Bajaj Finance also flaunts a high safety rating with the FAAA and MAAA certifications by CRISIL and ICRA, respectively. 4. 100% online process: Bajaj Finance online FD offers an end-to-end online application process. The 5-step process takes less than 10 minutes and can be completed on laptops, mobile phones, or tablets. While existing customers only need to verify their details, new customers can save considerable time thanks to the online KYC process. Subsequently, payments can also be made using net banking or UPI. 5. Periodic payouts: Bajaj Finance allows one to opt for regular payouts of the accrued interest. Investors can choose from four payout options – monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly. Senior citizens who need funds periodically benefit hugely from this feature. 6. Periodic savings: Bajaj Finance also offers a Systematic Deposit Plan (SDP) for those who prefer to save small and periodic amounts to meet larger financial goals. Bajaj Finance also provides a Systematic Deposit Plan (SDP). Unlike a regular fixed deposit, where one must invest a lump sum amount, an SDP gives the freedom of making stable monthly savings.
