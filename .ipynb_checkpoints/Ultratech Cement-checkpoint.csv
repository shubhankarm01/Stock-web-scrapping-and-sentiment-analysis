Updated: 08 Jul 2022,How an Indian cement maker bought Russian coal using yuan,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/exclusive-how-an-indian-cement-maker-bought-russian-coal-using-yuan-11657240560306.html,"An Indian cement maker's recent purchase of Russian coal using yuan involved India's biggest private lender, HDFC Bank, according to an invoice seen by Reuters and a source, as more details emerge of the kind of trade that could blunt Western sanctions against Moscow. There is no suggestion that the purchase, the particulars of which have not previously been reported, in any way breaches sanctions imposed on Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. But the document shows one way in which Russia could continue to sell commodities abroad without settling in U.S. dollars despite restrictions aimed at freezing it out of financial markets. According to the invoice dated June 5 and a source familiar with the matter, HDFC Bank backed cement maker Ultratech's purchase of Russian coal from producer and trader SUEK for 172.7 million yuan ($25.74 million). The letter of credit for the deal was issued by HDFC Bank's Mumbai suburban branch of Andheri East, according to the invoice.  The dollar is the currency of choice for global trade in raw materials, but some traders say the yuan could be increasingly used to settle payments for supplies from Russia.  In the invoice, SUEK requests Ultratech remit the 172.7 million yuan to SUEK's account at the Shanghai branch of China Everbright Bank. SUEK lists the Hong Kong branch of international lender HSBC as the correspondent bank.  A correspondent bank acts as a middleman in the transfer of money from one bank to another. Reuters could not determine if a payment had been received by China Everbright or if HSBC or any other bank was involved in a transfer of funds.  HDFC Bank and HSBC declined to comment. Ultratech, SUEK and China Everbright Bank did not respond to requests for comment. It was not clear from the invoice which currencies were used to effect the yuan payment.  The amount listed was quoted in Chinese yuan and Reuters reported last week that Ultratech imported 157,000 tonnes of coal from Switzerland-registered SUEK and agreed to settle the final payment in that currency. YUAN TRADES STILL RARE For India, such payment methods could become more common as it seeks to maintain trade ties with Russia for commodities including oil and coal without the risk of contravening Western sanctions. India has deep political and security ties with Russia and has refrained from condemning the Ukraine war, which Russia says is a ""special military operation"". India's energy imports from Russia have soared recently as traders, unable to sell into many Western markets, have offered steep discounts. New Delhi defends its purchases of Russian goods, saying they are legal and that a sudden halt would inflate prices further and hurt consumers. Greater use of the yuan to settle payments could help insulate Moscow from punishment and bolster Beijing's push to further internationalise the yuan and chip away at the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global trade. It is, however, still rare for an Indian firm to agree to settle a trade with a non-Chinese company in yuan. In the absence of sanctions, overseas payments to Russian commodity and energy companies would typically be made in dollars via SWIFT to Russian accounts. For Indian trade settlements using the yuan, lenders would potentially send dollars to foreign banks with sufficient yuan reserves, or Chinese banks they have tie-ups with, in exchange for yuan to settle the trade. The invoice mentioned the SWIFT transaction IDs of both HSBC's Hong Kong branch and China Everbright's Shanghai branch. Reuters could not confirm whether any payment was made using the SWIFT platform. SWIFT is a secure messaging system that facilitates rapid cross-border payments, making international trade flow smoothly. Several Russian banks have been cut off from the system in recent months. ""As a matter of policy, SWIFT does not comment on flows between institutions,"" a spokesman said. India's bilateral trade with China, for which companies largely pay in dollars, has flourished even after a deadly military border clash between the two in 2020 that ratcheted up tensions that have still not subsided. New Delhi has increased scrutiny on Chinese investments and imports, and banned some mobile apps over security concerns. The Indian government and the central bank were aware of potential payments for Russian cargo in Chinese yuan, sources told Reuters last week. The government and central bank did not comment for this article."

Investor concerns are understandable. Cost inflation has been a pressing worry and margins are expected to be under pressure during the first half of financial year 2023 (H1FY23). Prices of coal and petroleum coke, key inputs used in making cement, remain painfully high, weighing on profitability. “Earnings for UltraTech Cement as well as the cement sector are expected to remain under pressure in H1FY23 and lower than our earlier estimate because of sustained cost pressures (we expect a ₹300-350 per tonne increase in energy costs in H1FY23); the recent decline in cement prices, which came under pressure in June 2022; lower than our estimated growth in cement demand in Q1FY23; and the tendency to increase capacities by different players,"" said a report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services on 29 June.

Updated: 29 Jun 2022,UltraTech Cement paying for Russian coal in Chinese yuan: Report,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ultratech-cement-paying-for-russian-coal-in-chinese-yuan-report-11656495919667.html,"India's biggest cement producer, UltraTech Cement, is importing a cargo of Russian coal and paying using Chinese yuan, according to an Indian customs document reviewed by Reuters, a rare payment method that traders say could become more common. UltraTech is bringing in 157,000 tonnes of coal from Russian producer SUEK that loaded on the bulk carrier MV Mangas from the Russian Far East port of Vanino, the document showed. It cites an invoice dated June 5 that values the cargo at 172,652,900 yuan ($25.81 million). Two trade sources familiar with the matter said the cargo's sale was arranged by SUEK's Dubai-based unit, adding that other companies have also placed orders for Russian coal using yuan payments. The increasing use of the yuan to settle payments could help insulate Moscow from the effects of western sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine and bolster Beijing's push to further internationalise the currency and chip away at the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global trade. The sources declined to be identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media. UltraTech and SUEK did not respond to a request seeking comment. ""This move is significant. I have never heard any Indian entity paying in yuan for international trade in the last 25 years of my career. This is basically circumventing the USD (U.S. dollar),"" a Singapore-based currency trader said. The sale highlights how India has maintained trade ties with Russia for commodities such as oil and coal despite the western sanctions. India has longstanding political and security ties with Russia and has refrained from condemning the attack in Ukraine, which Russia says is a ""special military operation"". It was not immediately clear which bank opened a letter of credit for UltraTech and how the transaction with SUEK was executed. SUEK did not respond to a request seeking comment. The Mangas is currently at anchor near the Indian port of Kandla, according to ship-tracking data on Refinitiv Eikon. INDIA-CHINA-RUSSIA TRADE           "
Updated: 29 Jun 2022,Is the ‘waste heat recovery system’ a saviour for cement companies?,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/cement-cos-esg-issue-has-no-easy-solution-11656436082234.html,"Cement companies continue to make new investments in waste heat recovery systems (WHRS) installations. The sector’s overall cost has spiked in recent quarters mainly because of high fuel costs. Against this backdrop, WHRS is a saviour. It traps the enormous heat generated during manufacturing and generates electricity, which can be used as an additional source of power. Thus, it helps reduce energy costs. If about 10% of power is consumed from WHRS, it could help cement companies save Rs50 per tonne, according to an analysis by Yes Securities. Analysts estimate that the average power generation cost from WHRS is less than Re1 per unit compared to Rs5 per unit from the grid. Power and fuel account for 25-30% of the sector’s total operating costs.       "
Updated: 24 Jun 2022,Top picks: Sharekhan is bullish on these 6 cement stocks for robust gain ahead,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/top-picks-sharekhan-is-bullish-on-these-6-cement-stocks-for-robust-gain-ahead-11656089157281.html,"The leading brokerage firm Sharekhan has placed a buy call rating on the shares of Shree Cement for a target price (TP) of ₹26000, Ultratech Cement (TP: ₹7100), Grasim Industries (TP: ₹1740), The Ramco Cement (TP: ₹850), JK Lakshmi Cement (TP: ₹600), and Dalmia Bharat (TP: 1850). These recommendations were made because the brokerage forecasts that, in accordance with the plans disclosed by major cement players, the cement sector would add more than 90 mtpa in capacity between FY2023 and FY2025. The brokerage has said in a note that “Cement industry is expected to add over 90 mtpa in capacities over FY2023- FY2025 as per plans announced by major players. This implies a 5% CAGR in installed capacity, while cement demand is estimated to post a 6-7% CAGR over FY2023-FY2025. With the rise in supply almost equivalent to demand growth, industry capacity utilizations levels would stay almost flat at 67-68% over FY2023- FY2025. Pan-India cement prices have risen each year during FY2015-FY2022 barring a couple of years, while in Q1FY2023, they are up 8% as compared to FY2022 level. Going by historical anecdotes, we believe cement prices to remain on an uptrend despite capacity additions over the next three years. On the cost front, International petcoke prices have corrected by 17% m-o-m and 20% from March 2022 levels in June 2022."" According to Sharekhan “The diesel prices across Metros declined by 5% m-o-m while they were up 3% y-o-y in June 2022. We expect the easing of petcoke/ coal prices during Q1FY2023 and ahead to reflect in operational performance for the industry from H2FY2023 as it exhausts high-cost fuel inventory fully during H1FY2023. We estimate our cement coverage universe to report 11% CAGR in sales volume over FY2022-FY2024 as against industry growth estimated at 6-7% per annum. Higher-than-industry growth is expected to be lead by market share gains by larger companies aided by rise in capacities."" The brokerage has claimed that “We estimate weighted average EBITDA/tonne for our coverage universe to grow at 4% CAGR during FY2022- FY2024 although the same may remain lower than peaks seen in FY2021. The improvement in EBITDA/tone is based on our assumptions of capacity utilizations remaining almost flat due to high capacity additions, part retention of growth in cement prices and easing of energy and freight costs."" By staying positive on the cement sector, Sharekhan has said “Our cement coverage universe has seen 30%-45% correction in stock prices over trailing five months led by Russia-Ukraine crisis, rise in energy costs and large capacity plans announced by leading cement players. The same has led to one year forward EV/EBITDA valuation multiples of almost all cement companies sinking below their historical averages. Notwithstanding, soft earnings performance for the cement pack in H1FY23, the recent correction offers good entry points for long term investors as sustainable infrastructure push over next 3-5 years coupled with easing out of input cost pressure in H2FY23E would drive stock performance over next 12-15 months. We remain construction and stay Positive on the sector. Our preferred picks are UltraTech, Shree Cement, Dalmia Bharat and JK Lakshmi Cement."" Weakness in demand, a decline in cement prices and a rise in key input costs like energy and freight costs are key risks to the industry, said Sharekhan, which investors should take note of.

Updated: 07 Jun 2022,The Adani versus Birla battle in a prized market for cement,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/the-adani-versus-birla-battle-in-a-prized-market-for-cement-11654619859936.html,"Gautam Adani’s meteoric rise to the world’s ninth-richest person began with a port on India’s west coast in the 1990s and friendship with a politician who’s now prime minister. The rest has been all about finding the next industry that will enlarge his debt-fuelled empire. The port brought in coal, liquefied gas and palm oil, and so Adani got into these and adjacent businesses. Once he began supplying coal to power plants, he entered mining and electricity generation and distribution. He supplied piped gas to Indian cities, and set out to harvest solar and wind power. Extending his dominance in logistics to owning airports, grain silos and data centres was logical, as was selling a cooking medium: He just had to refine Indonesian palm-oil arriving at Indian ports, of which he now owns 13. Finally, if the group was going to create infrastructure, why not produce cement? In its most recent expansion, Adani is paying $10.5 billion. In this field, his challenger isn’t arch-rival Mukesh Ambani, the only Indian tycoon richer than Adani, it’s another billionaire. Kumar Mangalam Birla comes from old money, unlike Adani, a first-generation entrepreneur. His great-grandfather, who diversified from textile trading to jute manufacturing and a lot else, was a confidant of Mahatma Gandhi during India’s freedom struggle. Birla’s father, stymied by a post-1947 socialist turn, globalized the commodities conglomerate by expanding in Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines. Birla bought Novelis in 2007 to become the world’s largest aluminium-rolling firm. But then Birla had to deal with the 2008 financial crisis, followed by a boom-bust in China’s commodities demand and a long expensive entanglement in telecom, an industry disrupted by Ambani’s 2016 foray with cheap data and free voice calls. While a government-backed rescue for Vodafone Idea Ltd has prevented it from going belly up, a new battle has begun. Adani is challenging Birla in India’s vast and expanding market for cement. No surprise then that Adani’s Holcim India acquisition evoked a quick response. Birla-controlled UltraTech Cement Ltd has announced a capital expenditure of ₹12,900 crore to increase its cement capacity by 22.6 million tonnes per annum. That works out to $75 per tonne. Adani is paying almost double that per tonne for taking over an estimated 73 million tonnes per annum capacity this year at the two Holcim units, Ambuja Cements and ACC. If Adani is going to buy scale at a premium, Birla will build cheap. The game is on. Birla’s telecom business got bruised when Ambani waged a price war. But it’ll be hard for Adani to beat Birla in the latter’s family borough of cement. Birla, who was worth $6.5 billion in early 2013 when Adani wasn’t even a billionaire, is now almost $85 billion behind. But he knows his cement: UltraTech’s current capacity of about 120 million tonnes per annum gives it a market share of 20%, ahead of the 12% Adani just acquired. It isn’t, however, an assured lead. As Kotak Institutional Equities has noted, Adani has the option of expanding to 100 million tonnes relatively cheaply, at $80- 90 per tonne. That’ll cut his acquisition cost. UltraTech has a $3.20-$3.90 advantage over Holcim in how much earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization it can eke out per tonne. Kotak says that Adani can close the gap by merging the two acquired firms, ending royalties to Holcim and saving costs via waste heat recovery. But Birla isn’t without options. He, too, will enter adjacent industries, such as paints. It’s too early to say who will win India’s building-material war, though one thing is certain: Birla won’t take another challenger lightly. In 2017, when he decided to merge his Idea with Vodafone’s India business, he may have thought that scale would protect him from relentless pricing attack by Ambani’s Reliance Jio. It didn’t. The government won a case in the Supreme Court over past dues from cellular firms, putting Vodafone Idea’s survival in doubt. Finally, New Delhi had to offer a bailout to prevent the telco market from becoming a Reliance-led duopoly. Cement isn’t as highly regulated as telecom. But Birla must still rue the ease with which Adani beat his rival bid—and one more by another Indian billionaire—for Holcim’s assets by agreeing to take over any liability emanating from a price-fixing case brought by India’s trustbuster. The real question before Birla, however, runs deeper. If Adani plans to dethrone him as India’s king of cement, what’s the right response: Fight or flight? His great-grandfather, the patriotic Ghanshyam Das Birla, bet on Gandhi and won against British rulers and their companies like Andrew Yule & Co. Going up against Adani, who also views himself as a nationalist businessman, may be no less of a gamble in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s India. Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services in Asia."

To protect its market share amid rising competition, Ultratech Cement Ltd announced fresh capital expenditure last week. It will increase capacity by 22.6mtpa (million tonnes per annum) by FY25. After the completion of this round of expansion, Ultratech’s grey cement capacity will grow to 159.25 mtpa. That Ultratech would expand capacity was expected, but the sector is going through a rough patch now. As things stand, cement demand is yet to see a meaningful recovery and the industry’s pricing power remains weak. Aggregate volumes of the sector rose sequentially, but were flattish year-on-year, reckon analysts. Dealer channel checks by various brokerages show cement demand improved in April-May, but only slightly. With the onset of the rainy season, demand is likely to be subdued in June.         "

Updated: 23 Mar 2022,Cement price outlook muted for East India,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/cement-price-outlook-muted-for-east-india-11648057381490.html,"Cement companies are seen exiting the March quarter (Q4FY22) with flat prices, despite Q4 being seasonally strong. In the following quarter, Q1FY23, cement makers are expected to raise prices amid steep cost inflation, showed dealers channel checks by various brokerages. Higher realizations would help the sector prevent the erosion of operating margins. However, the eastern region is unlikely to see a meaningful increase in prices as it suffers from an acute demand-supply imbalance. Oversupply in this market against the backdrop of inadequate cement demand growth would weigh on prices, at least in the near term. If demand fails to absorb the supply, the region’s utilization can be expected to stay low. Of the total slated capacity additions of 27.5 million tonnes in FY23, 13.1 million tonnes is scheduled in east India alone, according to estimates of JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd.     "

Updated: 04 Mar 2022,Cement stocks under pressure as price hikes offer little solace,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/cement-stocks-under-pressure-as-price-hikes-offer-little-solace-11646369777074.html,"There is no light at the end of the tunnel for investors in cement stocks, at least for now. Shares of key cement manufacturers Ultratech Cement Ltd, ACC Ltd, Ambuja Cements Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd have dropped 12-8% in the last five trading sessions. This is despite dealers' channel checks indicating that price hikes have been taken in some regions. On a month-on-month basis, cement prices have risen by 4-5% in southern, western and eastern India, according to Jefferies India Pvt Ltd's report dated 3 March. On the other hand, the northern region saw a month-on-month price decline of 2%. Two crucial factors have not played out as per expectations of the Street. In a double whammy, costs are feared to rise futher and uptick in demand has not been as strong as previously anticipated. It should be noted that cement companies use crude-derived petroleum coke (petcoke) and imported coal as key inputs. Prices of these commodities were already elevated, but the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict could add to further upward pressure on supply constraints. ""There has been a substantial increase (up 75%/52%) in South African/Australian coal prices in the last one month (40-50% increase in two weeks),"" domestic brokerage house Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a report on 2 March. At present, imported coal prices are significantly higher than their peak in October 2021. For example, the South African coal price stood around $300/tonne versus its peak of $248/tonne. Petcoke prices too have started to rise, added the report. Analysts caution of peak margin pressures for cement companies in the June quarter of FY23. As far as demand growth is concerned, there is no cheer on that front as well. It should be noted that March quarter is seasonally strong for the sector and has historically seen meaningful uptick in construction activities. However, this time around demand so far in the quarter, has remained muted. ""Demand was weak in Feb'22 like Jan'22 - while dealers attribute to increasing costs of construction materials like steel/sand, companies attribute it to a high base,"" said the Jefferies report. Given the unimpresaive demand scenario, analysts at Jefferies see a risk to their estimate of Rs40 per bag increase in cement prices in Q4FY22. Needless to say, for cement companies the risk of earnings downgrades is getting more pronounced. ""Variable costs are expected to remain elevated in H1CY22 and may pose downside risks to our / consensus FY22-24E earnings in the absence of cumulative Rs45-50/bag price increase during H1CY22,"" analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd said in a report on 2 March."
Updated: 02 Mar 2022,Super 15: Stocks benefitting from rising popularity of ESG theme ,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/super-15-stock-benefitting-from-rising-popularity-of-esg-theme-11646195130371.html,"In a post-Covid world, conscious investing has gained lot of traction among investors. In fact, in 2021, at a global platform, India made a commitment to reach net carbon zero by 2070. With the environment, social and governance (ESG) theme fast catching-up, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd have outlined key considerations for investors and picked stocks from five sectors to bet on this theme. They are as follows: 1) Coal Sector: The fundamental question for India's transition is linked to its coal sector. Ensuring a well-planned and just transition away from coal will be a significant challenge, with both risks and opportunities in the power sector and beyond. With around 8% of state revenue from coal activities, diversification of the economy is needed. Coal India Ltd will be central to the transition. The company has already taken steps to diversify into renewable power, with three gigawatts of planned solar capacity to FY24. Natural gas is also set to play a significant role in displacing coal. GAIL India Ltd operates around 220 mmsmd (million metric standard cubic meter per day) of pipeline capacity and is the largest LNG trader in India. 2) Agriculture accounts for around 20% of India's greenhouse gas emissions and is the main source of non-carbon dioxide related emissions. Opportunities exist for investors through chemical free farming and low-cost solutions which improve irrigation and energy efficiency. UPL Ltd will likely play a central role in decarbonisation efforts. Through various projects, it is driving the adoption of digital solutions and increased penetration of bio-solutions. 3) Road Transport: With auto demand set to grow to 2040, an uptake in electric power-trains is an important area of focus for policy-makers. Tata Motors Ltd leads the local market with nearly 7% market share. Bajaj Auto Ltd, TVS Motor Company Ltd & Hero MotoCorp Ltd are actively expanding their electric vehicles portfolios. 4) Power Utilities: State-run distribution companies will underpin India's energy transition. Their financial fragility however currently inhibits their appetite for investment and transformation of the power grid. NTPC Ltd should be a key beneficiary of new renewable capacity given its access to low cost funding. Power Grid Corporation of India, Larsen & Toubro Ltd, Siemens Ltd and KEI International Ltd could all see tailwinds from increased transmission and distribution spend. 5) Heavy Industry: Heavy industry's share of energy consumption has increased to 42%, making it the largest end user of energy. Incumbents are focused on renewable power with Shree Cement Ltd, The Ramco Cements Ltd and Ultratech Cement Ltd all active in this regard."

UltraTech Cement shares are down near 1 per cent, Shree Cement share are down 0.50 per cent, JK Cement share price is quoting 1.50 per cent lower from its yesterday's close, Ramco Cements shares shed around 1 per cent whereas ACC cement shares are down near half a per cent today. According to stock market experts, cement shares are under pressure ahead of Ambuja Cement results as market is expecting weak Q3 numbers from the cement major. They said that market is trying to adjust with the new EPS (earning per share) and P/E ratio of the cement companies comparing with the P/E ratio and EPS of Ambuja Cement in the wake of weak Q3 results. They went on to add that major reason for weak Q3 results from cement major is rising input cost after surge in coal prices.    "

Akin to peers Ultratech Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd, ACC's sales volumes fell, while input cost rose. It should be noted that Ambuja Cements Ltd is yet to announce its December quarter earnings. ACC's sales volume was down 3% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 7.49 million tonne. The company follows a January-December accounting year. Ultratech and Shree Cement saw sales volume decline 3% y-o-y and 8.3% y-o-y in Q3FY22. High variable cost continued to hurt, leading to contraction in ACC's operating margin to 13.1% in 4QCY21 from 14.1% in Q3CY21. Hit by a surge in coal prices, power and fuel cost on a per tonne basis rose 27% year-on-year in Q4CY21. In a positive, however, due to its master supply agreement (MSA) with Ambuja, freight cost and raw material costs declined in Q4CY21 compared to Q4CY20. Understandably, ACC shares were muted on Thursday, trading flat on the National Stock Exchange, in reaction to the company's December quarter performance. Nonetheless, the stock’s performance in the last one year has been impressive. ACC shares have risen 31%, outperforming Ultratech’s 17% returns in the same span. Shree Cement stock price has declined 9% in the last one year. In the last five years, ACC shares have given lower returns than Ambuja, Ultratech and Shree. In the the last three years, ACC shares have risen by 66% compared to 110% surge in Ultratech and 80% jump in Ambuja shares. Analysts say the company’s expansion plans are on track and its cost rationalisation measures are yielding results and driving optimism towards the stock.   "

In today’s article, we compare and contrast two of the top cement players, UltraTech Cement and ACC. The idea is to study their past, to eliminate risks, and profit from their future. Background ACC: ACC is one of the oldest cement companies in India with a rich history. It was bought by the world leader in cement, the Swiss based Holcim group in 2004.                                                                "

Except in the north, demand in other markets remained muted, impacted by cyclones in the east and south, and reduced cement demand from the infrastructure segment in the central region. Further, elevated input costs meant consolidated operating margin contracted sharply to 20% from 28% in the same period last year. In Q2FY22, margin was at 24%.         "

Should you buy?     The payment landscape in India is rapidly evolving with digital payment ecosystem leading the change, over traditional payment modes. Interestingly, while digital payment ecosystem adoption, led by UPI, has been growing fast, cash-in circulation (cash-to-GDP) also rose to 14% in FY21 from 8% in FY17. Further, within various payment / withdrawal instruments, micro-ATM (mATM) deployment continues to outpace the growth in cards, PPIs and ATMs in FY22-TD. Even on a high base of 49% YoY growth in FY21, mATM deployment has risen by a strong 32% in FY22-TD, followed by prepaid cards at 27%. On the contrary, bank-led ATM network and card issuance (both debit & credit) grew in single digit at 1% / 4% respectively between Mar-Oct’21. In mATM space, Fino continues to dominate with 49% market share as of Nov’21, in total deployed devices. SBM Bank India (12% market share), City Union Bank (3%), NSDL Payment Bank (3%) and Yes Bank (4%) are aggressively tapping the mATM space during past 6-9 months. Other leaders including SBI, BoB, IDFC, among others, appear to be rationalising their network. On the withdrawal-volume side (AePS), total throughput in Apr-Oct’21 (7 months) was already ~74% of total FY21 throughput.

Consumer confidence among urban Indians fell 3.4 percentage points month-on-month in January, with consumers reporting a significant decline in their personal financial conditions, according to the monthly Primary Consumer Sentiment Index or PCSI released by Refinitiv-Ipsos.   Technical View The Nifty Realty index is regaining upward momentum after undergoing healthy retracement over past three months. Within the space we remain constructive on Godrej Properties as stock has logged a resolute breakout from falling channel, indicating conclusion of secondary corrective phase that in turn augurs well for resumption of primary trend. Thereby offering fresh entry opportunity with favourable risk reward setup Key point to highlight is the stock has witnessed a slower pace of retracement as over past ten weeks it retraced 80% of preceding 4 weeks rally (| 1602-2598). The slower retracement indicates robust price structure that bodes well for extension of upward momentum.   Consumer goods company Unilever Plc’s – that made three separate offers for GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK) consumer business – comes nearly two years after its Indian arm Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) successfully merged with GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Limited (GSKCH) in India, giving it access to health food drinks brands, such as Horlicks, Boost and Maltova in the country. The 2020 deal has given HUL heft in the nutrition category in India. Unilever also acquired rights to health food drinks brands in around 20 other predominantly Asian markets.   Infrastructure engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) major KEC International on Friday said it has bagged new orders worth ₹1,065 crore across various businesses. Its Transmission & Distribution (T&D) business has secured orders for projects in India, the Middle East, Africa, and Americas. While the railways business has secured an order for construction of railway siding in the conventional segment in India, the civil business bagged an order for infra works in the water pipeline segment in the country. The oil & gas pipelines business has secured an order for laying of oil and gas pipeline, through the company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Spur Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, it said in a statement. The cable business has bagged orders for various types of cables in India and overseas.   Indian Oil Corp. Ltd. (IOCL) plans to expand its city gas distribution (CGD) business, looking to invest ₹7,000 crore over and above the ₹20,000 crore already planned for the vertical. In the recent round auctions by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Board, the company bagged 9 of the 15 high potential GAs (Geographical Areas). Analysts say that these investments can create value and will be earnings accretive, but the gains will accrue only over time. The pipeline infrastructure and expansions will take some time to complete while the bidding has been aggressive. There may be more upfront investments in terms of capex. All these are key factors to look out for, as per analysts. Also, since the geographical areas are relatively large, the company’s earnings can see upside of 4-5% but only over a period of time, said analysts.   ""With the Union Budget 2022 set to be announced, we expect the government to focus on investing in infrastructure that will allow for the total cost of logistics to reduce for the end customer. With some sections of the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor already operational, we look forward for the entire corridor to be completed connecting NCR and major maritime ports viz., Mundra, Piapavav and Nhava Sheva this year and continue its focus on improving infrastructure by prioritising other corridors like the North-South, East-West as well as the East-South and West South for uninterrupted rail movement of freight trains to facilitate domestic cargo movement. This will enable the logistics industry to keep moving ahead. In addition, there should be investments made towards digitization of supply chain management with a focus on new technologies like IoT. With the third pandemic wave and uncertain times ahead, the industry is expecting policy support and tax relaxations that will help boost ease of doing business for the industry. The logistics cost in India is around 5 percent more than the global average which leads to a huge competitive gap. The government should take steps to address the supply chain inefficiencies and reduce the gap.""   India's gasoil sales declined in the first fortnight of January as rising COVID-19 infections hit consumer spending and truck movement in the country.

China’s economy grew by 8.1% in 2021 after an abrupt slowdown in the second half that is prompting suggestions Beijing needs to shore up slumping growth. In the final three months of 2021, the world’s second-largest economy expanded at a 4% annual pace, government data showed Monday. That is down from the previous quarter's 4.9% and an eye-popping 18.3% in January-March. Activity slumped under pressure from Beijing on the real estate industry, a key growth driver, to cut debt levels that Chinese leaders worry are dangerously high.   Asian stocks were mixed Monday ahead of data expected to underline China’s economic slowdown and as traders weighed policy easing by the nation’s central bank. Shares rose in Japan, were flat in Australia and slipped in South Korea. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures fell. The yen declined and a gauge of the dollar edged higher. U.S. stock and bond markets will be shut Monday for a holiday. A real estate downturn and power shortages may have contributed to the weakest Chinese expansion in more than a year last quarter. The nation is also grappling with partial shutdowns to stem the spread of Covid-19. The People’s Bank of China lowered key policy rates. Bond yields in Australia and New Zealand advanced after a slide in U.S. Treasuries at the end of last week. The 10-year U.S. yield is back up at levels seen before the pandemic roiled global markets in 2020.  "

Updated: 10 Dec 2021,Ambuja Cement vs UltraTech Cement: Which is Better?,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ambuja-cement-vs-ultratech-cement-which-is-better-11639113023679.html,"India is the second largest producer of cement in the world. Availability of raw materials like limestone and coal make India a desirable destination for cement production. That is why many international firms such as Holcim Group and Heidelberg Cement, have invested in the Indian cement industry. According to the India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF) report, India has more than 7% of the world’s installed cement capacity. Ambuja Cement and UltraTech Cement are two of the well-known players in this industry. In this article, we compare these two companies based on their operational efficiency, profitability, and their future growth prospects.

Updated: 01 Nov 2021,The race for ‘most valued listed Indian cement stock’ gets intense,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/the-race-for-most-valued-listed-indian-cement-stock-gets-intense-11635750150961.html,"The valuation gap between Shree Cement Ltd and UltraTech Cement Ltd has continued to narrow. With that, the race for India’s most expensive listed Indian cement stock is getting exciting. At a one-year forward EV/Ebitda of around 20 times, Shree Cement has managed to maintain the top spot, at least for now. EV is short for enterprise value. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.  UltraTech Cement is trading at a valuation multiple of around 17 times, shows Bloomberg data.  But with September quarter earnings a mixed bag and competitor UltraTech's slew of cost-rationalisation measures, Shree Cement’s tag of most valued listed Indian cement stock is at a greater risk. In the September quarter, Shree Cement’s volumes declined 3.3% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 6.32 million tonne given its higher exposure to eastern India, which is facing a situation of over-supply. On the volume growth front, peers have performed better in the September quarter. Analysts note that Shree Cement’s volumes are lower than industry average, suggesting a marginal reduction in market share for the company. However, a miss on volume was offset by higher blended realisation. Also, a one-time push to operating profit came from that sale of power in the spot market, which contained the decline in Ebitda to 11% y-o-y. Analysts note that Shree Cement maintained a meaningful differential in Ebitda margins over its peers (Ambuja and UltraTech) on back of higher share of cheaper renewable power, indirect tax incentives and logistics advantage.

Updated: 20 Oct 2021,UltraTech's war on debt is eclipsed by cost pressures,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/cost-pressures-eclipse-ultratech-s-deleveraging-11634671055736.html,"It is widely known that India’s cement sector is grappling with cost inflation. Even industry leader UltraTech Cement Ltd is feeling the heat. In the September quarter, UltraTech’s operating margin fell 340 basis points (bps) year-on-year (y-o-y) to 22.6% due to energy cost inflation. In a post-earnings conference call, the management said raw material costs rose due to higher slag and gypsum prices. Given the continuous rise in thermal coal prices, the firm has increased its dependence on petroleum coke (petcoke). The composition of petcoke in its fuel mix has risen from 17% in Q1FY22 to 19% in Q2FY22. Yet, the management expects a cost headwind of ₹200/tonne in Q3FY22 from higher fuel prices. The management expects another ₹500/tonne jump in fuel cost in the coming quarters due to higher spot coal prices; however, they see the current surge as transient. Freight costs are also expected to rise due to increased diesel prices.          "
