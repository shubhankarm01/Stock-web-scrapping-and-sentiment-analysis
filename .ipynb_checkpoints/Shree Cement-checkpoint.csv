Updated: 24 Jun 2022,Top picks: Sharekhan is bullish on these 6 cement stocks for robust gain ahead,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/top-picks-sharekhan-is-bullish-on-these-6-cement-stocks-for-robust-gain-ahead-11656089157281.html,"The leading brokerage firm Sharekhan has placed a buy call rating on the shares of Shree Cement for a target price (TP) of ₹26000, Ultratech Cement (TP: ₹7100), Grasim Industries (TP: ₹1740), The Ramco Cement (TP: ₹850), JK Lakshmi Cement (TP: ₹600), and Dalmia Bharat (TP: 1850). These recommendations were made because the brokerage forecasts that, in accordance with the plans disclosed by major cement players, the cement sector would add more than 90 mtpa in capacity between FY2023 and FY2025. The brokerage has said in a note that “Cement industry is expected to add over 90 mtpa in capacities over FY2023- FY2025 as per plans announced by major players. This implies a 5% CAGR in installed capacity, while cement demand is estimated to post a 6-7% CAGR over FY2023-FY2025. With the rise in supply almost equivalent to demand growth, industry capacity utilizations levels would stay almost flat at 67-68% over FY2023- FY2025. Pan-India cement prices have risen each year during FY2015-FY2022 barring a couple of years, while in Q1FY2023, they are up 8% as compared to FY2022 level. Going by historical anecdotes, we believe cement prices to remain on an uptrend despite capacity additions over the next three years. On the cost front, International petcoke prices have corrected by 17% m-o-m and 20% from March 2022 levels in June 2022."" According to Sharekhan “The diesel prices across Metros declined by 5% m-o-m while they were up 3% y-o-y in June 2022. We expect the easing of petcoke/ coal prices during Q1FY2023 and ahead to reflect in operational performance for the industry from H2FY2023 as it exhausts high-cost fuel inventory fully during H1FY2023. We estimate our cement coverage universe to report 11% CAGR in sales volume over FY2022-FY2024 as against industry growth estimated at 6-7% per annum. Higher-than-industry growth is expected to be lead by market share gains by larger companies aided by rise in capacities."" The brokerage has claimed that “We estimate weighted average EBITDA/tonne for our coverage universe to grow at 4% CAGR during FY2022- FY2024 although the same may remain lower than peaks seen in FY2021. The improvement in EBITDA/tone is based on our assumptions of capacity utilizations remaining almost flat due to high capacity additions, part retention of growth in cement prices and easing of energy and freight costs."" By staying positive on the cement sector, Sharekhan has said “Our cement coverage universe has seen 30%-45% correction in stock prices over trailing five months led by Russia-Ukraine crisis, rise in energy costs and large capacity plans announced by leading cement players. The same has led to one year forward EV/EBITDA valuation multiples of almost all cement companies sinking below their historical averages. Notwithstanding, soft earnings performance for the cement pack in H1FY23, the recent correction offers good entry points for long term investors as sustainable infrastructure push over next 3-5 years coupled with easing out of input cost pressure in H2FY23E would drive stock performance over next 12-15 months. We remain construction and stay Positive on the sector. Our preferred picks are UltraTech, Shree Cement, Dalmia Bharat and JK Lakshmi Cement."" Weakness in demand, a decline in cement prices and a rise in key input costs like energy and freight costs are key risks to the industry, said Sharekhan, which investors should take note of. The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.  "
Updated: 20 Jun 2022,Shree Cement’s new capex doesn’t excite,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/shree-cement-s-new-capex-doesn-t-excite-11655748076514.html,"Indian cement companies are announcing fresh capital expenditure (capex) plans amid biting cost pressures and subdued demand, with Shree Cement Ltd the latest to join the bandwagon. The company is setting up a clinker and cement plant with a capacity of 1.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) and 3 mtpa, respectively, in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh at a total cost of ₹2,500 crore, it said on Saturday. The company aims to commission the plant by December 2024. However, this has not enthused investors much. On Monday, the stock dropped to a 52-week low initially on NSE and closed about 2% higher than the previous close. Even so, several challenges are foreseen in pursuing these plans. Plus, capex in Andhra Pradesh is fraught with risks owing to excess capacity. “This capacity addition would cost Shree Cement ₹8,262 per tonne, much higher than the capex made in the past. Second, this plant is situated in Andhra Pradesh, which is an oversupply region where demand is muted. Thus, utilization levels are low. So this will be RoCE dilutive for Shree Cement,"" said Mangesh Bhadang, analyst at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities. RoCE is return on capital employed.      "

Updated: 31 May 2022,Another Adani Group stock may get included in Nifty 50 index,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/nifty-rejig-adani-enterprises-may-replace-shree-cements-in-nifty-50-index-11653974812632.html,"Edelweiss Alternative & Quantitative Research has carried out a pre-emptive analysis of the Semi-Annual Index (SAIR) September 2022 Rejig for Nifty indices. The index provider will officially announce the list in the second half of August 2022. According to the brokerage's preliminary analysis, Adani Enterprises holds a high chance to dislodge Shree Cements in the upcoming Nifty September review for the Nifty 50 index. The only risk factor is of any sharp contra price move in either of the probable names can lead to a change in conviction.  Adani Enterprises will be the second Adani Group stock, if included, in the Nifty 50 index. Currently, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited is part of the index. Shree Cements has a higher probability of being excluded from the Nifty index while the next name on radar, as per Edelweiss, would be Hero Motors. The cut-off date is July 29 whereas the announcement is expected to be in the second half of August and rebal date is September 30, 2022. On the other hand, Nifty Next 50 Index could see probable inclusions of Life Insurance Corporation (LICI), Tata Power, Adani Wilmer, IRCTC, Mphasis Ltd. While, probable exclusions in the index could be Lupin Ltd , Jubilant Foodworks, Zydus Lifesciences, Punjab National Bank (PNB), Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Adani Enterprises. For the Nifty Bank index, Edelweiss said “looks like Status quo. None of the stocks qualify yet, but any significant O/P by Canara Bank or U/P by PNB of 15% till mid of June, which if sustained till July end can lead to changes."" The most important criteria for Nifty 50 Inclusion is that the stock should compulsorily be part of the derivatives segment. For instance, average free float market cap of Avenue Supermarts (DMART), Adani Green Energy and Adani Transmission is significantly higher than most of the existing Nifty 50 constituents, but the stock has not been included in the index for the past few reviews as they are not a part of the F&O segment.  If any of the above mentioned stock gets included in the derivatives segment till the expected announcement date, then it would make it to Nifty 50 index."

The company's operations span India and the UAE, with four integrated facilities in India, one in the UAE, and nine grinding units, and it is one of India's top three cement firms. Shree Cement's stock reached a 52-week low of ₹21,303.60 in intra-day trading on the BSE on Wednesday at around 1:34 PM (IST). The BSE Sensex was down 237 points at 53,815, while the NSE Nifty 50 fell below the 16,100 barrier in afternoon trade. The stock has been losing over the previous 5 days, falling 2.86 per cent in that time. Concerns over a drop in EBITDA owing to the high rise in power and fuel prices have also weighed on the stock. The stock has dropped 18.71 per cent in the last month, and it has dropped 20.12 per cent in the last six months. So far in 2022, the stock has lost 21.78 per cent YTD, and it has lost 21.19 per cent in the previous year. Shree Cement is now trading below its 5-, 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages. On the 24th of May, the delivery volume of 13.77 k fell by -17.58 per cent compared to the 5-day average delivery volume. Its latest trading price on the BSE was ₹21,292.95 down 1.5 per cent.

PAT increased by 2% YoY to INR 23,319 Mn in FY22, but PAT margins shrank by 132 basis points to 15.5 per cent. The brokerage firm KRChoksey has said that “In Q4FY22, Shree Cement commissioned its 3 mtpa grinding unit at Pune, taking its overall capacity to 46.4 mtpa. The company’s current utilization level stands at ~60% giving ample room for future growth by increasing its utilization level in subsequent quarters. The company is on track to achieve its target of 57 mtpa of capacity in next three years time. During Q4FY22, Shree Cement’s sales volume stood at 8 MT, a growth of 22.1% on QoQ basis.

Since our last result update, the stock price has corrected by 11.4% in line with overall market correction,"" said the brokerage. We continue to value the stock at 16x its FY24E EV/EBITDA, which yields a target price of INR 25,085 (previous TP of INR 27,978), giving an upside potential of 14.3% from the current market price.

Updated: 24 May 2022,"Capacity expansion of Shree Cement is on track, but near-term outlook is muted",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/nearterm-outlook-for-shree-cement-is-muted-11653334235019.html,"The March quarter earnings of Shree Cement Ltd, announced on Saturday, were hardly exciting. Hit by higher-than-expected input costs, standalone Ebitda at ₹910.6 crore in Q4FY22, was much lower than consensus estimate of ₹1,010.7 crore. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Muted cement prices in its key market of East India limited its ability to adequately pass on the burden of increased costs, said analysts. Consequently, the decline in operating margin continued. At 22.2%, its standalone operating margins fell to a three-year low in Q4FY22.         "
Updated: 19 May 2022,"The landscape of India’s cement oligopoly, in five charts",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/the-landscape-of-india-s-cement-oligopoly-in-five-charts-11652871713817.html,"Earlier this week, in a move that has significance for the Indian cement sector, the Adani Group announced its acquisition of Switzerland-based cement major Holcim’s Indian assets. In one shot, the Adani Group will catapult to the second spot in a sector that has historically demonstrated an oligopolistic character, with a handful of companies at the top controlling nearly half the capacity, and more. Here’s how that has played out in the last two decades or so, when the sector has grown faster than the economy and delivered market-beating returns. 1. Capacity control Between them, ACC and Ambuja have 65 million tonnes of annual cement manufacturing capacity. As a combine, this is next only to the 120 million tonnes of UltraTech, from the Aditya Birla Group. This troika has shaped the sector and led consolidation in it. Over 1999 and 2000, the Tata Group sold its stake in ACC to Ambuja. In 2005, Holcim entered Ambuja. In between these two transactions, Grasim (an Aditya Birla company) acquired the cement operations of L&T, which is UltraTech today. That was the initial consolidation in the sector at the top, one that has stuck. The top five cement manufacturers account for about 48% of the industry capacity of about 550 million tonnes and the top 10 about 63%. Their share in production will be higher, as their capacities usually operate at above-industry levels. While the industry has been languishing in the low-60% range, for instance, Ambuja did 86% utilization in calendar 2021 and UltraTech 70% in 2020-21.             "
Updated: 18 Apr 2022,What Holcim's likely exit from India means for cement sector's pricing power,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/what-holcim-s-likely-exit-from-india-means-for-cement-sector-s-pricing-power-11650268693591.html,"The cement sector is in the headlines, yet again, but this time, it is not for cost inflation pressure issues. Investors in the sector may need to prepare for the announcement of a landmark deal. Media reports said Switzerland-based building materials conglomerate Holderind Investments Ltd (Holcim) is looking to exit India and is exploring a stake sale in Ambuja Cements Ltd. Holcim holds a 63.19% stake in Ambuja and a 4.48% stake in ACC Ltd. It should be noted that Ambuja also holds a 50.05% stake in ACC. Clearly, if and when such a deal goes through, there would be repercussions not on these stocks but for other companies as well. For ACC and Ambuja a change of ownership could be a re-rating event, note analysts. Investors would reckon that both these companies have been losing market share due to capacity constraints. This is at a time when their close competitors Ultratech Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd were expanding their footprints across regions aggressively. During the calendar year 2011-2016, Holcim lost 460 basis points (bps) market share due to weaker capacity addition, according to Axis Securities Ltd. One basis point is 0.01%. During this period, Shree Cement and UltraTech added 220 bps and 630 bps of volume share, respectively, said the Axis report. Perhaps, a whiff of this potential deal has got investors excited. In April so far, the Ambuja stock has sharply outperformed peers ACC, Ultratech and the broader market, likely reflecting market anticipation for the merger & acquisition news, said analysts at Jefferies India. “In the near-term, while both these stocks may remain afloat on deal newsflows, driving outperformance versus other large-cap peers, Ambuja's recent sharp up-move tilts our preference towards ACC,"" added the Jefferies report. But a bigger near-term positive could come in the form of improved ability to raise prices. Analysts at HDFC Securities Ltd note that the delays in the sell-off, owing to its mega-deal size, regulatory approvals, etc. could potentially derail the focus on ACC and Ambuja's planned expansions. ""This would be good news for the industry as a slower pace of capacity addition will reduce the demand-supply imbalance, supporting industry’s pricing power,"" said the domestic brokerage house in a report dated 18 April. That said, since market share loss has been an irritant for shareholders of ACC and Ambuja, the new buyer is expected to go full-throttle on fixing this. ""In the last decade, Holcim India has lost market share and an unlikely leeway under a new promoter. We see an emerging overhang of market disruption and risk of de-rating on leaders – Ultratech Cement and Shree Cement Ltd,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report on 18 April. According to media reports, Holcim is in early-stage negotiations with the Adani and JSW Group for this deal. Meanwhile, Holcim’s exit from its India cement business should be viewed in the backdrop of its strategy to reduce its carbon footprint by 2025. The company aims to cut its cement business to around 35% of revenue in calendar year 2025 from 55% in 2021. Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brazil are among the regions where Holcim has already off-loaded its stake in the cement business.    "
Updated: 23 Mar 2022,Cement price outlook muted for East India,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/cement-price-outlook-muted-for-east-india-11648057381490.html,"Cement companies are seen exiting the March quarter (Q4FY22) with flat prices, despite Q4 being seasonally strong. In the following quarter, Q1FY23, cement makers are expected to raise prices amid steep cost inflation, showed dealers channel checks by various brokerages. Higher realizations would help the sector prevent the erosion of operating margins. However, the eastern region is unlikely to see a meaningful increase in prices as it suffers from an acute demand-supply imbalance. Oversupply in this market against the backdrop of inadequate cement demand growth would weigh on prices, at least in the near term. If demand fails to absorb the supply, the region’s utilization can be expected to stay low. Of the total slated capacity additions of 27.5 million tonnes in FY23, 13.1 million tonnes is scheduled in east India alone, according to estimates of JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd.     "
Updated: 04 Mar 2022,Cement stocks under pressure as price hikes offer little solace,https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/cement-stocks-under-pressure-as-price-hikes-offer-little-solace-11646369777074.html,"There is no light at the end of the tunnel for investors in cement stocks, at least for now. Shares of key cement manufacturers Ultratech Cement Ltd, ACC Ltd, Ambuja Cements Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd have dropped 12-8% in the last five trading sessions. This is despite dealers' channel checks indicating that price hikes have been taken in some regions. On a month-on-month basis, cement prices have risen by 4-5% in southern, western and eastern India, according to Jefferies India Pvt Ltd's report dated 3 March. On the other hand, the northern region saw a month-on-month price decline of 2%. Two crucial factors have not played out as per expectations of the Street. In a double whammy, costs are feared to rise futher and uptick in demand has not been as strong as previously anticipated. It should be noted that cement companies use crude-derived petroleum coke (petcoke) and imported coal as key inputs. Prices of these commodities were already elevated, but the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict could add to further upward pressure on supply constraints. ""There has been a substantial increase (up 75%/52%) in South African/Australian coal prices in the last one month (40-50% increase in two weeks),"" domestic brokerage house Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a report on 2 March. At present, imported coal prices are significantly higher than their peak in October 2021. For example, the South African coal price stood around $300/tonne versus its peak of $248/tonne. Petcoke prices too have started to rise, added the report. Analysts caution of peak margin pressures for cement companies in the June quarter of FY23. As far as demand growth is concerned, there is no cheer on that front as well. It should be noted that March quarter is seasonally strong for the sector and has historically seen meaningful uptick in construction activities. However, this time around demand so far in the quarter, has remained muted. ""Demand was weak in Feb'22 like Jan'22 - while dealers attribute to increasing costs of construction materials like steel/sand, companies attribute it to a high base,"" said the Jefferies report. Given the unimpresaive demand scenario, analysts at Jefferies see a risk to their estimate of Rs40 per bag increase in cement prices in Q4FY22. Needless to say, for cement companies the risk of earnings downgrades is getting more pronounced. ""Variable costs are expected to remain elevated in H1CY22 and may pose downside risks to our / consensus FY22-24E earnings in the absence of cumulative Rs45-50/bag price increase during H1CY22,"" analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd said in a report on 2 March."
